 Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_879687]  or seizure  suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_879688]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be f ollowed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data .  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst  or se izure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_879689] 
                                                 
1 In this study, the term Super -Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655305] “Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (RSE) that has failed 
standard treatment” and the two terms are used interchangeably.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879690]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_879691] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3).  Subjects who fail the QW w ill have the same or a different third -line agent regimen 
re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be randomized to 
concomit ant SAG E-[ADDRESS_879692] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 63 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 63 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_879693] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are  provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and  Table 2) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_879694] eting the blinded stud y drug 
infusion will be eligible to r eceive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason,  dialysis  that would adequately 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_879699] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_879700] been treated or randomized in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects w ill also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_879701] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis may be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the r esponse rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter .  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879702] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prio r to the end of study treatment infusion 
and remains off third- line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655314]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints ( time to re -institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental  use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which i s defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assump tion of a 25% response rate to placebo treatment , a 
30% treatment difference between SAGE -547 and placebo, and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 63 subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 63 subjects randomized to placebo, 
there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between groups with a 2- sided Chi -
squared test at a 5% level of significance.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (ye s or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V 2 and the open-la bel study drug infusion at V 10.  The weights at V 2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), weight will also be recorde d 
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_879703] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours  (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R  for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically signi ficant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relativ e to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_879704] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 
and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion; and, Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 , 144, and 192 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study 
drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h EC G, there is +/ - 2 hour time window for these ECGs.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior t o the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the  end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose a nd 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to t he end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the  end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step), +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open-label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples m ay be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than  five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte and metabolic  disturbances, anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is 
associated  with  substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655328], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution, peaking in  infants/ young children  and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  
that in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  
population, which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 
2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US  is generally  quoted to  be within  the range of 18/100,000 to  
61/100,000, based  on a 19 -year retrospective study in  [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota ( Hesdorffer, 
Logroscino et al. 1998)  and a 2- year prospective study in Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock 
et al. 1995) , respectively.   Two  studies from  Europe give annual incidences  of a similar  
magnitude, ranging  between  9.9/100,000 and  15.8/100,000 ( Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000; Knake, 
Rosenow et al. 2001) .  It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  
as 150,000 cases  of SE (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first -line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam ( Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012) , which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an 
IV anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; 
Shorvon 2011; Hocker, Br
itton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - 
line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to  approximately 70-80% of patients  who 
receive second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is 
diagnosed as  having refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] ( RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to 
terminate  the seizure activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE

 patients  are immediately  admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a 
medically -induced  coma  to stop all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs  used to induce coma are 
continuously-infused IV agents,  commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital, referred  to as 
third -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   
The goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore 
function and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  
the administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these  
patients  treated  with AEDs  will respond to  the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , 
leaving  up to  28% of  the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   
Based  on the  previously- cited  estimated  incidence in  the US,  this means  that there are  up to  42,000 
incident cases  of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_879718] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent 
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_879719] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “SRSE ” and the two may be used 
interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655330], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used  for SE  
do not generally  differentiate its  nature as  responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and  
two-third s of the RSE  patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013 ).  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655331]- refractory .  A 
recent review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual inciden ce of approximately 
35,000, based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  depe nding on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The  mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.

03 May 2017                                                               31                                                                       Confidential  
            
 The causes  of death  from  SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  
standard treatments.   Prognosis worsens and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. 
with SE that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) , and with longer 
duration of medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet 
medical  need  to improve upon the current  standard  of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors have outcomes ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013) .  In 
all, it is  estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional 
outcome.

conditions, adding and changing  anti-seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning  from  IV

• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or unconsciousness 
(Shorvon 2011) .  
Currently,  there  are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The  
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without

 controls ( Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is  optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents  is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requiring 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to  be most effective in  
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is  also associated  with the most toxic  adverse effect  profile,  comprising  
decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] ( Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The  
ability  to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents  as quickly as possible is therefore  
paramount, and an adjunct  to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents 
and supports their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition to 
the therapeutic armamentarium .  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_879721].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is  an endogenous, naturally  occurring neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS) ( Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985; Paul and Purd
y 1992; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent positive allosteric  modulator of both synaptic and  extra-synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection (allopregnanolone aqueous formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE who have not responded to standard treatment.  SAGE -547 
Injection is a solution of 5 mg/mL allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI),  USP 
and 250 mg/mL betadex  sulfobutyl-ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for 
Injection, USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 
1.67 mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective recruitment of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance 
occurring  in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the 
central  nervous system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  
types  of GABA  receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A 
receptors  are macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  
specific binding sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators,  including barbiturates,  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.  GABA receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes 
significantly  to the normal termination  of a seizure  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is  
a positive allosteric  modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizur e activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing 
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to 
control as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift 
from  inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-
D-aspartic  acid  (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655336] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879722] that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes 
to the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed  during prolonged seizures ( Kapur and 
Macdonald 1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  
GABA A receptors;  extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting  in 
a putative mode of action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655337], gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, 
thereby  [CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of 
the start of seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly 
as possible.  To prevent the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that 
anesthesia be  initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses designed to  induce EEG  
suppression patterns  (Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed  Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled trial , Study 547-
SSE-301; 
• an ongoing  open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or 
placebo), during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the 
Phase [ADDRESS_879723]- line agents while being 
administered SAGE -547 (or placebo) may  be eligible for a second open-label infusion of SAGE-
547 at a higher dose.  Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_879724]  of care 
for SRSE,  a serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  
comprise 20 from  the ongoing Phase 2 trial (7 1% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 
subjects who received EIND  treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_572379],  without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or 
death  during therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_655604], which  is in accord  with the

 efficacy  assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (7 3%) 
subjects  with  SRSE  who  completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_879725] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_879726] received SAGE-547, 6 out of 30 (20%) subjects, appears to be lower than the published rates. None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE-547: brain tumor, 
organophosphate toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655338], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non-fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these 
events to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects 
(20%) experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE-[ADDRESS_879727] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliabl e published 
data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third-line agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879728]-line agents would be reserved for the active control arm; 
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655339], mandating 
the use of prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in 
a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE-[ADDRESS_879729] of 
care alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive with weaning in the SAGE -547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for SAGE -547 show that the compound exer ts central pharmacological effects and is 
associated with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed 
in two ways: firstly all patients receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects 
who fail to be weaned from their third-line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of 
study drug will be administered open- label SAGE -[ADDRESS_879730] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two-thirds of subjects experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid 
conditions.  The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_879731] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose 
are 102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open-label infusion 
of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879732] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE-547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE-547 h as been increased from 120  hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_879733] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for 
exposures in men and women up to [ADDRESS_879734] commonly reported AEs  were sedation 
(recorded as  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild 
headache ( Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported 
(Navarro, Kaddouz et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007; Kask, 
Backstrom et al. 2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the 
reduced consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously- reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majori ty of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also 
experienced SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE-547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 
subjects (10%) were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported 
in 30 subjects (20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE-547 – this is in the context of published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data 
suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_879735] a high  risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and 
Shorvon 2010) .  The  subjects treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_879736]  (IRB)  where the

56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and  the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and  agreements  in this protocol and  in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and  
must also  conduct the study in accordance  with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent 
will be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any  testing  under this protocol not considered standard of care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the situation and consent during the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  
[CONTACT_45822].  The informed consent form (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, 
must follow the Protection of Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The  informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated 
study monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study must be approved by  [CONTACT_655607].  The  ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components 
of the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject 
chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and date 
a specific consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study 
consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given 
and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study 
independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879737] Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in 
all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879743]-line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is 
called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be 
followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and 
outcome data (see Table 3).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line 
agent regimen re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_879744]’s LAR.  The subject will 
then be administered one or more third-line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_879745] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subje cts will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 63 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE-547 and 63 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be

 stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line 
agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE-547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists 
and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents 
starting at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all 
weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_879746] evidence of phys iologic brain 
activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the 
primary endpoint assessment period as determined by [CONTACT_655609] a success.  
Details of the assessments and time points are provided  in the schedule of assessments (Table 1, 
Table 2 and Table 3). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re- institution of a third -line agent 
regimen before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_879747] be confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]-label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on 
SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered 
SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 63 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE-547 and 63 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line 
agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization 
(minimization algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and 
between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization 
process will be included in the SAP.   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE-547 
and placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, 
pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which 
treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE-547 will be administered on an open-label basis to subjects who meet the criteria for open -label treatment.

8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or 
loss of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a ca use for exclusion from any aspect of 
the main study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion 
in genetic research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses , not have received a non-leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_879752]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study drug discontinuation and/or subject withdrawal from the study must be 
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to  an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their  LAR  may  withdraw subjects from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The  Investigator  will also  withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to Visit 10 (or 10R) should complete the procedures 
scheduled for the day  of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day  of their 
withdrawal, including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality assessment  
from Visit 12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study after Visit 10/10R should undergo 
study procedures as outlined for Visit 12/12R on the day  of their withdrawal.  In all cases, the 
reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal of subjects for any  reason should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study 
period. 
The investigator may  withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in 
the exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE considered related to study drug  should be 
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator d etermines the event is  
no longer clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to 
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may  terminate  this study or any  portion of the study at any time for safety  
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
subjects, administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage  
Therapeutics  will provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites  must 
promptly notify their IRB and initiate  withdrawal  procedures for participating  subjects.

 10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the dosing schedules in  Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject  obtained within the eight -hour window that follows the declaration of the QW f ailure at 
V2 and prior to dosing at V3.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the fir st 
infusion of study medication.

 10.4. Trea tment Period  
The treatment period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is  six 24-hour periods (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_879759] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, d etailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third-line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments should 
be documented throughout the study from Screening  through Visit 12/12R, as described below, 
and recorded on the eCRF.  Fo r subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third -line agents,  procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information  (to include the 
name [CONTACT_655711], third -line agent,  procedure, and/or t reatment , and the 
start and stop dates and times ) from Visit 3 th rough Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For 
subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected 
during the screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to 
include the name [CONTACT_655712] 3 
through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated inhibitory effects on  cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital that are primarily  metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 
should be closely monitored  during SAGE -[ADDRESS_879760] “failed 
first-line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant T hird-Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF, whatever path  the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.  This recording of third- line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third- line agent inc reased or failed and this third-
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879761]- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce s edation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support or for another purpose.  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for 
seizure or burst suppression, and use of these third-line agents for these other purposes does not 
constitute a wean failure under this protocol. 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration. 
11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy  
Success or failure will be determined , with success defined as weani ng the subject off all third -line 
agents before completion of the first blinded infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_879762] suppression during the 24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879763] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their inf usion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt during study treatment to wean off all 
third -line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as 
continuous intravenous infusions of pentobarbital/thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine 
at maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure  suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these 
agents that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects 
are on lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of the 
blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.

 • Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and nature of the third- line agent weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of pe rforming 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints (terminal wean and the period after the end of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successf ul) in a timely manner in order to provide 
advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning applies  to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6-24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimiza tion of the AED regimen. 
Weans include the qualifying wean  (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third -line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the 
third -line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent .  The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that 
take place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study 
drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as  possible with intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot 
be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a 
dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third -line agent should be started to replace 
that third -line agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the 
subject of the wean attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying 
wean before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re-
instituted within that [ADDRESS_879764] may then be 
randomized in the study. 
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547.

 • If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_879765]-
line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• If the subject is on three third-line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_879766]- line agent being weaned 
should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one thi rd-line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and 
should begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin as soon a s the last OW is complete but in any case not later than 
H97 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 
hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot 
be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a 
dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third-line agent should be started to replace 
this third -line agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the 
subject of the wean attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complet e the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547, but 
the TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].

03 May 2017                                                                         54  Confidential  
 • Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_879767]-line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG 
being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed from the time of consent (CEEG).  The 
intent is to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for 
the study for that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to 
eligibility, burst or seizure  suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable 
pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst  or 
seizure suppression pattern during the [ADDRESS_879768] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period prior to the QW.   
• EEG will be performed to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_879769]- line agent(s) , the decision to 
re-institute a third -line agent(s) at doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, 
and the decision that the QW is a success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_879770] 12 hours of blinded 
study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent 
(TWEEG).  The TW is the wean of the final third-line agent during the blinded administration of study drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was 
on one third-line agent, the TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three 
third -line agents, the TW is the wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will 
start [ADDRESS_879771] or seizure  
suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.

 • EEG will be performed during the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE- 547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded 
for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary 
endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting 
the open-label infusion of SAGE-547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then 
continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-
547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_879772] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity seen 
during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of 
study treatment or th e open -label infusion of SAGE-547 and the ensuing 24-hour 
period, during which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the 
primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting 
the open-label infusion of SAGE-547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the 
blinded administration of study treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547, and 
then continue for the one hour after the end of the 24-hour assessment period (to Hour 
169 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the 
open-label infusion of SAGE-547).  The duration of the PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_879773].  In some cases 
(the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken 
to service the different  EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de-identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG 
and the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated 
(CEEG, QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655345], as follows:

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to 
integrate several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the 
CGI-Sever ity (Question 1, CGI -S) and the CGI -Improvement (Question 2, CGI -I) employ  a 7-
point Likert scale measuring  severity  of the disease state in the subject and improvement, 
respectively.  All severity  assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879778] question on the scale will not be 
employed in this trial, and where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in 
this trial.

AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed and prior to study- specific  screening 
procedures not considered standard of care, during subject preparation for SAGE-547 
administration and through Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs  will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) coding  system ( current version). See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.

 11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry and GFR will be calculated at:  
• Visit 1 and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_879783] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel 
only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1 and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_879784] en > 30 kg, t hese samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-
hour medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.   GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_156371].  For children 
under 30 kg , results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be 
sent to the central laboratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for additional blood sampling for central laboratory testing.  
Any out- of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment 
about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitro gen (BUN), calcium,  
chloride, creatine kinase,  lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and 
glucose.   In addition triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment 
of lipemia in pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_655614] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women 
may not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_879785] will be ineligible 
for study  participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, 
pH, and specific  gravity.   
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879786] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/-15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/- 30 minutes ) after 
the start o f the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the start of the infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1.  Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will be used to calculate the infusion rates 
throughout the entire blinded treatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open- label s tudy drug, the  
infusion rates for the open- label infusion will be calculated using t he subject’s weight measured 
prior to dosing during V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain an actual weight at the above- referenced time points , permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such 
as information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol).   
In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use 
of a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_879787] be performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours ; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, 
+152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, 
+144, +152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the open-label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant ab normalities in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used: 
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start 
of the blinded (first) study drug infusion

 • pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start 
of the open-label (second) study drug infusion 
It is not necessary to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints  and, apart from 
the +1h ECG, there is +/ - [ADDRESS_879788] has died, 
the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of  death.  
As accurate as possible cause of death will be collected, which will be further categorized as due to 
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic Samples  
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a b lood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1 in order to avoid the possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a sample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE-547.  Specific genetic variations of interest include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra-
family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of 
allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes 
associated with the production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE-547 but also susceptibility to disorders for whi ch SAGE -547 is being evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific 
analysis.  No personal details  sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person 
(internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify 
relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinica l data, 
allow regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Prim ary 
blood samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses 
are possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_879789] visit has been 
reached, or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or the ir consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE-547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol
® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points 
relative to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose) , +3, +6, 
+12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately 
prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655366]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose) , +3, +6,

 • All samples w ill also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/ - 5 minutes; subsequent samples, +/- [ADDRESS_879790] samples taken as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE-[ADDRESS_879791] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations; experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_879792] having two 
infusions of study drug will be 99 ml (33 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., C
max, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879793] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655368] 100 microlitres.  
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE-547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_879794] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be  collected up to the date of 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
03 May 2017                                                                         64  Confidential  
 death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation 
center, a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 
10/10R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
other)?  
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to asses s the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all  +/- 2 hours) after 
the start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)  
The GOS is a relatively  common assessment scale used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE.  It was first 
used in 1975 ( Jennett and Bond 1975)  and allows a prediction of the long- term course of 
rehabilitation to return to work and everyday life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups: 
• Death

03 May 2017                                                                         65  Confidential  
 • Persistent vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability  
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating (SRS) measures the level of supervision that a patient/subject receives 
from caregivers.  The SRS rates level of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally 
be grouped into five ranked categories (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part- Time 
Supervision, Full-Time Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time Direct Supervision).  The SRS was designed to be rated by a clinician based on interviews with the subject and an informant who has 
observed at first hand the level of supervision received by [CONTACT_423] ( Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a 
one-step procedure in which the clinician assigns the r ating that is closest to the subject's level.  
Ratings are based on the level of supervision received, not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted to need. 
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_879795] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is  a commonly used scale to  determine  disability  and 
functional dependence due to  neurological  insult such  as stroke in adults.  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) 
denotes functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to  severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The  
Modified Rankin Scale – 9Q is  a shortened version  consisting of 9 questions that  reliably  
determines  the mRS  score and  was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the 
rater base to  non- medically  trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -
based  tool in  the public domain with  automatic  score calculation  and error  checking  found at 
www.modifiedrankin.com. 
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_879796] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis may  be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]-estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical 
adjustment will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
13.1.2. Study Populations  
The Safety Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded study 
medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to actual treatment.  This analysis 
population will be used for all safety analyses.   
The Intent to  Treat Population is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficac y analyses.
 
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879813] secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the 
cause of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non-completion of the infusion or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655617] .  Acceptable reasons for 
defining a subject as MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of 
the underlying cause of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will exclude 
data from all subj ects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be classified 
according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to 
examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary effica cy endpoints.  
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of 
blinded SAGE- [ADDRESS_879814] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section  11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) 
between SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the I TT 
population using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, 
concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and 
its associated p -value will be presented. T he comparison of treatment response rates will be 
conducted at the 5% level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will 
also be conducted.   
An additional analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third-line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post-
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW.

 13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE-547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section 
(Section  6 ).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, 
the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue 
until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non -significant result.  The 
analysis of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from baseline in CGI, 
secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655375]) will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for 
treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  
Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be 
performed using Analysis of Variance with var iables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too 
many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655377].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire w ill be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the 
samples.   Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component 
of the study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be 
obtained to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis Plan will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.

 13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non-responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summari es will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_879815] on QT/ QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Samp le Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 25% response rate to placebo treatment , a 30% treatment difference between SAGE -547 and placebo, and a 1:1 randomization 
schedule.  Under these assumptions, with 63 subjects randomized to SAGE-547 and 63 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups with a [ADDRESS_879816] at a 5% level of significance.  Randomization will 
be stratifie d by [CONTACT_655591] /thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).   
 
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to b e performed in the study.  
The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
14. ADVERSE  EVENTS 
The safety procedures in this study will be detailed in a Safety Management Plan, which will be 
agreed and signed before the first subject is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs  for relationship  to study drug and  severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB.

 Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical Monitor Responsibilities  regarding monitoring of AE  
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R.  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of s creening  will be captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after  completion of s creening  will be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic procedures, or spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from study personnel will be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Form.  Any  clinically  significant  deterioration in laboratory assessments or other  
clinical findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless 
otherwise stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study drug (probable, possible) should be followed 
until the event is resolved or the Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer clinically  
significant.  AEs considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until 
Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF must be complete d with as much 
information as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When 
new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the 
electronic SAE  eCRF should be updated within [ADDRESS_879817] was an  outpatient a t the 
time of the SAE and was  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (e.g., 
admission report, laboratory test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be included 
as part of the subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been achieved. 
14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

In a medical  emergency  (i.e., an event  that requires immediate  attention  regarding the treatment  of 
a subject,  operation of the clinical  study,  and/or the  use of investigational drug),  study site staff 
will apply appropriate medical  intervention according to current  standards of care,  and contact  [CONTACT_76962]. 
14.1.4. Medical  Monitor and Emergency  Contact [CONTACT_7171] 
, MD 
In a study related medical emergency situation, when the assigned Medical Monitor cannot be 
reached 
by a caller, an on -call Physician can be reached 24 hours per day, 7 days per week via an 
 Call -Center:  
• Telephone:   
(this is a chargeab le telephone number allowing a global reach from both 
landlines and mobile phones) 
•  
On this internet page a list of country- spec ific toll-free telephone numbers is provided. It should be 
noted that not all countries globally have access to toll-free numbers as indicated on the “24/7 
Medical Help desk” index. Countries without toll-free numbers need to dial the chargeable number 
as indicated above. Furthermore, toll-free numbers are not available from mobile phones.  
14.1.5. SAE  Reporting  Contact [CONTACT_655620].  
14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to  promptly notify  the institution’s  IRB of all  seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
03 May 2017                                                                         80  Confidential  
 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will  review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring more frequently than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as  previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sp onsor will then  report  that information  
in an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis (if 
conducted) to determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the 
DSMB will have access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report any suspected  adverse reaction  to study 
treatment  that is both serious and  unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before  submitting  an 
IND safety  report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) 
suspected  adverse  reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE  does  not meet  all three of the  
definitions, it should not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the 
available information  and decide whether  there is  a reasonable possibility  that the drug  caused  the 
adverse  event  and, therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there is  a serious and  unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an  expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited reports  of an  increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unblinded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the 
safety of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_879820] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report 
any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threatening or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
03 May 2017                                                                         81  Confidential  
 additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_879821]. 
In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence associated  with  the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For  the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is  evidence  to suggest a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.   Suspected adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree  of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its  occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an  AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that,  had it occurred  in a more  severe form,  might 
have caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if,  in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -thr
eatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death,  be life -threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may  jeopardize 
the subject  and may  require medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed  
in this definition.  Examples  of such  medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring  
intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at  home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that  do not 
result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug  dependency or  drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
03 May 2017                                                                         82  Confidential  
 • If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure  or is  not listed  at the specificity  or 
severity  that has been  observed, or 
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with  the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan  or elsewhere in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this  definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655622])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and  cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,”  as used  in this definition, also  refers  to AEs  or suspected  adverse reactions  that are 
mentioned in  the Investigational Brochure  as occurring  with a class  of drugs  or as  anticipated  
from  the pharmacological  properties of the drug,  but are not specifically  mentioned as  occurring 
with the particular  drug  under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment in the study via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding .  The 
Investigator will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of 
unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unblinded; the medical monitor, study 
management team, and data management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation 
of an individual subject.  All cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way 
that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Q uality Assurance  
The Investigators  and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring,  audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as  requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original  medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance and  quality  control systems  with  written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to  ensure this  trial will be conducted and  data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange to  visit the Investigator at  regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring  visits  must be conducted according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to  ensure protocol adherence,  quality  of data,  drug  accountability,  compliance with  
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any 
discrepancies  or omissions will be identified  and resolved.  The  study monitor  will be given  access

verification.  
During and/or after  completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655623]-site audits.  The  Investigator  is 
expected  to cooperate with  any audit and  provide assistance and  documentation (including source 
data)  as requested.  
Quality  control will be applied to  each  stage  of data handling to ensure that  all data are reliable  
and have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by  [CONTACT_655624]/institution  and any other parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic  data)  used  in this protocol will be documented 
in a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each  study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the  
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  
Source documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s participation  in the 
study and should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, 
study procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , 
including survival. 
The Investigator  will main tain copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who  discontinue 
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and  the reason  for 
the discontinuation or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator  will maintain  all study records  according to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records will be retained  for at least  [ADDRESS_879822]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and  auditor(s) from  
the Sponsor or its  designee and  regulatory authority(ies) access  to the subject’s original medical  
records  for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The  
subject’s  confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available  to the extent  
permitted  by [CONTACT_655625]. 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics

 Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other information  about this  
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by  [CONTACT_655626].  The  Investigator agrees  to use this  
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  
the Sponsor.  It is understood that  there is  an obligation to  provide the Sponsor with  complete  data 
obtained during the study.  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be dis closed to regulatory authorities, 
other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required . 
15.4. Publication  Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_879823] of  the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment  by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive  written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to  implementation  at the 
investigative  site,  except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the  trial ( e.g., change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol 
change and  subsequently notify the regulatory  authorities and  the Investigative  sites  who  will 
notify the respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_879835] or seizure suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR).   Subjects will be administered one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_879836]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.   This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data .  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_879837] 12 
hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879838]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_879839] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW w ill have the same or a different third -line agent regimen 
re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be randomized to 
concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_879840] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and plac ebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject  was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_879841] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the sc hedule of assessments (Table 1 and Table 2) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis that would adequately 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pres sors that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_879846] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days; the 
exception to this i s that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_879847] been treated or randomized in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_879848] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the ti me of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879849] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study tre atment infusion 
and remains off third- line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 a nd placebo treated subjects in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655398]
w diagnoses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous w ean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and dur ation of response for 
those subjects are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects rand omized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V2 and the open-label study drug infusion at V10.  The weights at V2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), weight will also be  recorded 
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).   
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_879850] had a hysterectomy.  
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours  (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically signi ficant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc  intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_879851] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 
96, 120, 144, and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion; and, Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144,  and 192 hours after the start of the open -label 
(second) study drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h ECG, there is +/ - 2 hour time window for 
these ECGs.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second tape r step), +144 (immediately after stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately pr ior to the  end of the third taper step), +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open-label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution, peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] ( RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents,

 commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_879865] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_879866] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

 medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

 decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_879868].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone  concentration of approximately 1.67 
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;

 extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655406],  gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose.  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_879869]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_879870] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_879871] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (20%) subjects, appears to be lower than the published 
rates. None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.

 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_879872] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rat es in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_879873] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group;

 • Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effe cts and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_879874] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading  dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths, all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_879875] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale for adopting the higher dose reg imen as the open -label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_879876] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_879877] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879878] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_879879] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_879880]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluatio ns.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently

 comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in th e Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participatio n must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional  and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members,  
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a rest ricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a s ubject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety o f SAGE -[ADDRESS_879886]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the 
qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect med ication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_879887]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third -line agent at a dose sufficient to mainta in a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_879888] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratif ied by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and plac ebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the sub ject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_879889] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_879890] be 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind will 
be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who 
failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose. 
 
Figure  1: Study  Design  
 
7.2. Trial Conduct  
This study  will be conducted according  to the principles of the World Medical Association  
Declaration of Helsinki and most recent amendment, and in compliance with the protocol  approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), and in accordance with  ICH Guidelines on 
GCP standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization w ill be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and between the 
treatment groups (SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE- 547 will be administer ed on an open-label basis to subjects who meet 
the criteria for open -label treatment .

8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic re search; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss 
of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.   In ad dition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_879894]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879895] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

 10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_879902] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third -line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments  should 
be documented  throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R , as described below, 
and recorded  on the  eCRF.  For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third- line agents, procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information (to include the name 
[CONTACT_655711], third- line agent, procedure, and/or treatment, and the start and 
stop dates and times) from Visit 3 through Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For subsequent 
QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to include the name 
[CONTACT_655712] 3 through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_879903] “f ailed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.

All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt w ill be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be re corded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879904] -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another  purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the  start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequenc y of administration.  
11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy  
Success or failure will be determined , with success defined as weaning the subject off all third -line 
agents before completion of the first blinded infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879905] suppression during the 24 hours after 
the end of the blinded (first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879906] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity  (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents 
that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of  the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour

 • Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and nature of the third- line agent weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs in real time relate d to key study timepoints (terminal wean and the period after the end of the 
blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner  in order to 
provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that take place after 
the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough se izures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the thir d-line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_879907] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is  on two third- line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_879908]- line agent being weaned  should be

 adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_879909]- line agent  being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or startin g the open- label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administe red in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the  
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_879910] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are repr esentative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility  This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure  suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_879911] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_879912]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the b linded infusion to [ADDRESS_879913] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open- label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third- line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_879914] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 af ter starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_879915] or seizure  suppression because

 any seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus 
doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The E EG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infus ion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_879916].  In some cases (the TAEEG 
and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the 
different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWE EG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst or seizure  suppress ion during the qualifying wean  constitutes a failure ); 
the QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_879917] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success.  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655413] a nd the pattern seen 
on the EEG.

• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655415] a failure on the primary endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_879919] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hours following the 
end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
A maximum of nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst or seizure  suppression prior to the 
QW and during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655351]- response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity 
at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of 
more than two microvolts): 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the  CEEG and  QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are success ful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not administered the open- label study drug  will have the 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion 
collected an d stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded 
study drug infusion read; 
• Those subjects randomized who later undergo the open- label infusion will have the QWEEG, 
BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion and the 
TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG related to the open -label study drug infusion collected and 
stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug 
infusion read. 
All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the  CGI-Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879920] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physi cal illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_879921] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879924]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening 
procedures not considered standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry and GFR will be calculated at:  
• Visit 1 and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879925] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for ser um chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1 and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879926] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
For adults and children ≥ [ADDRESS_879927] es will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour 
medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879928] of care.   GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].   For children under 30 
kg, results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be sent to the 
central  laboratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for 
additional blood sampling for central laboratory testing.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential,  
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In additi on 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since  an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_879929] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879930] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879931]’s weight measured prior to dosing 
during V10.  
If it is not possible to obtain the actual weight at the above -referenced timepoints, permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol). In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_879932] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152,

+152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the open-label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used:  
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the blinded (first) study drug infusion

• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic Samples  
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a sample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distributio n, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extra ction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information withi n Sage Therapeutics or at 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeut ics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation  of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the  process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_879934] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography ta ndem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusio n), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper ste p), +132  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open- label SAGE -547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_879935] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_879936] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and 
metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations; experience with the p lasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879937] having two infusions of 
study dru g will be 99 ml (33 ml for children  weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879938] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a s ample to be retained frozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655418] 100 microlitres. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_879939] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions w ill be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this fa cility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?

14 February 2017                                         63  Confidential  
 • If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371]

(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], unsuitable home circumstances,  other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness  or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FO UR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all + /- 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)  
The GOS  is a relatively  common asses sment scale used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE.  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows a prediction of the long -term course of rehabilitation 
to return to work and everyday life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability  
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be ass essed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating (SRS) measures the level of supervision that a patient/subject receives from 
caregivers.  The SRS rates level of supervision on a 13- point ordinal scale that can optional ly be 
grouped into five ranked categories (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part -Time Supervision, 
Full-Time Indirect Supervision, and Full -Time Direct Supervision).  The SRS was designed to be 
rated by a clinician based on interviews with the subject and an informant who has observed at first hand the level of supervision received by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a one -step procedure 
in which the clinician assigns the rating that is closest to the subject's level.  Ratings are based on 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879940] immediately prior to the admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The m RS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_879941] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of  data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes .  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed 
description of t he interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879958] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_879959] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics

 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
seconda ry efficacy endpoints will use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thio pental  use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655423].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.

 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeuti cs to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistic al evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis Plan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug Subject s 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 a nd those initially receiving placebo.  
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessmen t of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_879960] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus P AEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879961] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted i n the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_879962] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health;

14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879964] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threaten ing or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_879965].  In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to 
IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threat ening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death.

 14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242664] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochu re is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblin d the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.  All

15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after comp letion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

 Number of Subjects  
The study will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites . 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting .  Pediatric patients (those < 14 years of age) will be managed 
in a pediatric intensive care setting.  
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_879980] or seizure suppression.  These subjects ar e unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_879981]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.   This wean is called the qualify ing wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data .  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_879982] or seizure suppression and will be

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879983]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_879984] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen 
re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be randomized to 
concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_879985] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within  eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The ra ndomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments ( SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_879986] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and  Table 2) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the  blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

Study Objectives  
Primary  objective: 
To determine the response to a 144-hour (6 day) continuous intravenous infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_879987] 24 hours  after the end of the SAGE -547 or placebo infusion  
(primary response). 
Secondary objectives : 
1. To compare between SAGE -[ADDRESS_879988] suppression up to Visit 
12; 
2. To compare between SAGE -[ADDRESS_879989] infusion of SAGE -547 or placebo; 
3. To compare between SAGE -547 and placebo t he time between meeting the secondary response 
endpoint, defined in (2) above, and the re -institution of any third -line agent for seizure or burst 
suppression up to Visit 12; 
4. To compare the change in the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI)  between SAGE -547 and 
placebo up to Visit 12; 
5. To determine the number of days after the end of the first infusion of study drug that the subject 
does not have status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], up to Visit 12 ;

 4. Children (subjects aged less than 1 7 years) with an encephalopathy due to a  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_655312].  
5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, but dialysis that would 
adequatel y remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure;  
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_879991] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_879992] been treated or randomized  in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjec ts may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_879993] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed d escription of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the tim e of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary E ndpoint  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_879994] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study trea tment infusion 
and remains off third- line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 a nd placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655398]
w diagnoses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous w ean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V2 and the open-label study drug infusion at V10.  The weights at V2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), weight will also be  recorded 
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).   
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_879995] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significan t abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).

blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts mu st be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_879996] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 
and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion ; and, Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 192 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study 
drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h ECG, there is +/- 2 hour time window for these ECGs.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the e nd of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of  the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon  
2011; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880010] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_880011] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_880012] treatment.  In this protocol, the term  “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE [ Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying d egrees  of mortality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655639]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880014].

Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scie ntific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonge
d epi[INVESTIGATOR_655336] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;

 extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655406],  gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed  Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing  open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EI NDs for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all s imilar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_880015]- line agents while being administered  SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose .  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_880016]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferli si and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_880017] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underl
ying etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_880018] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the published 
rates.  None of the deaths w ere considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.

 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying  disease states.   Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_880019] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the available third -line agents wou ld be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was  a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_880020] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group;

 • Placebo control is not  without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about  administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned fr om their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880021] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_880022] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average  plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880023] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was  completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_880024] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in gen etic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880025] commonl y reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balg ard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et  al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880026] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF

4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal  identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and

Pediatric patients (those < 14 years of age) will be managed in a pediatric intensive care setting.   
Figure [ADDRESS_880033]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This  wean is called the 
qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be followed 
for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880034]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third -line agent at a dose sufficient to ma intain a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880035] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratifie d by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subje ct off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_880036] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the  assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_880037] be 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind will 
be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who 
failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment,  and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE- 547 will be administered on an open-label basis to subjects who meet 
the criteria for open -label treatmen t.

8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawa l, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than  planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880042] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

 10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the  dosing schedule s in Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject  obtained within the eight -hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure at 
V2 and prior to dosing at V3.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the fir st 
infusion of study medication.

Those subjects that qualify for the open -label study drug will be administered SAGE -547 Injection  
according  to the dosing schedule in Table 6.  The dose will be administered on a µg /kg/h basis, and 
the subject’s weight measured prior to dosing during V10 will be used to calculate the doses.  These 
infusion rates will be applied to SAGE -547 treatment for the open- label second infusions of study 
medication.

 10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_880049] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third -line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments  should 
be documented  throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R , as described below,  
and recorded  on the  eCRF.   For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third-line agents,  procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information (to include the name 
[CONTACT_655711], third-line agent,  procedure, and/or treatment, and the start and 
stop dates and times) from Visit 3 through Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For subsequent 
QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to include the name 
[CONTACT_655717] s and indication only will be recorded from Visit 3 through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_880050] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after th e 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880051] -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the prefe rred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The invest igator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression , and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates  
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration. 
11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy  
Success or failure will be determined , with success defined as weaning the subject off all third -line 
agents before completion of the first blinded infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880052] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880053] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power a t the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be c onsidered as “failures” for the primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure  suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents 
that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst  suppression the first 12 hours of the blinded study 
drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour

 • Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will al ways be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clini cal Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints ( terminal wean  and the period after the end of the blinded 
study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order to provide 
advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be  undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third-
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other we ans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that take place after 
the TW for t he first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring  the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_880054] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration o f study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880055] -line agent being weaned should be

 adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880056] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 a nd should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later  than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a  new third -line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_880057] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seiz ure 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_880058] or seizure suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_880059]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_880060] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG ).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_880061] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects,

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880067] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_880068] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880071]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table  2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening  
procedures  not considered  standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880072] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for ser um  chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880073] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
For adults  and children > 30 kg , these samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour 
medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880074] of care.   GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].   For children  under 30 
kg, results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be sent to the 
central lab oratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for 
additional blood sampling for central laboratory testing.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whethe r the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cel l count with differential,  
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_880075] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and spec ific gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880076] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE -547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880077]’s weight measured prior to dosing during 
V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain an actual weight at the above -referenced time points , permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating using an e stablished local protocol). 
In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
 
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_880078] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours ; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152, 
+160, and +1 92 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +16 0, and +1 92 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used:  
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the open-label (second) study drug infusion 
It is not necessary to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 
+1h ECG, there is +/ - [ADDRESS_880079] has died, the

 As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacoge netic sampling, a b lood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may sug gest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extracti on and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within S age Therapeutics or at 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics ) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored

 in a secure environment with restricted access .  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_880080] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified ) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug:

(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open- label SAGE -547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_880081] samples taken

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU , 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution t hat the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitatio n center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12 or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informan t who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Sco ring is a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880086] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_880087] may be performed at any time within the specified 24-hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim a nalysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880104] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end  of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reason s for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880105] deviation, minimum and maximum  for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
20 September  2016                                                                        74  Confidential  
 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW.  
As requested by [CONTACT_655640], the primary endpoint will also be s ummarized by [CONTACT_655641][INVESTIGATOR_655436]/or concurrent medication use. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until 
all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.   Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence  will be summarized .

Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be reported in a report se parate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_880107] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each su bject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEE G versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655642] 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics

 pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The 
SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
 
 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880108] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame descr ibed below in Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_880109] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

 14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work  or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective  
action.

14.1.5. SAE  Reporting  Contact [CONTACT_655620].
 
14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and u nexpected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880111] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threatening or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_880112].  In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-T hreatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes:

20 September  2016                                                                        82  Confidential  
 • Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  unde r this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at imme diate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.

 15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or aft er completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880113]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be no tified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655643].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
15.4. Publication   Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_880114] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_880130] or seizure suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR)  already appointed by [CONTACT_655644]-being, and closest relatives .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents at a dose 
sufficient  to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880131]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880132] or seizure suppression and will be

line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880134] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -

be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880135] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the trea tment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing  all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_880136] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_880137] 2016                                         8  Confidential

exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_880147] been treated or randomized  in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880148] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis

will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have complete d the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.

and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be co nducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT populat ion.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with var iables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints  will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those s ubjects are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third -
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V2 and the open-label study drug infusion at V10.  The weights at V2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), w eight will also be recorded  
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).   
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_880156] had a hysterectomy.  
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as  adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_880157] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 
96, 120, 144, and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion; and, Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 192 hours after the start of the open-label 
(second) study drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h ECG, there is +/ - 2 hour time window for 
these ECGs.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open-label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  SRS at V1 will be a retrospective assessment of the supervision required by [CONTACT_655645][INVESTIGATOR_655438], and mRS at V1 will 
be a retrospective assessment of the disability and dependence of the subject immediately prior to admission that includes th e index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655438].  
o  Target for complete wean of all continuous IV third-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
p Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880158] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for open -label study drug  at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 
(V3R) and all applicable subsequent visits.  
r  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to fi rst-line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880174] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_880175] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_880176] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for S E [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880177] 2016                                        31  Confidential  
 medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880179] 2016                                        32  Confidential  
 decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880180].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880181] 2016                                        33  Confidential  
 extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655406],  gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose.  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_880182]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_880183] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying
 etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_880184] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the published 
rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880185] 2016                                        34  Confidential  
 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported  in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rat her to the underlying disease states.   Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_880186] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for  their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment 
guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historica l controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating t he use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that knowledge of the treatment group (SA GE-[ADDRESS_880187] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880188] 2016                                        35  Confidential  
 • Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary effica cy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880189] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety s ignals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_880190] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880191] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_880192] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880193] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880194] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_880195]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655646] a legally  authorized representative  (LAR)  already appointed by [CONTACT_655647]- being, and closest relatives.  According to Swedish Medicinal Products Act 
(Läkemedelslagen 1992:859), consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_655648]. Only patients with a previously appointed LAR by [CONTACT_655649] 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880196] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  comprehend the  
situation and consent during  the course of the study,  written informed consent or verbal assent  will 
be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR and 
closest relatives with a copy of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent 
form for subject participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_39722]’s dedicated study  monitor  or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic  Sub-
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR  and closest relatives  must 
sign and dat e a specific consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main 
study consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely 
given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study. 
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be  taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880203] or seizure  
suppression has been maintained for 24 hours, the thir d-line agent or agents will be weaned.  This 
wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW 
will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -
line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and 
will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880204]’s LAR  and closest relatives .  The subject 
will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or 
seizure suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880205] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be ra ndomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was al located to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_880206] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_880207] be 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind will 
be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who 
failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment,  and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynami c randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.

SAGE -547 previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re -
enroll).  
8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss 
of benefi t.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880212]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investigator may  withdr aw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:

 • Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

SAGE -[ADDRESS_880220] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_880221] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third -line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments  should 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880222] 2016                                    49  Confidential  
 be documented  throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R , as described below,  
and recorded  on the  eCRF.  For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third-line agents,  procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information (to include the name 
[CONTACT_655711], third-line agent,  procedure, and/or treatment, and the start and 
stop dates and times) from Visit 3 through Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For subsequent 
QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all c oncomitant medications collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to include the name 
[CONTACT_655712] 3 through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_880223] of drugs which are inhibitors/inducers of CYP2C9 (as well as CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 is provided in Appendix 7.  In the absence of formal drug -drug interaction 
studies of SAGE -547, Investigators should ensure that co -administration is performed with caution.  
10.5.1. Concomitant AEDs  
Subjects may enter the study on AEDs, and be administered AEDs during the study.  All of these 
must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655439], the route of  administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  In addition, 
details of the first- line and second -line agents used to treat the subject prior to consenting for the study 
will be recorded on the eCRF, noting at what point the subject wa s deemed to have “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates  and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (su ccessful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear  from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are ap propriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purpose s does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880224] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880225] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be suc cesses.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line age nts are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol , and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents 
that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performi ng 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs in real time related to key study timepoints (terminal wean and the period after the end of the 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880226] 2016                                    51  Confidential  
 blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was s uccessful ) in a timely manner  in order to 
provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than  one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents  that take place after 
the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as  far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_880227] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 aft er starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880228] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880229] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent,  the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthr ough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dos e that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_880230] -line agent being 
weaned sh ould be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points:  
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure  suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_880231] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_880232]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_880233] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_880234] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG wil l be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880235] or seizure  suppression because 
any seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus 
doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be o btained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infus ion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour [ADDRESS_880236] 2016                                    54  Confidential  
 treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880237].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records w ill overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record 
requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the stud y time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the thir d-line agent 
reinstituted for burst or seizure  suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); 
the QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_880238] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success.  
• For the BIEEG, the P I will note the date and time of the start of the EEG and the pattern seen 
on the EEG. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst or 
seizure suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655440] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880239] or seizure  suppression before the end of the SAGE -
547 infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655441] a failure on the primary 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880240] 2016                                    55  Confidential  
 endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880241] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hours following the 
end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst or seizure  suppression prior to the 
QW and during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655351]- response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity 
at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of 
more than two microvolts): 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the  CEEG and  QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not administered the open- label study drug  will have the 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion 
collected and stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded 
study drug infusion read; 
• Those subjects randomized who later undergo the open- label infusion will have the QWEEG, 
BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion and the 
TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG related to the open -label study drug infusion collected and 
stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug 
infusion read. 
All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880242] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_880243] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI-I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880248]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening  
procedures  not considered  standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880249] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880250] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will inc lude complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC ) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880251] 2016                                    58  Confidential  
 lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_880252] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880253] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1. Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will be used to calculate the infusion rates throughout the entire blinded t reatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open- label study drug, the infusion rates 
for the open -label infusion will be calculated using the subject’s weight measured prior to dosing 
during V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain the actual weight at the  above- referenced timepoints, permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol). In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_880254] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152,

11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR and closest relatives consent to pharmacogenetic sampling, a b lood sample for 
genetic research will be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through 
the exclusion of patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may 
be of specific interest for subseque nt genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken 
prior to treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880256] and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics)  
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequ encing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysi s, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_880257] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol

SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_880260] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving S AGE -[ADDRESS_880261] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880266] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880267] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880291] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all effica cy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attemp ts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or pr ogression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880292] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880293] 2016                                    73  Confidential  
 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differ ence between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re- institution  of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of 
days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.   There will be no adjustment for missing values.

 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data g enerated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropr iate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for thos e subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_880295] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP. 
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880296] is randomized in the study.   Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter.  
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_880297] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

 14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represente d a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].

14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safe ty data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880302] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threatening or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_880303].  In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threat ening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death.

 14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochu re is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the Investigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes  that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880305] that does not unblind the medical 
monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audit s, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these vi sits, eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after comp letion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.

 Number of Subjects  
The study will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites . 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_880328] or seizure suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one  or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_880329]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.   This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data.  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different thi rd-line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_880330] or seizure suppression and will be ran domized to

sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880332] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen 
re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be randomized to 
concomitant SA GE-[ADDRESS_880333] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_880334] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and  Table 2 ) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
befor e the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

Study Objectives  
Primary  objective: 
To determine the response to a 144-hour (6 day) continuous intravenous infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880335] 24 hours  after the end of the SAGE -547 or placebo infusion (primary 
response). 
Secondary objectives : 
1. To compare between SAGE -[ADDRESS_880336] suppression up to Visit 
12; 
2. To compare between SAGE -[ADDRESS_880337] infusion of SAGE -547 or placebo; 
3. To compare between SAGE -547 and placebo t he time between meeting the secondary response 
endpoint, defined in (2) above, and the re -institution of any third -line agent for seizure or burst 
suppression up to Visit 12; 
4. To compare the change in the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI)  between SAGE -547 and 
placebo up to Visit 12; 
5. To determine the number of days after the end of the first infusion of study drug that the subject 
does not have status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], up to Visit 12 ; 
6. To determine the number of days after the end of the first infusion of stud y drug that the subject 
does not have seizures (convulsive and non-convulsive) up to Visit 12 ; 
7. To determine the number of separate epi[INVESTIGATOR_655306] 12 ; 
8. To determine the proportion of subjects with a new diagnosis of epil epsy afte r Visit 11 . 
Safety objectives :

Inclusion  Criteria  
The following inclusion criteria must be met for individuals to be eligible for the trial.  
1. Subjects [ADDRESS_880339]: 
• Failed to respond to the administration of at least one first -line agent (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_655310]), according to institution standard of care, and; 
• Failed to respond to at least one second- line agent (e.g., phenytoin, fosphenytoin, valproate, 
phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control AED), according to institution standard of 
care, and ; 
• Not previously been administered a third- line agent but have been admitted to an intensive 
care unit with the intent of administering at least one third -line agent for at least 24 hours; or 
who have previously failed zero, one or more wean attempts from third -line agents and are 
now on continuous intravenous infusions of one or more third- line agent and in an EEG burst  
or seizure  suppression pattern; or who have previously failed one or more wean attempts from 
third -line agents and are now either not on a continuous intravenous infusion of at least one 
third -line agent or are on a continuous intravenous infusion of one or more third- line agent but 
not in an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern.  
Exclusion Criteria  
None of the following exclusion criteria can be met for individuals to be eligible for the trial.  
1. Subjects who are pregnant. 
2. Subjects with a known allergy to progesterone or allopregnanolone  or any excipi[INVESTIGATOR_655311] -
547.  
3. Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy  with highly malignant/malignant EEG 
features  (Westhall, Rosetti et al.  2016) . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880340]  any of the following : 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis that would adequately 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_880341] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_880342] been treated or randomized  in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re -enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880343] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_880344] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more) .  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880345] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first  secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary s tatistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without  status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially rec eiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% res ponse rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V2 and the open-label study drug infusion at V10.  The weights at V2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), weight will also be recorde d 
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).   
e  Serum  pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_880346] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abno rmalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R) , at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_880347] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144,

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880361] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_880362] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_880363] treatment.  In this protocol, the term  “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately  35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for S E [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655639]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880365].

Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;

network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed  Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing  open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all s imilar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_880366]- line agents while being administered  SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose .  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_880367]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferli si and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_880368] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying
 etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_880369] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the published 
rates.  None of the deaths w ere considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.

 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying  disease states.   Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_880370] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the available third -line agents wou ld be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was  a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_880371] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group;

 • Placebo control is not  without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about  administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned fr om their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880372] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_880373] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average  plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880374] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was  completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_880375] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in gen etic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880376] commonl y reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balg ard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et  al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880377] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities.

4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal  identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880384]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the 
qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be followed 
for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880385]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression or 
seizure pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880386] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patien ts, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] 
(H) [ADDRESS_880387] evidence of phys iologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment,  and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE- 547 will be administered on an open-label basis to subjects who meet 
the criteria for open -label treatmen t.

8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investigator may  withdr aw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:

blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_880399] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs,

 be documented  throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R , as described below,  
and recorded  on the  eCRF.   For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomita nt AEDs, pressors, third-line agents,  procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information (to include the name 
[CONTACT_655711], third-line agent,  procedure, and/or treatment, and the start and 
stop dates and times) from Visit 3 through Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected during the screening period (Visits 1 and 2 ) has been recorded, only minimal information, to include the name 
[CONTACT_655712] 3 through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_880400] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Th ird-Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt w ill be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after th e 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the prefe rred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol .

microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents  will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure  suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents 
that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints ( terminal wean  and the period after the end of the blinded

12 September  2016                                                                        51  Confidential  
 study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order to provide 
advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean o f the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that take place after 
the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrou gh seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the  third -line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_880403] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880404] -line a gent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880405] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the  open-label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of stud y drug or starting the open- label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or af ter starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agen t or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_880406] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs ) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_880407] or seizure suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW.   
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_880408]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_880409] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_880410] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is reco rded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or afte r starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label inf usion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880411] or seizure  suppression because 
any seiz ure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus 
doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24-hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at H our 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of in formation into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respecti vely.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880416] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_880417] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated

infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880422] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.   GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.

pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_880423] infusion of study drug.  Acceptable methods of birth 
control include: 
• Total abstinence (no sexual intercourse) 
• Hormonal contraceptives including birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], implantable, or injectabl e 
contraceptives  
• An intrauterine devices (IUD)  
• A barrier form of contraception such as a condom or occlusive cap with a spermicide 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880424] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE -547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the

• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1.  Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will be used to calculate the infusion rates throughout 
the entire blinded treatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open- label study drug, the infusion rates 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880425]’s weight measured prior to dosing 
during V10.   
If this is not poss ible to obtain an actual weight at the above -referenced time points, permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol). 
In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_880426] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours ; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152,

+152, +16 0, and +1 92 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used:  
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the blinded (first) study drug infusion

11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of s pecific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxyst eroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates fo r influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibili ty and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at 
any designated contract labor atory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880428] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  an d

(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +16 0 hours after the start of 
the open- label SAGE -547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible .  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_880429] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_880430] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and 
metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol® concentrations; experience with th e plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_880431] having two infusions of study drug will be 
99 ml (33 ml for subjects weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites o f SAGE -[ADDRESS_880432] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen for subsequent analysis of SAGE -547 concentrations.

Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Con centrations of SAGE -547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that

[IP_ADDRESS]. Phar macoeconomic Data  
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12 or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R?

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i
 s a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.

12 September  2016                                                                        64  Confidential  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880435] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purpose s.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed 
description of the inte rim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880452] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subject s will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weanin g.  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will  
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880453] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
12 September  2016                                                                        74  Confidential  
 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The compa rison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which  third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of sign ificance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a signif icant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints ( time to re -institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of 
days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopen tal use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
meth odology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.

 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary respons e and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics  will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_880454] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects ran domized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous thi rd-line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880455] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic S AE eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_880456] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was  
re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy  of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (e.g., admission report, 
laboratory test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be included as part of the 
subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects, this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective  
action.

as indicated above. Furthermore, toll-free numbers are not available from mobile phones.  
 
14.1.5. SAE  Reporting  Contact [CONTACT_655620].  
14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880458] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report 
any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threatening or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_880459]. 
In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout 
the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to 
IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threat ening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above

12 September  2016                                                                        82  Confidential  
 • Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study man agement team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.

 15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after comp letion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880460]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  t hat registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
15.4. Publication   Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_880461] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged  18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_880477] or seizure suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_880478]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.   This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately th ree weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data .  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_880479] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880481] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome

infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that t hey failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental us e (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatme nt groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing  all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_880483] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study

 a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis that would adequatel y 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure;  
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_880493] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Estab lished Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_880494] been treated or randomized  in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described abo ve, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880495] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purp oses.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_880496] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication  prior to the end of study treatment infusion  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880497] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication , 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain a ctivity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated f or the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups 
in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may  also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and second ary response and duration of response for 
those subjects are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratif ied by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V2 and the open-label study drug infusion at V10.  The weights at V2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), weight will also be recorded  
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).   
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_880503] had a hysterectomy.  
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and  the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum c hemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_880504] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 
96, 120, 144, and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion; and, Pre -dose an d at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 192 hours after the start of the open-label 
(second) study drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h ECG, there is +/ - 2 hour time  window for 
these ECGs.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintena nce 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second tape r step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintena nce infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step), +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open-label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will  be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  SRS at V1 will be a retrospective assessment of the supervision  required by [CONTACT_655645][INVESTIGATOR_655438], and mRS at V1 will 
be a retrospective assessment of the disability and dependence of the subject immediately prior to admission that includes the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655444].  
o  Target for complete wean of all continuous IV third-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
p Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880505] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for open -label study drug  at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 
(V3R) and all applicable subsequent visits.  
r  AEs will be collected from the time Informed C onsent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880520] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_880521] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_880522] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchang eably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximate ly 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for S E [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880523] 2016                                        31  Confidential  
 medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880525] 2016                                        32  Confidential  
 decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880526].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880527] 2016                                        33  Confidential  
 extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655406],  gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose .  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_880528]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_880529] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying
 etiologies of SE in the  547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_880530] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the publishe d 
rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880531] 2016                                        34  Confidential  
 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_880532] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the avail able third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment g uidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_880533] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880534] 2016                                        35  Confidential  
 • Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subject s who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880535] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_880536] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880537] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_880538] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of  subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880539] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880540] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_880541]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880542] 2016                                        37  Confidential  
 comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880549]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the 
qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be followed 
for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880550]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third -line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880551] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and  medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] 
(H) [ADDRESS_880552] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of asse ssments (Table 1, Table 2  and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_880553] be 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind will 
be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who 
failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment , and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynami c randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.

enroll).  
8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subjec t can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss 
of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and 
analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880558]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investig ator ma y withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:

 • Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related  to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed unt il resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_880569] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant T hird-Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line a gent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burs t or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880570] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880571] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination suffici ent to produce a burst or seizure suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents 
that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs in real time related to key study timepoints ( terminal wean and the period after the end of the 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880572] 2016                                    51  Confidential  
 blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was succ essful ) in a timely manner  in order to 
provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line a gents that take place after 
the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seiz ures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_880573] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 aft er starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880574] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880575] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent,  the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthr ough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dos e that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infu sion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_880576] -line agent being 
weaned sh ould be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points:  
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure  suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_880577] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_880578]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_880579] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent,  the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_880580] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880581] or seizure  suppression because 
any seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus 
doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study  
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour [ADDRESS_880582] 2016                                    54  Confidential  
 treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880583].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the 
EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date an d time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the  CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655448] t was a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst or seizure  suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); 
the QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_880584] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success.  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655348]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst or 
seizure suppression during the terminal wean).  
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880585] or seizure  suppression before the end of the SAGE -
547 infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880586] 2016                                    55  Confidential  
 endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880587] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hours following the 
end of t he SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst or seizure  suppression prior to the 
QW and during the first 12 hours  of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655351]- response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity 
at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of 
more than two microvolts): 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the  CEEG and  QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not administered the open- label study drug  will have the 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion 
collected and stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG rela ted to the blinded 
study drug infusion read; 
• Those subjects randomized who later undergo the open- label infusion will have the QWEEG, 
BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion and the 
TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG rela ted to the open- label study drug infusion collected and 
stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug 
infusion read. 
All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880588] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_880589] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880594]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening  
procedures  not considered  standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880595] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880596] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237] . 
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology an d Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet  count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880597] 2016                                    58  Confidential  
 lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged  [ADDRESS_880598] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880599] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1. Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will be used to calculate the infusion rates throughout the entire blinded treatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open- label study drug, the infusion rates 
for the open -label infusion will be calculated using the subject’s weight measured prior to dosing 
during V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain the actual weight at the above -referenced timepoints, permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol). In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_880600] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hour s; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152, 
+160, and +1 92 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +16 0, and +1 92 hours after the start of the open-label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used:  
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the open- label (second ) study drug infusion 
It is not necessary to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 
+1h ECG, there is +/ - [ADDRESS_880601] has died, the 
following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complicat ions of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that  may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject .

include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 ( 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as c andidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted fro m the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated co ntract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenoty pe Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_880603] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol
® concentrations.

The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_880605] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_880606] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any e ffect that

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following que stions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what  was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score w as >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], unsuitable home circumstances, other)?  
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infus ion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880611] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880612] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed 
description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880636] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their  initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880637] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880638] 2016                                    73  Confidential  
 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differ ence between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re- institution  of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of 
days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.   There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880639] 2016                                    74  Confidential  
 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data g enerated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropr iate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 a nd those initially receiving placebo.  
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessmen t of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_880640] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus P AEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880641] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the  time frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_880642] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

 14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health;

14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880647] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threaten ing or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_880648].  In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to 
IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threat ening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death.

 14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochu re is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study man agement team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All

15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after comp letion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 17 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement  
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_880676] or seizure suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered  one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_880677]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.   This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data.  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_880678] 12 
hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880680] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen

infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 bala nce across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_880682] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain ac tivity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2) .

None of the following exclusion criteria can be met for individuals to be eligible for the trial.  
1. Subjects who are pregnant. 
2. Subjects with a known allergy to progesterone or allopregnanolone or any excipi[INVESTIGATOR_655311] -
547.  
3. Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy  with highly malignant/malignant EEG 
features  (Westhall, Rosetti et al. 2016) . 
4. Subjects who have any of the following: 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880691] 2016                                         11  Confidential  
 a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis that would adequately 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant he patic failure;  
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_880692] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655450] [ADDRESS_880693] been treated or randomized  in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880694] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have complet ed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made  
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_880695] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication  prior to the end of study treatment infusion  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880696] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication , 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summa ry statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haen szel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous we an attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug  infusion at V2 and the open-label study drug infusion at V10.  The weights at V2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed), weight wi ll also be recorded  
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).   
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_880702] had a hysterectomy.  
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each i nfusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse  events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours  (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_880703] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 
96, 120, 144, and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion; and, Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 192 hours after the start of the open-label 
(second) study drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h ECG, there is +/ - 2 hour time window for

the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  SRS at V1 will be a retrospective assessment of the supervision required by [CONTACT_655650][INVESTIGATOR_655438], and mRS at V1 will 
be a retrospective assessment of the disability and dependence of the subject immediately prior to admission that includes the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655438].  
o  Target for complete wean of all continuous IV third-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
p Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880704] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for open -label study drug  at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 
(V3R) and all applicable subsequent visits.

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to fi rst-line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880719] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_880720] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_880721] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880722] 2016                                        31  Confidential  
 medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880724] 2016                                        32  Confidential  
 decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880725].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880726] 2016                                        33  Confidential  
 extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655406],  gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose.  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_880727]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_880728] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying
 etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_880729] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the published 
rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880730] 2016                                        34  Confidential  
 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported  in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rat her to the underlying disease states.   Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_880731] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for  their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment 
guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historica l controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating t he use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that knowledge of the treatment group (SA GE-[ADDRESS_880732] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880733] 2016                                        35  Confidential  
 • Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary effica cy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880734] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety s ignals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_880735] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880736] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_880737] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880738] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880739] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_880740]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880741] 2016                                        37  Confidential  
 comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATION AL PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880748]-line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880749]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered  one or more third -line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880750] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the  study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_880751] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_880752] be 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind will 
be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who 
failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment,  and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized  to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.

enroll).  
8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss 
of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, fo r inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and 
analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880757]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investig ator ma y withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880758] 2016                                    46  Confidential  
 • Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related  to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

full.  Refer to the Ph armacy  Manual for additional details. 
10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the  dosing schedule s in Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject  obtained within the eight -hour window that follows the declaration of the QW f ailure at 
V2 and prior to dosing at V3.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the fir st 
infusion of study medication.

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880765] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_880766] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third -line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments  should 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880767] 2016                                    49  Confidential  
 be docum ented  throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R , as described below,  
and recorded  on the  eCRF.  For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third-line agents,  procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information (to include the name 
[CONTACT_655711], third-line agent,  procedure, and/or treatment, and the start and 
stop dates and times) from Visit 3 throug h Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For subsequent 
QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected during the screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to include the name 
[CONTACT_655712] 3 through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_880768] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose th at constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitio ns) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such s edation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or fo r another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880769] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880770] 
evidence of ph ysiologic brain activity ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents 
that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about wean ing may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs in real time related to key study  timepoints (terminal wean and the period after the end of the 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880771] 2016                                    51  Confidential  
 blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner  in order to 
provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guida nce for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from th ird-line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that take place after 
the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_880772] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880773] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjuste d to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880774] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusio n of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third -line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over  [ADDRESS_880775] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresp onds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure  suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_880776] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_880777]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_880778] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third- line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_880779] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of  the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes pr ior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of th e taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880780] or seizure  suppression because 
any seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus 
doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the ta per of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be succes ses or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour [ADDRESS_880781] 2016                                    54  Confidential  
 treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880782].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts ar e taken to service the different EEG record 
requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CE EG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burs t or seizure  suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); 
the QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_880783] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success.  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655428]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to w ean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst or 
seizure suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655441] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880784] or seizure  suppression before the end of the SAGE -
547 infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655429] a failure on the primary 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880785] 2016                                    55  Confidential  
 endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880786] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hours following the 
end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst or seizure  suppression prior to the 
QW and during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655351]- response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity 
at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of 
more than two microvolts): 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the  CEEG and  QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not administered the open- label study drug  will have the 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug i nfusion 
collected and stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded 
study drug infusion read; 
• Those subjects randomized who later undergo the open- label infusion will have the QWEEG, 
BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blin ded study drug infusion and the 
TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG related to the open -label study drug infusion collected and 
stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug 
infusion read. 
All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880787] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_880788] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880793]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening  
procedures  not considered  standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880794] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880795] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will inc lude complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC ) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880796] 2016                                    58  Confidential  
 lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this s tudy, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_880797] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH, 
and specific  gravity.

• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height  
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1. Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will  be used to calculate the infusion rates throughout 
the entire blinded treatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open- label study drug, the infusion rates 
for the open -label infusion will be calculated using the subject’s weight measured prior to dosin g 
during V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain the actual weight at the above -referenced timepoints, permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating  using an established local protocol). 
In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_880799] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152, 
+160, and +1 92 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +16 0, and + 192 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used:  
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the open-label (second) study drug infusion 
It is not necessary to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 
+1h ECG, there is +/ - [ADDRESS_880800] has died, the 
following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic Sample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE  (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one gene tic sample be taken per subject . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880801] and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeut ics or at 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeutics) working wit h the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted access.  The establ ished link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis  
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum stora ge period of [ADDRESS_880802] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical  lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol
® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug:

• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from  the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_880804] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_880805] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880808] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)?  
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655451] e end of Visit 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the fol lowing time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12 or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880810] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_880811] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880835] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all effica cy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attemp ts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or pr ogression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880836] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880837] 2016                                    73  Confidential  
 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differ ence between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re- institution  of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of 
days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.   There will be no adjustment for missing values.

 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data g enerated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropr iate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for thos e subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and s econdary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An ana lysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_880839] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP. 
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detect ing a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880840] is randomized  in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Respon sibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments o r other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter.  
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_880841] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

 14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective

14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880846] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report 
any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threatening or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_880847].  
 In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to IEC(s)/IRBs as required  by [CONTACT_655621].  
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threat ening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death.

 14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochu re is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However,  if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator

15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investig ators  and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after comp letion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880850]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  t hat registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655643].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
15.4. Publication   Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_880851] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria  Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_880875] or seizure suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR).   Subjects will be administered one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_880876]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.   This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse 
event, and outcome data.  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_880877] 12 
hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_880881] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule o f assessments (Table 1 and Table 2) .

Exclusion Criteria  
None of the following exclusion criteria can be met for individuals to be eligible for the trial.  
1. Subjects who are pregnant. 
2. Subjects with a known allergy to progesterone or allopregnanolone  or any excipi[INVESTIGATOR_655311] -
547.  
3. Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy  with highly malignant/malignant EEG 
features  (Westhall, Rosetti et a l. 2016) . 
4. Subjects who have any of the following: 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880890] 2016                                         11  Confidential  
 a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis that would adequately 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_880891] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days; the 
exception to this is that partic ipation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_880892] been treated or randomized in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subj ects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_880893] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When  approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_880894] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication  prior to the end of study treatment in fusion 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880895] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication , 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The com parison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non -significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number  
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitan t 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third -
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution, peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] ( RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880918] 2016                                        30  Confidential  
 commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst  suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The 
goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function 
and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_880919] -line therapy .  
If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_880920] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual inc idence of approximately  35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for S E [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880921] 2016                                        31  Confidential  
 medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880923] 2016                                        32  Confidential  
 decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880924].

is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67 
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE-547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880925] 2016                                        33  Confidential  
 extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655406],  gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage  is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, thereby  
[CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of the start of 
seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly as possible.  
To prevent  the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that anesthesia  be 
initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses  designed  to induce EEG  suppression patterns  
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• an ongoing open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) may be eligible for a second open- label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose.  
Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_880926]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_880927] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_880928] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (20%) subjects, appears to be lower than the published 
rates. None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880929] 2016                                        34  Confidential  
 In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_880930] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rat es in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_880931] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880932] 2016                                        35  Confidential  
 • Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effe cts and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880933] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading  dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths, all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_880934] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale for adopting the higher dose reg imen as the open -label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880935] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_880936] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880937] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_880938] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluatio ns.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880940] 2016                                        37  Confidential  
 comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in th e Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participatio n must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional  and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members,  
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a rest ricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a s ubject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880947]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the 
qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be followed 
for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome 
data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at dos es intended to result in EEG burst or seizure  suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_880948]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third -line agent at a dose sufficient to mainta in a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_880949] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratif ied by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and plac ebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the sub ject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_880950] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_880951] be 
confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind will 
be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who 
failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial Conduct  
This study  will be conducted according  to the principles of the World Medical Association  
Declaration of Helsinki and most recent amendment, and in compliance with the protocol  approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), and in accordance with  ICH Guidelines on 
GCP standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization w ill be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and between the 
treatment groups (SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.

8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the  Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investigator may  withdr aw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880957] 2016                                    46  Confidential  
 • Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter.  
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_880964] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_880965] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QWS) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third -line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments  should 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880966] 2016                                    49  Confidential  
 be documented  throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R , as described below, 
and recorded  on the  eCRF.  For subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third- line agents, procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information (to include the  name 
[CONTACT_655711], third- line agent, procedure, and/or treatment, and the start and 
stop dates and times) from Visit 3 through Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For subsequent 
QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to include the name 
[CONTACT_655712] 3 through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_880967] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt w ill be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be re corded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol .

the end of the blinded (first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880969] 
evidence of physiologic  brain activity ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst or seizure suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first 12 hours of  the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and nature of the third- line agent weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs in real time relate d to key study timepoints (terminal wean and the period after the end of the 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880970] 2016                                    51  Confidential  
 blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner  in order to 
provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6- 24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the third-
line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The guidance also 
applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that take place after 
the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough se izures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the thir d-line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_880971] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is  on two third- line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880972]- line agent being weaned  should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_880973]- line agent  being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or startin g the open- label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administe red in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the  
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_880974] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are repr esentative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility  This EEG also aims to capture the burst or seizure  suppression pattern during the 
[ADDRESS_880975] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period 
prior to the QW. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_880976]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, and the decision that the QW is a 
success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the b linded infusion to [ADDRESS_880977] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open- label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third- line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_880978] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 af ter starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880979] or seizure  suppression because 
any seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus 
doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The E EG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour [ADDRESS_880980] 2016                                    54  Confidential  
 treatment or after starting the open -label infus ion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_880981].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  Th e PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst or seizure  suppression during the qualifying wean  constitutes a failure ); 
the QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_880982] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success.  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655348].  
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line a gent reinstituted for burst or 
seizure suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the prima ry 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880983] or seizure  suppression before the end of the SAGE -
547 infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655453] a failure on the primary

 endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_880985] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hours following the 
end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
A maximum of nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burs t or seizure  suppression prior to the 
QW and during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655351]- response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity 
at the end of the p rimary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of 
more than two microvolts): 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the  CEEG and  QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not administered the open- label study drug  will have the 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion 
collected and stored, and the BIEEG, QWE EG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded 
study drug infusion read; 
• Those subjects randomized who later undergo the open- label infusion will have the QWEEG, 
BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion and the 
TWEEG, TAEEG, an d PAEEG related to the open -label study drug infusion collected and 
stored, and the BIEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug 
infusion read. 
All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880986] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_880987] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880992]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening 
procedures not considered standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry and GFR will be calculated at:  
• Visit 1 and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880993] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for ser um chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1 and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880994] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.   GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell ( RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_880995] 2016                                    58  Confidential  
 lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_880996] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_880997] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1. Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will be used to calculate the infusion rates throughout 
the en tire blinded treatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open- label study drug, the infusion rates 
for the open -label infusion will be calculated using the subject’s weight measured prior to dosing 
during V10.  
If it is not possible to obtain the actual weight at the above -referenced timepoints, permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such as 
information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol). In addition, a daily  weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use of 
a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_880998] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152, 
+160, and +192 hours after the start of th e blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the open-label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used:  
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start of 
the open-label (second) study drug infusion 
It is not necessary to collect these ECGs with the PK samp les at these timepoints and, apart from the 
+1h ECG, there is +/ - [ADDRESS_880999] has died, the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate as possible cause of death will be collected, which will be further categorized as due to 
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of  qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic Samples  
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subseque nt genetic analysis).  If for any reason a sample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881000] and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics)  
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequ encing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysi s, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_881001] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performanc e liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol
® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug:

• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_881003] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_881004] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and 
metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol® concentrations; experience with the p lasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881005] having two infusions of study drug will be 
99 ml (33 ml for subjects wei ghing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881006] 2016                                    62  Confidential  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881007] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharma coeconomic Data  
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi [INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed durin g Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open -label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)  
The GOS  is a relatively  commo n assessment scale used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE.  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows a prediction of the long -term course of rehabilitation 
to return to work and everyday life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability  
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating (SRS) measures the level of supervision that a patient/subject receives from 
caregivers.  The SRS rates level of supervision on a 13- point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part -Time Supervision, 
Full-Time Indirect Supervision, and Full -Time Direct Supervision).  The SRS wa s designed to be 
rated by a clinician based on interviews with the subject and an informant who has observed at first 
hand the level of supervision received by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a one -step procedure 
in which the clinician assigns the rating that is closest to the subject's level.  Ratings are based on 
the level of supervision received, not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted to need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881009] immediately prior to the admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS 
will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881010] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881034] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attem pts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol viola tions or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics P opulation  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881035] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881036] 2016                                    73  Confidential  
 to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates w ill be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order  of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, t he 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be eva luated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a 
non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow- up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing v alues.

 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis Plan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic res earch will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are trea ted with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for tho se subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc  intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881038] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG ( main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881039] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identificatio n and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs , an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_881040] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work  or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective

14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of  the Investigator to promptly notify the institution’s  IRB of all seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881045] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threaten ing or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_881046].  In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to 
IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threat ening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881047] 2016                                    81  Confidential  
 14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242664] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochu re is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are not specifically  mentioned as occurring with the 
particular  drug under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblin d the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.  All 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881048] that does not unblind the medical 
monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after comp letion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]

Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  t hat registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data 
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, cor porate partners, or consultants, as required. 
15.4. Publication   Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_881050] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881075]  or seizure  suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent 
themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will 
be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or 
more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_881076]- line agent or 
agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, ep ilepsy status, adverse 
event, and outcome data .  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst  or seizure suppression and will be 
randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_881077] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

infusion commenced within eight hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to ac hieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, rel atives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_881081] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study

 4. Children (subjects aged less than 1 7 years) with an encephalopathy due to a  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_655312].  
5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason,  dialysis  that would adequately 
remove Captisol® is not planned; 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not relate d to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure;

state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than [ADDRESS_881090] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days; the 
exception to this is that participation in  the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_881091] been treated or randomized in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881092] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881093] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent  wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion 
and remains off  third -line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between gr oups 
in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will b
e evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found t here are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all subjects who at least initiated the infusion w ith blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for 
subjects initially rec eiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be 
presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% res ponse rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and prior to administration of the blinded study drug infusion at V 2 and the open-la bel study drug infusion at V 10.  The weights at V 2 and 
V10 will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of the blinded and open-label infusions respectively.  If easily obtained (such as via a scale-bed) , weight will also be recorded 
once during each subsequent 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_881099] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as  adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R  for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  For the first 50 subjects randomized in the study, ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the 
blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre-dose (V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) 
study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), at  0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals 
will be recorded, as well as any clinically significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to [ADDRESS_881100] ECG collected at the following timepoints: Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 
and 192 hours  after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion ; and, Pre -dose and at 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 , 144, and 192 hours after the star t of the open-label (second) study 
drug infusion.  It is not necessary for to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from the 1 h EC G, there is +/ - 2 hour time window for these ECGs.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open-label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step) , +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open-label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to a nd including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the  start of each infusion of study drug , and at

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655455]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than  five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte and metabolic  disturbances, anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is 
associated  with  substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655328], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution, peaking in  infants/ young children  and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  
that in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  
population, which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 
2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US  is generally  quoted to  be within  the range of 18/100,000 to  
61/100,000, based  on a 19 -year retrospective study in  [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota ( Hesdorffer, 
Logrosc ino et al. 1998)  and a 2- year prospective study in Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock 
et al. 1995) , respectively.   Two  studies from  Europe give annual incidences  of a similar  
magnitude, ranging  between  9.9/100,000 and  15.8/100,000 ( Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000; Knake, 
Rosenow et al. 2001) .  It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  
as 150,000 cases  of SE (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first -line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam ( Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012) , which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an 
IV anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic  acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; 
Shorvon 2011; Hocker
, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - 
line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leavi ng up to  approximately 70-80% of patients  who 
receive second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is

 patients  are immediately  admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a 
medically -induced  coma  to stop all seizure- related  activit y.  The drugs  used to induce coma are 
continuously-infused IV agents,  commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital, referred  to as 
third -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure that 
seizure and/or burst suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen 
on an EEG,  characterized  by [CONTACT_655598], informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   
The goal of burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore 
function and reset  to normal pre -seizure levels.

the administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these  
patients  treated  with AEDs  will respond to  the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , 
leaving  up to  28% of  the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   
Based  on the  previously- cited  estimated  incidence in  the US,  this means  that there are  up to  42,000 
incident cases  of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .

If the weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent 
is re-administered  or a different  third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in 
super- refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy,

do not generally  differentiate its  nature as  responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and  
two-third s of the RSE  patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker,

3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortalit y depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The  mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881119] 2016                                                               31                                                                       Confidential  
            
 The causes  of death  from  SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  
standard treatments.   Prognosis worsens and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. 
with SE that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) , and with longer 
duration of medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet 
medical  need  to improve upon the current  standard  of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors have outcomes ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) .  In 
all, it is  estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional 
outcome.

conditions, adding and changing  anti-seizure drugs,  and repeated  attempts  at weaning  from  IV 
anesthetic agents.  Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655599]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or unconsciousness 
(Shorvon 2011) .  
Currently,  there  are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The  
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol,  
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without

 controls ( Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is  optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents  is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requiring 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to  be most effective in  
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is  also associated  with the most toxic  adverse effect profile,  comprising  
decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] ( Claass en, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The  
ability  to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents  as quickly as possible is therefore  
paramount, and an adjunct  to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents 
and supports their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition to 
the therapeutic armamentarium .  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881122].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is  an endogenous, naturally  occurring neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS) ( Holzbauer, Birmingham e t 
al. 1985; Paul a
nd Purdy 1992; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent positive allosteric  modulator of both synaptic and  extra-synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection (allopregnanolone aqueous formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of pa tients in RSE who have not responded to standard treatment.  SAGE -547 
Injection is a solution of 5 mg/mL allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI),  USP 
and 250 mg/mL betadex  sulfobutyl-ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Wate r for 
Injection, USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 
1.67 mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective recruitment of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance 
occurring  in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the 
central  nervous system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  
types  of GABA  receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A 
receptors  are macromolecul ar proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  
specific binding sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators,  including barbiturates,  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.  GABA receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes 
significantly  to the normal termination  of a seizure  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is  
a positive allosteric  modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  s eizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing 
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to 
control as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift 
from  inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-
D-aspartic  acid  (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655336] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881123] that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes 
to the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed  during prolonged seizures ( Kapur and 
Macdonald 1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  
GABA A receptors;  extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting  in 
a putative mode of action  for SAGE -547 in  SRSE.  
Status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655337], gliosis,  and 
network reorganization.  The major  cause of cell death  in cerebral  damage is excito toxicity , which  
is initiated  by [CONTACT_655602]- activation,  causing  calcium  to flood the cell, 
thereby  [CONTACT_655603].   This process  is initiated  within  a few hours of 
the start of seizure activity,  and provides the medical  imperative  to terminate  SE as quickly 
as possible.  To prevent the consequences  of the excitotoxicity  cascade,  it is recommended  that 
anesthesia be  initiated  within  1-2 hours of onset of seizures  at doses designed to  induce EEG  
suppression patterns  (Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 developmen t program  includes: 
• a completed  Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled trial , Study 547-
SSE-301; 
• an ongoing  open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or 
placebo), during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the 
Phase [ADDRESS_881124]- line agents while being 
administered SAGE -547 (or placebo) may  be eligible for a second open-label infusion of SAGE-
547 at a higher dose.  Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_881125]  of care 
for SRSE,  a serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  
comprise 20 from  the ongoing Phase 2 trial (7 1% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 
subjects who received EIND  treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_572379],  without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or 
death  during therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_655651],  which  is in accord  with the 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881126] 2016                                                               34                                                                       Confidential  
            
 efficacy  assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (7 3%) 
subjects  with  SRSE  who  completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_881127] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_881128] received SAGE-547, 6 out of 30 (20%) subjects, appears to be lower than the published rates. None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE-547: brain tumor, 
organophosphate toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655338], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non-fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605]-547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects 
(20%) experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE-[ADDRESS_881129] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third-line agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881130]-line agents would be reserved for the 
active control arm; 
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the pr actical difficulties 
of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655339], mandating 
the use of prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in 
a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE-[ADDRESS_881131] of 
care alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive with weaning in the SAGE -547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is 
associated with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed 
in two ways: firstly all patients receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects 
who fail to be weaned from their third-line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of 
study drug will be administered open- label SAGE-[ADDRESS_881132] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two-thirds of subjects experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid 
conditions.  The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initia l 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881133] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end  of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose 
are 102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open-label infusion 
of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881134] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE-547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE-547 has been increased from 120  hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_881135] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures in men and women up to [ADDRESS_881136] commonly reported AEs  were sedation 
(recorded as  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild 
headache ( Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported 
(Navarro, Kaddouz et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007; Kask, 
Backstrom et al. 2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hed strom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the 
reduced consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously- reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also 
experienced SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE-547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 
subjects (10%) were cons idered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported 
in 30 subjects (20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE-547 – 
this is in the context of published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data 
suggest that  SAGE -[ADDRESS_881137] a high  risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and 
Shorvon 2010) .  The  subjects treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_881138]  (IRB)  where the

4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and  the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and  agreements  in this protocol and  in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and  
must also  conduct the study in accordance  with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent 
will be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any  testing  under this protocol not considered standard of c are, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the situation and consent during the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  
[CONTACT_45822].  The informed consent form (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, 
must follow the Protection of Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The  inform ed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated 
study monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study must be approved by [CONTACT_655607].  The  ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic co mponent of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components 
of the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject 
chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or L AR must sign and date 
a specific consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study 
consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given 
and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study 
independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881139] Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an indivi dual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881146]-line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is 
called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned during the QW will be 
followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and 
outcome data (see Table 3).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line 
agent regimen re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst or seizure suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_881147]’s LAR.  The subject will 
then be administered one or more third-line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst or seizure  
suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881148] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within eight  hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE-547 or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_881149] 2016                                                               42                                                                       Confidential  
            
 stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line 
agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists 
and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which t reatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents 
starting at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_881150] evidence of physiologic brain 
activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the 
primary endpoint assessment period as determined by [CONTACT_655609] a success.  
Details of the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, 
Table 2 and  Table 3). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re- institution of a third -line agent 
regimen before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_881151] be confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655652]-label infusion 
starting.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on 
SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered 
SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

Guidelines on GCP standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects  to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line 
agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization 
(minimiz ation algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and 
between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization 
process will be included in the SAP.   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE-547 
and placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, 
pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which 
treatment.

8.3. Selec tion and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or 
loss of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of 
the main study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion 
in genetic research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non-leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881158]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study drug discontinuation and/or subject withdrawal from the study must be 
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor imm ediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their  LAR  may  withdraw subjects from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The  Investigator  will al so withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to Visit 10 (or 10R) should complete the procedures scheduled for the day  of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day  of their 
withdrawal, including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality assessment  
from Visit 12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study after Visit 10/10R should undergo 
study procedures as outlined for Visit 12/12R on the day of their withdrawal.  In all cases, the 
reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal of subjects for any  reason should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study 
period. 
The investigator may  withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons: 
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in 
the exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE considered related to study drug  should be 
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator determines the event is  
no longer clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to 
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Terminat ion 
Sage  Therapeutics  may  terminate  this study or any  portion of the study at any time for safety  
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
subjects, administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of st udy termination,  Sage  
Therapeutics  will provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites  must 
promptly notify their IRB and initiate  withdrawal  procedures for participating  subjects.

 10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the dosing schedules in  Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject  obtained within the eight -hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure at 
V2 and prior to dosing at V3.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the fir st 
infusion of study medication.

 10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is  six 24-hour periods (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_881167] 50 qualifying wean 
success (QW S) subjects, detailed information on a ll concomitant medications  (concomitant AEDs, 
third-line agents, pressors, and other concomitant medications) , procedures, and treatments should 
be documented throughout the study from Screening  through Visit 12/12R, as described below, 
and recorded on the eCRF.  Fo r subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all 
concomitant AEDs, pressors, third -line agents,  procedures, and treatments collected during the 
screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recor ded, only minimal information  (to include the 
name [CONTACT_655711], third -line agent,  procedure, and/or t reatment , and the 
start and stop dates and times ) from Visit 3 th rough Visit 12 will be recorded in the eCRF.  For 
subsequent QWS subjects, after the detailed information on all concomitant medications collected 
during the screening period (Visits 1 and 2) has been recorded, only minimal information, to 
include the name [CONTACT_655712] 3 
through Visit 12.   
SAGE -547 has demonstrated inhibitory effects on  cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital that are primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 
should be closely monitored  during SAGE -[ADDRESS_881168] “failed 
first-line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the di agnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.  This recording of third-line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all w ean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third- line agent increased or fai led and this third-
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881169]- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to fa cilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support or for another purpose.  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for 
seizure or burst suppression, and use of these third-line agents for these other purposes does not 
constitute a wean failure under this protocol. 
10.5.3. Concomi tant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration. 
11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy  
Success or failure will be determined , with success defined as weaning the subject off all third -line 
agents before completion of the first blinded infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881170] suppression during the 24 hours after 
the end of the blinded (first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881171] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt during study treatment to wean off all 
third -line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as 
continuous intravenous infusions of pentobarbital/thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine 
at maintenance doses alone or in combination suffic ient to produce a burst or seizure  suppression 
pattern on the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these 
agents that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects 
are on lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the first [ADDRESS_881172] 2016                                                                         52  Confidential  
 • Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/h our 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and nature of the third- line agent weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints (terminal wean and the period after the end of the blinded 
study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order to provide 
advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines.  
The following guidance for weaning applies  to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the 
entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6-24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further 
optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean  (QW); the terminal we an (TW), which is the wean of the third-
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the 
third -line agen ts other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent .  The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that 
take place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open -label study 
drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot 
be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a 
dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third-line agent should be started to replace 
that third -line agent or be adm inistered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the 
subject of the wean attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying 
wean before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re-
instituted within that [ADDRESS_881173] may then be 
randomized in the study. 
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881174] 2016                                                                         53  Confidential  
 • If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881175] -
line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning 
attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• If the subject is on three third-line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881176]- line agent being weaned 
should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or af ter starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third-line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and 
should begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than 
H97 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-
label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot 
be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a 
dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third-line agent should be started to replace

subject of the wean attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547, but 
the TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881177] 2016                                                                         54  Confidential  
 • Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_881178]-line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG 
being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed from the time of consent (CEEG).  The 
intent is to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for 
the study for that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst or seizure  suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable 
pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst  or 
seizure suppression pattern during the [ADDRESS_881179] or seizure  suppression in the 24 hour period prior to the QW.   
• EEG will be performed to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_881180]- line agent(s) , the decision to 
re-institute a third -line agent(s) at doses intended to induce burst or seizure  suppression, 
and the decision that the QW is a success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_881181] 12 hours of blinded 
study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the final or terminal wean of third-line agent 
(TWEEG).  The TW is the wean of the final third-line agent during the blinded 
administration of  study drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was 
on one third-line agent, the TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third -line agents, the TW is the wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will 
start [ADDRESS_881182] 2016                                                                         55  Confidential  
 • EEG will be performed during the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE- 547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded 
for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary 
endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting 
the open-label infusion of SAGE-547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then 
continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-
547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881183] or seizure  suppression because any seizure activity seen 
during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of 
study treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547 and the ensuing 24-hour 
period, during which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the 
primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting 
the open-label infusion of SAGE-547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the 
blinded administration of study treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547, and 
then continue for the one hour after the end of the 24-hour assessment period (to Hour 
169 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the 
open-label infusion of SAGE-547).  The duration of the PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881184].  In some cases 
(the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken 
to service the different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de-identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG 
and the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated 
(CEEG, QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655345], as follows:

 • For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655346].  
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure or success 
on the qualifying wean (inability  to wean off the third- line agent or the third -line agent 
reinstitututed for burst or seizure suppression during the qualifying wean constitutes a 
failure) ; the QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_881186] line agents 
in order to confirm that the QW was a success . 
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655348].  
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst or seizure  suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655440] a failure on the 
primary endpoint (inability to wean off the third-line agent by [CONTACT_655613]-[ADDRESS_881187] or seizure  suppression before the 
end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary  endpoint (inability to wean off the third-line agent by [CONTACT_655613]-[ADDRESS_881188] or seizure  suppression in the 24 
hours following the end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
A maximum of nine EEG records for e ach subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst or seizure  suppression prior to the 
QW and during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [CONTACT_365580] r esponse

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to 
integrate several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition.  Both the 
CGI-Severity  (Question 1, CGI -S) and the CGI -Improvement (Question 2, CGI -I) employ  a 7-
point Likert scale measuring  severity  of the disease state in the subject and improvement, 
respectively.  All severity  assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881190] question on the scale will not be 
employed in this trial, and where the  scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in 
this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_881191] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be 
evaluated at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881195] of care and will be collected periodically  throughout the 
study according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed and prior to study- specific  screening 
procedures not considered standard of care, during subject preparation for SAGE-547 
administration and through Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs  will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) coding  system ( current version). See Section  [ADDRESS_881196] 2016                                                                         59  Confidential  
 11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry and GFR will be calculated at:  
• Visit 1 and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the s tart of 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881197] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel 
only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1 and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881198] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
For adults and children > 30 kg, t hese samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-
hour medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  For children 
under 30 kg , results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be 
sent to the central laboratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for additional blood sampling for central laboratory testing. 
Any out- of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment 
about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet coun t and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspar tate 
aminotransferase (AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium,  
chloride, creatine kinase,  lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and 
glucose.   In addition triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment 
of lipemia in pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_655614] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women 
may not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_881199] will be ineligible 
for study  participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, 
pH, and specific  gravity.   
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881200] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes ( +/-15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/- 30 minutes ) after 
the start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the start of the infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit 1.  Weight will also be obtained at V2, within the 
eight  hour window that follows the declaration of the QW failure and prior to the initiation of the 
blinded infusion loading dose at H0 of V3, and will be used to calculate the infusion rates 
throughout the entire blinded treatment course.  If a subject qualifies for open-label study drug, the  
infusion rates for the open- label infusion will be calculated using t he subject’s weight measured 
prior to dosing during V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain an actua l weight at the above- referenced time points , permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such 
as information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol).   
In addition, a d aily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use 
of a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
For the first [ADDRESS_881201] be 
performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours ; at other times 
the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, 
+152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, 
+144, +152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the open-label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.  
For the subsequent subjects randomized in the study, the following timepoints for ECG will be used: 
• pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start 
of the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881202] 2016                                                                         61  Confidential  
 • pre-dose and at +1 +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, and +192 hours after the start 
of the open-label (second) study drug infusion 
It is not necessary to collect these ECGs with the PK samples at these timepoints and, apart from 
the +1h ECG, there is +/ - [ADDRESS_881203] has died, 
the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate as possible cause of death will be collected, which will be further categorized as due to 
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying caus e of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic Samples  
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a b lood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reaso n a sample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE-547.  Specific genetic variations of interest include but are not limited to : classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra-
family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g.  GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes 
associated with the production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE-[ADDRESS_881204] 2016                                                                         62  Confidential  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharm acogenetics)  
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific 
analysis.  No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person 
(internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify 
relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, 
allow regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of b eing analyzed.  Primary 
blood samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses 
are possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_881205] awals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE-547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol
® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the fol lowing time points 
relative to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose) , +3, +6, 
+12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (im mediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136 (immediately 
prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655366]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion.

 • All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples from the first 50 subjects randomized will also be analyzed for plasma 
concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The  allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/ - 5 minutes; subsequent samples, +/- [ADDRESS_881207] samples taken as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE-[ADDRESS_881208] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations; experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples a re analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881209] having two 
infusions of study drug will be 99 ml (33 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 w ill be calculated where appropriate (e.g., C
max, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881210] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of

Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE-547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881211] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit [ADDRESS_881212] 2016                                                                         64  Confidential  
 death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the sub ject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation 
center, a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 
10/10R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
other)?  
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epil epticus.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24 , +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after 
the start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)  
The GOS is a relatively  common assessment scale used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE.  It was first 
used in 1975 ( Jennett and Bond 1975)  and allows a prediction of the long- term course of 
rehabilitation to return to work and everyday life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups: 
• Death  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881213] 2016                                                                         65  Confidential  
 • Persistent vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability  
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating (SRS) measures the level of supervision that a patient/subject receives 
from caregivers.  The SRS rates level of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally 
be grouped into five ranked categories (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part- Time 
Supervision, Full-Time Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time Direct Supervision).  The SRS was designed to be rated by a clinician based on interviews with the subject and an informant who has 
observed at first hand the level of supervision received by [CONTACT_423] ( Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a 
one-step procedure in which the clinician assigns the rating that is closest to the subject's level.  
Ratings are based on the level of supervision received, not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted to need. 
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881214] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mR S-9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is  a commonly used scale to  determine  disability  and 
functional dependence due to  neurological  insult such  as stroke in adults.  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) 
denotes functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to  severe disa bility  (5) and death  (6).  The  
Modified Rankin Scale – 9Q is  a shortened version  consisting of 9 questions that  reliably  
determines  the mRS  score and  was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the 
rater base to  non- medically  trained  personnel ( Patel,  Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -
based  tool in  the public domain with  automatic  score calculation  and error  checking  found at 
www.modifiedrankin.com. 
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_881215] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor 
will be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical 
adjustment will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of th e study.  
A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter. 
13.1.2. Study Populations  
The Safety Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded study 
medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to actual treatment.  This analysis 
population will be used for all safety analyses.   
The Intent to  Treat Population is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classifie d according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881241] secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the 
cause of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non-completion of the infusion or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655617] .  Acceptable reasons for 
defining a subject as MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of 
the underlying cause of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will exclude 
data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be classified 
according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to 
examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of 
blinded SAGE- [ADDRESS_881242] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of res ponse to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) 
between SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT 
population using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, 
conco mitant pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and 
its associated p -value will be presented. T he comparison of treatment response rates will be 
conducted at the 5% level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will 
also be conducted.   
An additional analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third-line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post-
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881243] 2016                                                                         75  Confidential  
 13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE-547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoint s will use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section 
(Section  6 ).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, 
the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue 
until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant result.  The 
analysis of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from baseline in CGI, 
secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655375]) will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for 
treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  
Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be 
performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too 
many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655460] E Status  
Diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655461].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during r ecurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details  of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or  a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the 
samples.   Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component 
of the study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis Plan will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881244] 2016                                                                         76  Confidential  
 13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE-547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -respon ders/non-responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881245] on QT/ QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to ex ploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE-547 treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects randomized to SAGE-547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment 
groups at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).   
 
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  
The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes 
to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
14. ADVERSE  EVENTS 
The s afety procedures in this study will be detailed in a Safety Management Plan, which will be 
agreed and signed before the first subject is randomized in the study.  Section  14.[ADDRESS_881246] 2016                                                                         77  Confidential  
 Section  14.2 su mmarizes  Sponsor/Medical Monitor Responsibilities  regarding monitoring of AE  
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Iden tification and Documentation of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R.  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of s creening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after  completion of s creening  will be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from study personnel will be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Form.  Any  clinically  significant  deterioration in laboratory assessments or other  
clinical finding s are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless 
otherwise stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study drug (probable, possible) should be followed 
until the event is resolved or the Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer clinically  
significant.  AEs considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until 
Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an  electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF must be completed with as much  
information as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When 
new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the 
electronic SAE  eCRF should be updated within [ADDRESS_881247] was an  outpatient at the 
time of the SAE and was  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (e.g., 
admission report, laboratory test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be included

All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved. 
14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to  Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_655653]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

(up to and including the last s tudy visit) must be reported  by [CONTACT_655619]  [ADDRESS_881250] 
include an  assessment  of whether  there  is a reasonable possibility  that the drug  caused  the event.  
In a medical  emergency  (i.e., an  event  that requires immediate  attention  regarding the treatment  of 
a subject,  operation of the clinical  study,  and/or the  use of investigational drug),  study site staff 
will apply appropriate medical  intervention according to current  standards of care,  and contact  [CONTACT_76962]. 
14.1.4. Medical  Monitor and Emergency  Contact [CONTACT_7171] 
, MD 
In a study related medical emergency situation, when the assigned Medical Monitor cannot be 
reached 
by a caller, an on -call Physician can be reached 24 hours per day, 7 days per week via an 
 Call -Center:  
• Telephone:   
(this is a chargeable telephone number allowing a global reach from both 
landlines and mobile phones) 
•  
On this internet page a list of c ountry- s pecific toll-free telephone numbers is provided. It should be 
noted that not all countries globally have access to toll-free numbers as indicated on the “24/7 Medical Help desk” index. Countries without toll- free numbers need to dial the chargeable number 
as indicated above. Furthermore, toll-free numbers are not available from mobile phones.  
14.1.5. SAE  Reporting  Contact [CONTACT_655620].
 
14.1.6. Reporting  to Institutional  Review  Boards (IRBs)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to  promptly notify  the institution’s  IRB of all  seriou s and 
unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881251] 2016                                                                         80  Confidential  
 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will  review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring more frequently than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as  previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then  report  that information  
in an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring fun ction the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report any suspected  adverse reacti on to  study 
treatment  that is both serious and  unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before  submitting  an 
IND safety  report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) 
suspected  adverse  reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE  does  not meet  all three of the  
definitions, it should not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the 
available information  and decide whether  there is  a reasonable possibility  that the drug  caused  the 
adverse  event  and, therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there is  a serious and  un expected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an  expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited reports  of an  increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unblinded prior to reporting to FD A.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the 
safety of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_881252] to expedited reporting in the EU. The Sponsor or its designee, will report 
any single S[LOCATION_003]R to the appropriate National CAs and IECs within 7 days if the S[LOCATION_003]R is life -
threatening or fatal (with the relevant follow -up information subsequently communicated within an 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881253] 2016                                                                         81  Confidential  
 additional eight days), and within [ADDRESS_881254]. 
In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the sponsor will submit, once a year throughout 
the clinical trial, a safety report to competent authorities of the concerned Member States and to IEC(s)/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_655621]. 
14.3. Adverse  Event  Definitions 
14.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical  occurrence associated  with  the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For  the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is  evidence  to suggest a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.   Suspected adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree  of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its  occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an  AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that,  had it occurred  in a more  severe form,  might 
have caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if,  in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -th
reatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medic al events  that may  not result  in death,  be life -threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may  jeopardize 
the subject  and may  require medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed  
in this definition.  Examples  of such  medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring  
intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at  home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that  do not 
result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or th e development of drug  dependency or  drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881255] 2016                                                                         82  Confidential  
 • If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure  or is  not listed  at the specificity  or 
severity  that has been  observed, or 
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with  the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan  or elsewhere in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this  definition, hepatic necrosis wou ld be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655622])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and  cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,”  as used  in this definition, also  refers  to AEs  or suspected  adverse reactions  that are 
mentioned in  the Investigational Brochure  as occurring  with a class  of drugs  or as  anticipated  
from  the pharmacological  properties of the drug,  but are not specifically  mentioned as  occurring 
with the particular  drug  under investigation. 
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the stu dy subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment in the study via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of 
unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unblinded; the medical monitor, study 
management team, and data management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.  All cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented i n a way 
that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.
 
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators  and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring,  audits, I RB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as  requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original  medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance and  quality  control systems  with  written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to  ensure this  trial will be conducted and  data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange to  visit the Investigator at  regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring  visits  must be conducted accordi ng to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to  ensure protocol adherence,  quality  of data,  drug  accountability,  compliance with  
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other  data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any 
discrepancies  or omissions will be identified  and resolved.  The  study monitor  will be given  access  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881256] 2016                                                                         83  Confidential  
 to study- relevant  source documents (including medical  records)  for purposes of source data 
verificat ion. 
During and/or after  completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655623]-site audits.  The  Investigator  is 
expected  to cooperate with  any audit and  provide assistance and  documentation  (including source 
data)  as requested.  
Quality  control will be applied to  each  stage  of data handling to ensure that  all data are reliable  
and have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by  [CONTACT_655624]/institution  and any other parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic  data)  used  in this protocol will be documented 
in a Data Manage ment  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each  study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the  
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  
Source documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s participation  in the 
study and should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, 
study procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status, 
including survival. 
The Investigator  will ma intain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who  discontinue 
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and  the reason  for 
the discontinuation or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator  will maintain  all study records  according to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records will be retained  for at least  [ADDRESS_881257]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and  auditor(s) from  
the Sponsor or its  designee and  regulatory authority(ies) access to  the subject’s original medical  
records  for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The  
subject’s  confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available  to the extent  
permitted  by [CONTACT_941] a pplicable  laws  and regulations. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881258] 2016                                                                         84  Confidential  
 Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other information  about this  
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  inform ation  of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by  [CONTACT_655626].  The  Investigator agrees  to use this  
information  to accomplis h the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  
the Sponsor.  It is understood that  there is  an obligation to  provide the Sponsor with  complete  data 
obtained during the study.  The information obtained from the clinical study will b e used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, 
other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required . 
15.4. Publication   Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_881259] of  the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment  by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive  written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to  implementation  at the 
investigative  site,  except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the  trial ( e.g., change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol 
change and  subsequently notify the regulatory  authorities and  the Investigative  sites  who  will 
notify the respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and being 
managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement  
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881280] suppression .  
These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the study due to coma or mental incapacity from 
the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   
Subjects will be administered one or more third- line agents at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression 
pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881281]-line agent or 
agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned 
will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adve rse event, and outcome 
data.  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re-instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_881282]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third-line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881283] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and outcome data (see Table 3
).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -
line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to 
                                                 
1 In this study, the term Super -Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655305] “Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (RSE) that has failed 
standard treatment” and the two terms are used interchangeably.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881284] be randomized and the blinded study drug infusion 
commenced within six hours of the investigat or’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE-547 or placebo in a 1 :1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to SAGE-
547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595] /thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factor s and between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE-547 and placebo) being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and  monitors will not be able 
to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) 
[ADDRESS_881285] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study medication infusion, and 
concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity as determined by [CONTACT_66594].  Details of the assessments and time points 
are provided in the schedule of assessments (Table  1 and Table  2). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re- institution of a third -line agent regimen before the 
end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE- 547 at a dose higher than that administered in the blinded part 
of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be e ligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose. 
Visit Schedule  
The visit schedule and a n overview of events at each visit is provided in  Table  1, Table  2 and Table 3  Schedule of 
Assessments .

547 previously (i.e., subjects may not have received study drug/placebo  and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, subjects will 
also need to provide specific info rmed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -
leukocyte -depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881294] had a previous allogenic bone marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_655655]-estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept uninformed of the 
response rates at the time of the inter im analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made to the level of significance 
for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included 
in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The an alysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_881295] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third -line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion and 
remains off third -line agents for at least 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study medication, and who 
has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594].  The analysis will b e based on the ITT 
Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of significance.  
Analysis of Secondary E fficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared between 
SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level 
of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of endpoints as listed in the 
Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first 
secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yield s a non- significant result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the 
MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from 
Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655375]) will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, 
concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of prev ious wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re- institution of third -line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without 
status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with var iables for 
treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there 
are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment . 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are treated with a higher dose of SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be derived for subjects 
initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary statistics will be presented  for 
subjects who were QW successes.

 Sample S ize 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE-547 treatment and a 
35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, with 70 
subjects randomized to SAGE-547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90 % power for 
detecting a significant difference between groups at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_655591] /thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third -line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than  five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte and metabolic  disturbances, anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is 
associated  with  substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655328], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution, peaking in  infants/ young children  and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  
that in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  
population, which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 
2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE  in the US  is generally  quoted to  be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to  
61/100,000, based  on a 19 -year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, 
Logroscino et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study  in Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock 
et al. 1995 ), respectively.   Two  studies  from  Europe give  annual incidences of a similar  magnitude,  
ranging between  9.9/100,000 and  15.8/100,000 ( Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000; Knake, Rosenow et 
al. 2001) .  It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there  are as many  as 150,000 
cases  of SE (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first -line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam ( Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012) , which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an 
IV anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; 
Shorvon 2011; Hocker
, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - 
line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to  approximately 70-80% of patients  who 
receive second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is 
diagnosed as  having refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] ( RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to 
terminate  the seizure activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE

 patients  are immediately  admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a 
medically -induced  coma  to stop all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs  used to induce coma are 
continuously-infused IV agents,  commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital, referred  to as 
third -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  
the administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these  
patients  treated  with AEDs  will respond to  the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , 
leaving  up to  28% of  the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   
Based  on the  previously- cited  estimated  incidence in  the US,  this means  that there are  up to  42,000 
incident cases  of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_881310] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent is re-
administered  or a different  third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_881311] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “SRSE ” and the two may be used 
interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655330], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used  for SE  
do not generally  differentiate its  nature as  responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and  
two-third s of the RSE  patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013 ).  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655331]- refractory .  A 
recent review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE [ Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor
 tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The  mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.

22 April 2016                                                                30                                                                       Confidential  
            
 The causes  of death  from  SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous, resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  
standard treatments.   Prognosis worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer  duration of SE, i.e. 
with SE that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) , and with longer duration 
of medically -induced  coma ( Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012 ).  There is an obvious unmet  medical  
need  to improve upon the current  standard  of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011 ).  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) .  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional  
outcome.

conditions, adding and changing  anti-seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning  from  IV 
anesthetic agents.  Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or unconsciousness 
(Shorvon 2011) .  
Currently,  there  are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The  
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without

 controls ( Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is  optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents  is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requiring 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to  be most effective in  
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is  also associated  with the most toxic  adverse effect  profile,  comprising  
decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] ( Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The  
ability  to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents  as quickly as possible is therefore  
paramount, and an adjunct  to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents 
and supports their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition to 
the therapeutic armamentarium .  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881313].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is  an endogenous, naturally  occurring neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS) ( Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985; Paul a
nd Purdy 1992; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent positive allosteric  modulator of both synaptic and  extra-synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection (allopregnanolone aqueous formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE who have not responded to standard treatment.  SAGE -547 
Injection is a solution of 5 mg/mL allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI),  USP 
and 250 mg/mL betadex  sulfobutyl-ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for 
Injection, USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 
1.67 mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective recruitment of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance 
occurring  in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the 
central  nervous system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  
types  of GABA  receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A 
receptors  are macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  
specific binding sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators,  including barbiturates,  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic agents.  GABA receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes 
significantly  to the normal termination  of a seizure  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is  
a positive allosteric  modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  s eizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing 
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to 
control as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift 
from  inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-
D-aspartic  acid  (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655336] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881314] that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes 
to the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed  during prolonged seizures ( Kapur and 
Macdonald 1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  
GABA A receptors;  extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting  in 
a putative mode of action  for SAGE -[ADDRESS_881315] 
suppression ( Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• a completed  Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled trial , Study 547-
SSE-301; 
• an ongoing  open- label,  expanded access  protocol, Study  547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or 
placebo), during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the 
Phase [ADDRESS_881316]- line agents while being 
administered SAGE -547 (or placebo) may  be eligible for a second open-label infusion of SAGE-
547 at a higher dose.  Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_881317]  of care 
for SRSE,  a serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  
comprise 20 from  the ongoing Phase 2 trial (7 1% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 
subjects who received EIND  treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_572379],  without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or 
death  during therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_655658], which  is in accord  with the

 efficacy  assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (7 3%) 
subjects  with  SRSE  who  completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_881318] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_881319] received SAGE-547, 6 out of 30 (20%) subjects, appears to be lower than the published rates. None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE-547: brain tumor, 
organophosphate toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655338], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non-fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these 
events to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects 
(20%) experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE-[ADDRESS_881320] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rat es in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third-line agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881321]-line agents would be reserved for the 
active control arm; 
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655339], mandating 
the use of prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in 
a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE-[ADDRESS_881322] of 
care alone) would alter the beh avior of the investigators such that they could be more 
aggressive with weaning in the SAGE -547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effe cts and is 
associated with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed 
in two ways: firstly all patients receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects 
who fail to be weaned from their third-line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of 
study drug will be administered open- label SAGE -[ADDRESS_881323] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety  signals although two -thirds of 
subjects experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid 
conditions.  The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful 
treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_881324] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenanc e dose 
are 102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open-label infusion 
of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881325] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE-547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE-547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_881326] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional. 
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for 
exposures in men and women up to [ADDRESS_881327] commonly reported AEs  were sedation 
(recorded as  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655467]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild 
headache ( Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reporte d 
(Navarro, Kaddouz et al. 2003; Timby, Balg ard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007; Kask, 
Backstrom et al. 2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the 
reduced consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously- reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts 
(20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the 
context of published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These  preliminary  data suggest that

Shorvon 2010) .  The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_881329]  (IRB)  where the  
study is conducted. The  IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part  
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and  the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and  agreements  in this protocol and  in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and  
must also  conduct the study in accordance  with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent 
will be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any  testing  under this protocol not considered standard of care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the situation and consent during the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  
[CONTACT_45822].  The informed consent form (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, 
must follow the Protection of Hu man Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The  informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated 
study monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study must be approved by  [CONTACT_655607].  The  ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic compo nent of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components 
of the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject 
chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and date 
a specific consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study 
consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given 
and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study 
independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881330] Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to s ubjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individua l’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881336]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean 
(QW), and subjects who are successfully w eaned during the QW will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third- line agent regimen 
re-instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to 
concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881337]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third-line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression 
pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881338] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line 
agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE-547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents 
starting at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans 
by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_881339] evidence of phys iologic brain 
activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the 
primary endpoint assessment period as determined by [CONTACT_655609] a success.  
Details of the assessments and time points are provided  in the schedule of assessments (Table 1, 
Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re- institution of a third -line agent 
regimen before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_881340] be confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]-label infusion 
starting.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on 
SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo may all subsequently be eligible to be administered 
SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.3. Blinding and Randomiz ation  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line 
agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization 
(minimization algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification factors and 
between the treatment groups (SAGE-547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization 
process will be included in the SAP.   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 
and placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, 
pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which 
treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open -label basis to subjects who meet 
the criteria for open -label treatment.

recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their  LAR  may  withdraw subjects from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The  Investigator  will also  withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to Visit 10 (or 10R) should complete the procedures scheduled for the day  of study drug taper ( Hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day  of their 
withdrawal, including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality assessment  
from Visit 12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study after Visit 10/10R should undergo 
study procedures as outlined for Visit 12/12R on the day  of their withdrawal.  In all cases, the 
reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study 
period. 
The investig ator may  withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in 
the exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE considered related  to study drug  should be 
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator determines the event is  
no longer clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to 
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may  terminate  this study or any  portion of the study at any time for safety  
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
subjects, administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage  
Therapeutics  will provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites  must 
promptly notify their IRB and initiate  withdrawal  procedures for participating  subjects.

 10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the dosing schedules in  Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject  obtained within the six -hour window that follows the declaration of the QW fai lure at 
V2 and prior to dosing at V3.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the fir st 
infusion of study medication.

 10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is  six 24-hour periods (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_881351] may  be given at the discretion of the 
Investigator at  any time during  the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be documented throughout the study from Screening  through Visit 12/12R and 
recorded on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated inhibitory effects on  cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital that are primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 
should be closely monitored  during SAGE -[ADDRESS_881352] “failed 
first-line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.  This recording of third-line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt w ill be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be re corded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third-line agent increased or failed and this third-
line agent stopped and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being use d as 
ventilator support or for another purpose.  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar use s are usually much lower than those used for 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881353] suppression during the 24 hours after 
the end of the blinded (first) infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881354] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt during study treatment to wean off all 
third -line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as 
continuous intravenous infusions of pentobarbital/thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine 
at maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on 
the EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that 
may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on 
lower doses than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_881355] 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen 
failures /protocol violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and nature of the third- line agent weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881356].  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end 
of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order 
to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines.  
The following guidance for weaning applies  to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  Continued determined efforts to liberate subjects from sedation must be undertaken for the entire duration of the blinded study drug infusion.  Each failed wean from third -line agents should 
be followed by a 6-24 hour period of suppression and then another wean attempt, with further optimization of the AED regimen.  
Weans include the qualifying wean  (QW); the termin al wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -
line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line agent if the 
subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans of the 
third -line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent .  The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third- line agents that 
take place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study 
drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot 
be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a 
dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third-line agent should be started to replace 
that third -line agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the 
subject of the wean attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying 
wean before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re-
instituted within that [ADDRESS_881357] may then be 
randomized in the study. 
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881358] ivity abates.  
• If the subject is on three third-line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881359]- line agent being weaned 
should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of 
study drug or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third-line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and 
should begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW 
should id eally begin as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than 
H97 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-
label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot 
be managed in this way, the third- line agent being wean ed should be re- instituted at a 
dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third-line agent should be started to replace this third -line agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the 
subject of the wean attempt.  
• Every effort mu st be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547, but 
the TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or afte r starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_881360]- line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being used to support key investigator decisions wi ll be collected at the following time points:

 • A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed from the time of consent (CEEG).  The 
intent is to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for 
the study for that patient; patterns would  be seizure activity for the first path to 
eligibility, burst suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for 
the third path to eligibility.   This EEG also aims to capture the burst suppression pattern 
during the [ADDRESS_881361] suppression prior to 
the QW.   
• EEG will be performed to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_881362]- line agent(s) , the decision to 
re-institute a third -line agent(s) at doses intended to induce burst suppression, and the 
decision that the QW is a success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_881363] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed to cover the final or terminal wean of third-line agent 
(TWEEG).  The TW is the wean of the f inal third -line agent during the blinded 
administration of study drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third-line agent, the TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three 
third -line agents, the TW is the wean o f the third and final agent.  EEG recording will 
start [ADDRESS_881364] suppression 
because any seizure activity co uld not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs.  
• EEG will be performed during the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE- 547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded 
for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting 
the open-label infusion of SAGE-547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then 
continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-
547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881365] suppression because any seizure activity seen during the 
taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.

 • EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of 
study treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547 and the ensuing 24-hour 
period, during which the primary endpoint is assess ed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is 
recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at 
Hour 143.5 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting 
the open-label infusion of SAGE-547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the 
blinded administration of study treatment or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547, and 
then continue for the one hour after the end of the 24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open-label infusion of SAGE-547).  The duration of the PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881366].   In some cases 
(the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de-identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG 
and the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated 
(CEEG, QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655345], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655346].  
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success 
on the qualifying wean  (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent

A maximum of nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst suppression prior to the QW and 
during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470]-
response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the 
end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG powe r at the end of Visit 9 of more 
than two microvolts):

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to 
integrate several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the 
CGI-Severity  (Question 1, CGI -S) and the CGI -Improvement ( Question 2, CGI -I) employ  a 7-

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881374] of care and will be collected periodically  throughout the 
study according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed and prior to study- specific  screening 
procedures not considered standard of care, during subject preparation for SAGE-547 administration and through Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs  will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) coding  system ( current version). See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry and GFR will be calculated at:  
• Visit 1 and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881375] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel 
only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1 and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881376] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
22 April 2016                                                                          58  Confidential  
 For adults and children > 30 kg, t hese samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-
hour medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol 
as part of normal standard of care.   GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  For childre n 
under 30 kg , results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be 
sent to the central laboratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for additional blood sampling for central labor atory testing.  
Any out- of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment 
about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention and will be rec orded as adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calciu m, 
chloride, creatine kinase,  lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and 
glucose.   In addition triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment 
of lipemia in pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_655614] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women 
may not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_881377] will be ineligible 
for study  participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH, and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE-[ADDRESS_881378] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/-15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/- 30 minutes ) after 
the start o f the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the start 
of the infusion. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881379]’s weight measured 
prior to dosing during V10.   
If it is not possible to obtain an actual weight at the above- referenced time points , permission from 
the Clinical Monitor must be obtained to use another method to obtain the subject’s weight (such 
as information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol).   
In addition, a daily weight will be obtained and recorded if this is easily obtained, such as the use 
of a scale bed.  
11.2.5. ECG  
12-lead ECGs should be performed at Visit [ADDRESS_881380] be performed within 15 minutes prior to the collection of PK samples up to 160 hours ; at other times the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, 
+152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, 
+144, +152, +160, and +192 hours after the start of the open-label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.  
11.2.6. Mortality

the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate as possible cause of death will be collected, which will be further categorized as due to one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity ex isting at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma;

 • other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic Samples  
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a b lood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a sample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE-547.  Specific genetic variations of interest include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes ( e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra-
family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes 
associated with the production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE-547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE-547 is being evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or 
at any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  No personal details sufficient for  individual identification will be available to any person 
(internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify 
relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, 
allow r egulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary 
blood samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_881382] visit has been 
reached, or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent.

 11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE-547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points 
relative to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose) , +3, +6, 
+12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128 (immediately pr ior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately 
prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655366]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose) , +3, +6, 
+12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +126 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately 
prior to the end of the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the 
third taper step ), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and 
+160 hours after the start of the open- label SAGE -547 study drug infusion. 
• All sampl es will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol
®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/ - 5 minutes; subsequent samples, +/- [ADDRESS_881383] samples taken as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE- [ADDRESS_881384] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations; experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881385] having two 
infusions of study drug will be 99 ml (33 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e. g., C
max, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881386] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained

Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE-547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881387] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation 
center, a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 
10/10R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
other )? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371]

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern).  
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after 
the start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)  
The GOS is a relatively  common assessment scale used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE.  It was first 
used in 1975 ( Jennett and Bond 1975)  and allows a prediction of the long- term course of 
rehabilitation to return to work and everyday life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups: 
• Death  
• Persistent vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability  
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating (SRS) measures the level of supervision that a patient/subject receives 
from caregivers.  The SRS rates level of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally 
be grouped into five ranked categories (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part- Time 
Supervision, Full-Time Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time Direct Supervision).  The SRS was designed to be rated by a clinician based on interviews with the subject and an informant who has 
observed at first hand the level of supervision received by [CONTACT_423] ( Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a 
one-step procedure in which the clinici an assigns the rating that is closest to the subject's level.  
Ratings are based on the level of supervision received, not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted to need. 
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881388] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407].

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is  a commonly used scale to  determine  disability  and 
functional dependence due to  neurological  insult such  as stroke in adults.  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) 
denotes functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to  severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The  
Modified Rankin Scale – 9Q is  a shortened version  consisting of 9 questions that  reliably  
determines  the mRS  score and  was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the 
rater base to  non- medically  trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -
based  tool in  the public domain with  automatic  score calculation  and error  checking  found at 
www.modifiedrankin.com. 
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_881389] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor 
will be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical 
adjustment will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  
A detailed descriptio n of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter. 
13.1.2. Study Populations  
The Safety Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded study 
medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to actual treatment.  This analysis 
population will be used for all safety analyses.   
The Intent to  Treat Population is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subj ects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not co ntrolled. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881400] secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the 
cause of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non-completion of the 
infusion or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655617] .  Acceptable reasons for 
defining a subject as MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of 
the underlying cause of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of 
disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of 
blinded SAGE- [ADDRESS_881401] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analy sis of Primary Endpoint  
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section  11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) 
between SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT 
population using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, 
concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prio r to randomization (one vs two  or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and 
its associated p -value will be presented. T he comparison of treatment response rates will be 
conducted at the 5% level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will 
also be conducted.   
An additional analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third-line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post-randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW.

 13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be com pared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section 
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, 
the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue 
until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant result.  The 
analysis of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from baseline in CGI, 
secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655375]) will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for 
treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thio pental  use and number of previous wean attempts.  
Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be 
performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too 
many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for miss ing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a s ecured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component 
of the study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be 
obtained to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis Plan will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any geneti c 
research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.

 13.1.11. Open -Label Study Drug  Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are  treated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non-responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881402] on QT/ QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The nine EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE-547 treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects randomized to SAGE-547 and 70 su bjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment 
groups at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).   
 
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  
The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.    Any deviations from or changes 
to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
14. ADVERSE  EVENTS 
The safety procedures in this study will be detailed in a Safety Management Plan, which will be 
agreed and signed before the first subject is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the iden tification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs  for relationship  to study drug and  severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical Monitor Responsibilities  regarding monitoring of AE  
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.

 Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify AEs during the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R.  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of s creening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after  completion of s creening  will be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic procedures, or spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from study personnel will be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Form.  Any  clinically  significant  deterioration in laboratory assessments or other  
clinical findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless 
otherwise stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study drug (probable, possible) should be followed until the event is resolved or the Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer clinically  
significant.  AEs considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until 
Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF must be completed with as much  
information as possible and subm itted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When 
new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the 
electronic SAE  eCRF should be updated within [ADDRESS_881403] was an  outpatient a t the 
time of the SAE and was  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (e.g., 
admission report, laboratory test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be included 
as part of the subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been achieved. 
14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will  review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring more frequently than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as  previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then  report  that information  
in an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be described in a separate DSMB Charter.  

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881406] report  in an IND safety  report any suspected  adverse reaction  to study 
treatment  that is both serious and  unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before  submitting  an 
IND safety  report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) 
suspected  adverse  reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE  does  not meet  all three of the  
definitions, it should not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the 
available information  and decide whether  there is  a reasonable possibility  that the drug  caused  the 
adverse  event  and, therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there is  a serious and  unexpected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an  expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited reports  of an  increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unblinded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the 
safety of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_881407] medical  occurrence associated  with  the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered  drug  related.  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For  the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is  evidence  to suggest a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.   Suspected adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree  of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its  occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an  AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that,  had it occurred  in a more  severe form,  might 
have caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if,  in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
22 April 2016                                                                          79  Confidential  
 • A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death,  be life -threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may  jeopardize 
the subject  and may  require medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed  
in this definition.  Examples  of such  medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring  
intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at  home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that  do not 
result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug  dependency or  drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure  or is  not listed  at the specificity  or 
severity  that has been  observed, or 
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with  the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan  or elsewhere in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under th is definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655622])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and  cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as  used in this definition, also  refers  to AEs  or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in  the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with a class  of drugs  or as  anticipated  from  
the pharmacological  properties  of the drug, but are  not specifically  mentioned as  occurring  with 
the particular  drug under investigation.  
14.4. Emergency  Identification  of Study  Medication  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety of the study subject, the I nvestigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject ’s treatment in the study via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes  that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding w ill ensure that only the investigator is un blinded; the medical monitor, study 
management team, and data management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.  All cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.

 15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators  and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring,  audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as  requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original  medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance and  quality  control systems  with  written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to  ensure this  trial will be conducted and  data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange to  visit the Investigator at  regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring  visits  must be conducted according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to  ensure protocol adherence,  quality  of data,  drug  accountability,  compliance with  
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any 
discrepancies  or omissions will be identified  and resolved.  The  study monitor  will be given  access  
to study- relevant  source documents (including medical  records)  for purposes of source data 
verification.  
During and/or after  comple tion of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655623]-site audits.  The  Investigator  is 
expected  to cooperate with  any audit and  provide assistance and  documentation (including source 
data)  as requested.  
Quality  control will be applied to  each  stage  of data handling to ensure that  all data are reliable  
and have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by  [CONTACT_655624]/institution  and any other parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic  data)  used  in this protocol will be documented 
in a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each  study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the  
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  
Source documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s participation  in the 
study and should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, 
study procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , 
including survival. 
The Investigator will  maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who  discontinue 
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and  the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881408]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and  auditor(s) from  
the Sponsor or its  designee and  regulatory authority(ies) access  to the subject’s original medical  
records  for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The  
subject’s  confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available  to the extent  
permitted  by [CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other information  about this  
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly availabl e trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by  [CONTACT_655626].  The  Investigator agrees  to use this  
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  
the Sponsor.  It is understood that  there is  an obligation to  provide the Sponsor with  complete  data 
obtained during the study.  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, 
other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required . 
15.4. Publication  Policy  
All information  concerning SAGE -[ADDRESS_881409] of  the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment  by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive  written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to  implementation  at the 
investigative  site,  except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the  trial (eg , change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol 
change and  subsequently notify the regulatory  authorities and  the Investigative  sites  who  will 
notify the respective IRB,  as appropriate.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE  Sage Therapeutics  
  
The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting .  Pediatric patients (those < 14 years of age) will be managed 
in a pediatric intensive care setting.  
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881421] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consen t themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881422]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully wean ed will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG  burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881423] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug. 
1 In this study, the term Super -Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655305] “Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (RSE) that has failed 
standard treatment” and the two terms are used interchangeably.  
[ADDRESS_881424]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to main tain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881425] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881426] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be ra ndomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more ).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_881427] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and Error! Not a 
valid result for table. ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the  blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

4. Children (subjects aged less than 1 7 years) with an encephalopathy due to a  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_655312].  
5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned or non-
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 d ays; 
e.  a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. 
6. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_881432] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_881433] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial em ploying SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to p rovide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881434] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study r eport. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
[ADDRESS_881435] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no)  and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion 
and remains off third- line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between  SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant  
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655475]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institutio n of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of  previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
powe r for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (o ne vs two  or more).

d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and once during each 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).  
Daily weight will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of each dose.  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_881436] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study  
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Bloo d samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out-of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the blinded (first) study drug infusion: Pre -dose 
(V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152 , 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), 
at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc  intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to 160 hours.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at  the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:  For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately  prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours afte r the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately  prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately pr ior to the end of the third taper step), +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  Modified Rankin Score (mRS) applicable for subjects ≥[ADDRESS_881437]-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
q Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved I V administration bags and lines.  
r  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881438] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects  who become eligible for re -treatment at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
s  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
t  Subjects may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the CRF with details including date and time of 
starting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  Details of the f irst-line and second-line agents used to tre at the subject prior 
to consenting for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
u All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and , after consent,  
the doses with start/stop times for each change in dose.  This record ing of third -line agents will continue throughout the study until Visit 12/12R.

3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon  
2011; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents,

commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_881448] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_881449] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE [ Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acu
te mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881451].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scien tific Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive allosteric  
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonge
d epi[INVESTIGATOR_655336] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
[ADDRESS_881452] suppression 
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Phase 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_881453]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_881454] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the  547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_881455] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the publishe d

rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_881456] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents wou ld be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was  a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_881457] of care

alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not  without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about  administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned fr om their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881458] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  A t these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70%  successful treatment 
outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_881459] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma co ncentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881460] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed  after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_881461] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in ge netic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_881462] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects (20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data sugge st that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881463] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
[ADDRESS_881465] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their 
decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic file s will remain physically separated.

7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -547 administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to subjects in SRSE .  
Pediatric patients (those < 14 years of age) will be managed in a pediatric intensive care setting.  
Figure [ADDRESS_881470]- line agent or agents 
will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a 
different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881471]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_881472] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which  treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_881473] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
asses sment period as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
[ADDRESS_881474] be confirmed in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose. 
 
Figure  1: Study  Design  
 
7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment , and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that pa tients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the prim ary endpoint wean.

8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in p harmacogenetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881478]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of t he mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
[ADDRESS_881479] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Invest igator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significa nt.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the  dosing schedule s in Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the first infusion of study 
medication .

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881485] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_881486]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demon strated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_881487] “f ailed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt w ill be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after th e 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol  is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
[ADDRESS_881488] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881489] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity ( avera ge EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the 
EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses 
than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_881490] 12 hours 
of the  blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators  
and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing  and nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end 
of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order 
to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
[ADDRESS_881491] -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
of the third- line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line 
agent if the subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line ag ent.  The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject o f the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_881492] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally  the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881493] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881494] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
TW Guidance  
• The T W is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blind ed 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be st arted to replace this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after  starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_881495] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of  consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG will capture as much as possible of the burst suppression pattern that 
precedes the QW.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_881496]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst suppression, and the decision that the QW is a success . 
04 February 2016                                                                         50  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_881497] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third a nd final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_881498] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administratio n of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after  
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881499] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the e nd of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will  be 25.[ADDRESS_881500].  In some cases (the TAEEG 
and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the 
different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG fil e will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655478] t the EEG 
shows, as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); the 
QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_881501] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success . 
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655428]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression duri ng the terminal wean).  
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent  by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881502] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881503] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst suppression prior to the QW and 
during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470] -
response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more 
than two microvolts ):

• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the CEEG and QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not retreated will have the BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion collected and stored, and the BIEEG,

and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion read. 
All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881504] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_881505] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881508]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
[ADDRESS_881509] preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881510] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881511] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
For adults  and children > 30 kg , these samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour 
medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part 
of normal standard of care.   GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].   For children  under 30 
kg, results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be sent to the 
central laboratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for additiona l blood sampling for central laboratory testing.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharma cokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_881512] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881513] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit [ADDRESS_881514]’s weight (such as information from the LAR or estimating using a n established  local protocol). 
11.2.5. ECG  
12-lead ECG s should be performed at Visit [ADDRESS_881515] be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK 
samples up to 160 hours ; at other times the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152, 
+160, and +1 92 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +16 0, and +1 92 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
11.2.6. Mortality  
Mortality will be recorded on the Visit [ADDRESS_881516] has died, the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ;

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes :  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subj ect population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability,  and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or g ene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA wi ll be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or a t 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA.  
04 February 2016                                                                         57  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_881517] visit has been reached, or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified ) and Captisol
® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immed iately after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified.  
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_881518] samples tak en 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_881519] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and 
metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol® concentrations;  experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881520] having two infusions of 
study dru g will be 99 ml (33 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., C
max, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK  
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881521] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655480], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655418] 100 microlitres. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect tha t 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881522] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions wi ll be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this fac ility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]:

• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at  Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects  into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Sco ring is a one -step procedure 
[ADDRESS_881523]'s  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881524]  immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_881525] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statist ical adjustment 
[ADDRESS_881536] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons fo r defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatmen t received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881537] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
04 February 2016                                                                         69  Confidential

13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous thir d-line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To c onfirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
As requested by [CONTACT_655640], the primary endpoint will also be summarized by [CONTACT_655641][INVESTIGATOR_655436]/or concurrent medication use. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until 
all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomi tant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non-parametric analysis may also be performed. 
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population.

13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report se parate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc  intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881539] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to

at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655595]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The 
SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the 
SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
 
 
[ADDRESS_881540] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic  SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_881541] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health;

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the D SMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious an d unexpected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded  prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
[ADDRESS_881544] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes  that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding w ill ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical 
monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conduc ted according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these vis its, eCRFs  and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_881545]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655661].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
[ADDRESS_881546] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE  Sage Therapeutics  
  
The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881558] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consen t themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR)  already appointed by [CONTACT_655662] -being, and 
closest relatives .   Subjec ts will be administered one or more third -line agents at a dose sufficient to 
maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881559] -line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean  is called the qualifying wean (QW), 
and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect 
medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data.  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -
instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst 
suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881560] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

standard treatment” and the two terms are used interchangeably.  
[ADDRESS_881561]’s LAR  and closest relatives .  The subject will then b e administered one or more third-
line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881562] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and 
outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent 
regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to 
concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881563] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be r andomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third -line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_881564] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are  provided in the schedule of assessments (Table 1 and Error! Not a 
valid result for table. ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be e ligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion 
and remains off third- line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594].  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MI TT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups 
in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may  also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and second ary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and once during each 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).  
Daily weight will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of each dose.  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_881575] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.

q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881576] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subj ects who become eligible for re-treatment at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
r  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
s  Subje cts may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the CRF with details including date and time of 
starting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of  administration.  Details of the first-line and second-line agents used to treat the subject prior 
to consenting for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
t All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and, after consent,

3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents,

commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_881587] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_881588] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual inc idence of approximate ly 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for S E [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortalit
y in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881590].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scienti fic Rat ionale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive allosteric  
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
[ADDRESS_881591] suppression 
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or place bo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Phase 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_881592]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_881593] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The

rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_881595] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents wou ld be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was  a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_881596] of care

alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not  without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about  administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned fr om their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881597] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  A t these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70%  successful treatment 
outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_881598] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma co ncentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881599] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed  after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_881600] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in ge netic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_881601] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects (20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data sugge st that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881602] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655646] a legally  authorized representative  (LAR)  already appointed by [CONTACT_941] C ourt for 
their well- being, and closest relatives .  A ccording to Swedish Medicinal Products Act

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE  Sage Therapeutics  
  
(Läkemedelslagen 1992:859), consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_655663]. Only patients with a previously appointed LAR by [CONTACT_655664], providing also the closest relatives  consent to the study . Written informed consent is required 
for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, including 
screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  comprehend the  
situation and consent during  the course of the study,  written informed consent or verbal assent  will 
be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain  consent and to provide the subject’s LAR and 
closest relatives  with a cop y of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent 
form for subject participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_39722]’s dedicated study  monitor  or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethic al and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR and closest relative s must 
sign and dat e a specific consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main 
study consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely 
given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study 
independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal f rom the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881608]-
line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects 
who are successfully weaned will be follow ed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have 
the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst 
suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881609]’s LAR  and closest relative s.  Th e subject will 
then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression 
pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881610] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects  to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study  will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_881611] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
[ADDRESS_881612] be confirmed in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose. 
 
Figure  1: Study  Design  
 
7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment , and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the primary endpoint wean.

8.2. Exclusion  Criteria 
None of the following exclusion criteria can be met for individuals to be eligible for the trial.  
1. Subjects who are pregnant. 
2. Subjects with a known allergy to progesterone or allopregnanolone. 
3. Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy. 
4. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis but for whatever reason, dialysis is not planned or

5. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or for 
whom the qualifying wean cannot be  completed  within [ADDRESS_881614] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; 
the exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655410] [ADDRESS_881615] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss 
of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from a ny aspect of the main 
study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a no n-leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881616]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investigator may  withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881622] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded pla cebo infusions.  
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_881623]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
[ADDRESS_881624] of drugs which are inhibitors /inducers  of CYP2C9  (as well as CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, CYP3A4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17) is provided in Appendix 7.  In the absence of 
formal drug -drug interaction studies of SAGE -547, Investigators should ensure that co-
administration is performed with caution. 
10.5.1. Concomitant AEDs  
Subjects may enter the study on AEDs, and be administered AEDs during the study.  All of these 
must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655439], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  In addition, details of the first- line and second -line agents used to treat the subject prior to consenting for the study 
will be recorded on the eCRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed secon d-line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents wi ll continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol ) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for th e 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol. 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications mus t be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration.

evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are  anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the 
EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be 
expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG bu rst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses 
than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_881627] 12 hours 
of the blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators  
and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with  experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints  (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end 
of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order 
to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The followin g guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
of the third- line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or  the wean of the last third -line 
agent if the subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance also applies  to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
[ADDRESS_881628] blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third- line agent being we aned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_881629] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881630] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt c ontinued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881631] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of t he last third -line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
[ADDRESS_881632] OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as so on as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_881633] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points:  
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the st udy for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.   This EEG will capture as much as possible of the burst suppression pattern that 
precedes the QW.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_881634]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst suppression, and the decision that the QW is a success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_881635] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the w ean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_881636] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of  study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881637] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881638].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the 
EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record 
requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655483], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655484]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655485] t hat supported the decision to determine that the subject was a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); the 
QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_881639] line agents in order to confirm that the QW was a success . 
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655348]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burs t 
suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655440] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third -line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881640] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655486] s upported any decision to determine that the subject was a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881641] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst suppression prior to the QW and 
during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470] -
response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more 
than two microvolts): 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the CEEG and QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored,  
or read;

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881642] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_881643] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881648] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for ser um chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881649] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.   GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
plate let count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT ), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in  serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_881650] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
[ADDRESS_881651] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion;

infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height  
Weight and height will be measured at V isit [ADDRESS_881652]’s weight (such as information from the LAR or estimating using a n established  local protocol). 
11.2.5. ECG  
12-lead ECG s should be performed at Visit [ADDRESS_881653] be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK 
samples up to 160 hours ; at other times the allowed time window for ECGs  is +/ - 2 hours:

+160, and +1 92 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +16 0, and +1 92 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
11.2.6. Mortality  
Mortality will be recorded on the Visit [ADDRESS_881654] has died, the 
following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes:

• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR and closest relative s consent to pharmacogenetic sampling, a b lood sample for 
genetic research will be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through 
the exclus ion of patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may 
be of specific interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken 
prior to treatment, a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that 
no more than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibi lity and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract lab oratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysi s: Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify r elevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
07 December  2015                                                                         57  Confidential

[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_881655] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the  maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be anal yzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_881656] samples taken as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_881657] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations; experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881658] having two infusions of study drug will be 
99 ml (33 ml for subjects weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881659] relative s will be asked if they would consent for a sample 
to be retained frozen for subsequent analysis of SAGE -547 concentrations.  The minimum volume 
of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655368] 100 microlitres. 
Full det ails of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881660] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation ce nter, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was t he subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R?

• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern).  
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hou rs (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12 or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i
 s a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881661] immediately prior to the admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407].

[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881662] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes .  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
[ADDRESS_881673] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subject s will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the inf usion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the unde rlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will  
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881674] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
07 December  2015                                                                         69  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The c omparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differ ence between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment,  concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” end points will only be summarized  by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized .

methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.    
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmac ogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and second ary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary  statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups.  
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881676] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed d escription of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_335545]

13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  
The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.    Any deviations from or changes 
to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.

Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE

14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health;

14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DS MB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.

14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect

the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
[ADDRESS_881681] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblin d the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.  All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.
 
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
07 December  2015                                                                         78  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_881682]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, cor porate partners, or consultants, as required. 
[ADDRESS_881683] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE  Sage Therapeutics  
  
Number of Subjects  
The study will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites . 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881700] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881701]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], advers e event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881702] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug. 
1 In this study, the term Super -Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655305] “Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (RSE) that has failed 
standard treatment” and the two terms are used interchangeably.  
[ADDRESS_881703]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881704] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse  event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881705] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dyn amic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_881706] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and  Table 2 ) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be e ligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned  or non -
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcom e is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 days; 
e.  a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. 
5. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_881712] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_881713] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881714] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducte d 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_881715] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more) .  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
[ADDRESS_881716] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study me dication , 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primar y endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT p opulation.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment . 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving  SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and once during each 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).  
Daily weight will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of eac h dose.  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_881717] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR  calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significa nt abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the blinded (first) study drug infusion : Pre -dose 
(V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), 
at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to 160 hours.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug

Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  SRS at V1 will be a retrospective assessment of the supervision required by [CONTACT_655645][INVESTIGATOR_655438], and mRS at V1 will 
be a retrospective assessment of the disability and dependence of the subject immediately prior to admission that includes th e index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655438].  
o  Target for complete wean of all continuous IV third-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
p Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV adminis tration bags and lines.  
q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881718] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for re -treatment at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
r  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the st art of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
s  Subjects may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the CRF with details including date and time of 
starting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  Details of the f irst-line and second-line agents used to treat the su bject prior 
to consenting for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
t All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and, after consent,  
the doses with start/stop times for each change in dose.  This record ing of third -line agents will continue throughout the study until Visit 12/12R.

3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit,  
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents,

commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_881728] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_881729] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortalit
y in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
21 March 2016                                                                                                               15  Confi dential

medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881731].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenousl y. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
[ADDRESS_881732] suppression 
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or place bo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Phase 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_881733]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],

rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_881736] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several  options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree whi ch of the available third- line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_881737] of care 
21 March 2016                                                                                                               15  Confi dential

alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE -547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is th erefore a potential ethical 
concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; second ly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881738] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regim en was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment 
outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_881739] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881740] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_881741] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_881742] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881743] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_881744]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
[ADDRESS_881745] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their 
decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881750]- line agent or agents 
will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a 
different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881751]’s LAR.  The s ubject will then be administered 
one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_881752] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to  be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all sub jects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_881753] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
[ADDRESS_881754] be confirmed in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose. 
 
Figure  1: Study  Design  
 
7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment,  and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the primary endpoint wean.

the exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655410] [ADDRESS_881757] bee n enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
8.3. Selection and Consent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmaco genetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss 
of benefit.  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.  In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte- depleted tran sfusion within [ADDRESS_881758]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investigator may  withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s req uest

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_881765]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures,  and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).

agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant T hird-Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean a ttempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dos e of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indicatio n for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not consti tute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration.

microvolts ) to be deemed  to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third-line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the 
EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be 
expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses 
than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_881769] 12 hours 
of the blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures /protocol violators  
and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end 
of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order 
to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of t hird-line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
of the third- line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line 
agent if the su bject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans f rom third line agents that take 
[ADDRESS_881770] blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_881771] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881772] -line a gent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881773] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the  open-label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of stud y drug or starting the open- label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
[ADDRESS_881774] OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or af ter starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agen t or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_881775] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate  the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.   This EEG will capture as much as possible of the burst suppression pattern that 
precedes the QW.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_881776]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst suppression, and the decision that the QW is a success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_881777] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
21 March  2016                                                                         50  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final t hird-line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_881778] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administratio n of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after  
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881779] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the e nd of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will  be 25.[ADDRESS_881780].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the 
EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record 
requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, th e date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655484]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655499] t he subject was a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); the 
QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_881781] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success . 
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655348]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For t he TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655440] a failure on the primary endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881782] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655429] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881783] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst suppression prior to the QW and 
during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655500] -
response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the 
end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more 
than two microvolts): 
• All subjects  will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the CEEG and QWEEG 
read;  
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
21 March  2016                                                                         52  Confidential

All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis.   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single r ating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881784] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physi cal illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_881785] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881790] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881791] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemis try samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_881792] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
[ADDRESS_881793] qualify

• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may sug gest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extra ction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information withi n Sage Therapeutics or at 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeut ics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted acc ess.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
21 March  2016                                                                         57  Confidential

[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_881797] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are id entified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immedia tely after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24,

(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immed iately after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified.  
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_881798] samples tak en 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_881799] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol

concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881800] having two infusions of study dru g will be 
99 ml (33 ml for subjects weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881801] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655368] 100 microlitres. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlat ion of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc  interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was t he subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R?

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern).  
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hou rs (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12 or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i
 s a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881803] immediately prior to the admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407].

[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modifi ed Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881804] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
[ADDRESS_881815] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analy sis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subject s will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the inf usion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the unde rlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will  
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881816] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
21 March  2016                                                                         69  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The c omparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differ ence between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re- institution  of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of 
days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be p lotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
[ADDRESS_881817] 
methodology for that questionnai re.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data gener ated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research compo nent of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate  and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary resp onse and duration of response 
for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881818] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the S AP. 
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo:  the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_335545]

pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  
The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_881819] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655666]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_881820] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective  
action.

14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  event s that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
[ADDRESS_881823] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approva l by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The I nvestigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.
 
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs ) 
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_881824]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
[ADDRESS_881825] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 Number of Subjects  
The study will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites . 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 18 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881837] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881838]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication , epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881839] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug.

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881840]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881841] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects w ho fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881842] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which s ubject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_881843] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments (Table 1 and  Table 2 ) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -
547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

 a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned  or non -
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 da ys; 
e.  a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. 
5. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_881849] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_881850] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to pr ovide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881851] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a deta iled description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at t he time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Pri mary Endpoint  
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_881852] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more) .  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881853] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Popula tion.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is  a significant difference between groups 
in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
resul t.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third-
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previ ous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects w ho at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summ aries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% r esponse rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_881854] had a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) rel ative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be r ecorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the blinded (first) study drug infusion: Pre -dose 
(V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), 
at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to 160 hours.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655502]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and

be a retrospective assessment of the disability and dependence of the subject immediately prior to admission that includes th e index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655438].  
o  Target for complete wean of all continuous IV third-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R  if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
p Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881855] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for re -treatment at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
r  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collectio n of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
s  Subjects may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the  CRF with details including date and time of 
starting /stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  Details of the first -line and second-line agents used to treat the subject prior 
to consenting for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
t All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and, after consent,  
the doses with start/stop times for each change in dose.  This recording of third-line agents will continue throughout the study until Visit 12/12R.

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or r ecurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisti ng epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with subst antial  morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted  to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly  to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents,

17 November 2015                                                                                                               15  Confiden tial 
 commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell e t al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizu re levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_881865] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different thi rd-line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_881866] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is

do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data  in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual inci dence of approximat ely 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage dat

3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or advers e effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover , but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complicat ions of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital /thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short t imeframe would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881868].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occu rring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.   Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecul ar proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive allosteric  
modulator of the GA BA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulat ed that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission beco me 
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;

3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development  program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_881870]- line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Pha se 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_881871]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled  by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_881872] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underl ying 
etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_881873] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the published

 rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SA Es (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these e vents 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_881874] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered:  
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the  third -line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_881875] of care

 alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its chal lenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical 
concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881876] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentra tions, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treat ment 
outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_881877] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881878] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of  the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_881879] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of th e overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_881880] commonly  reported AEs  were sedatio n (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs , but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects (20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related  to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_881881] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordanc e with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed cons ent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881883] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  T he informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic  component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their 
decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data Pr otection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precaution s will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a speci fic regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881888]- line agent or agents 
will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully 
weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and  outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a 
different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will be randomized to concomit ant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881889]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered 
one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_881890] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean 
attempts prior  to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of complet ing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] 
(H) [ADDRESS_881891] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than  two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881892] be confirmed  in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be adminis tered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment,  and in compliance with the protocol approved 
by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance  with ICH Guidelines on 
GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subj ects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization 
algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the 
treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be 
included in the SAP.   The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the primary endpoint wean.

8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedur es 
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investig ator ma y withdraw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request

 • The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related t o study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for pa rticipating  subjects.

The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_881903]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout  the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881904] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent incr eased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce se dation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it i s being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this proto col. 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration.

evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the 
EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be 
expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses 
than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_881907] 12 hours 
of the blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators  
and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hou r 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end 
of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a time ly manner in order 
to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
of the third- line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line 
agent if the subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the thi rd-line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881908] blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agen t needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_881909] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881910] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_881911] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of stud y 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after sta rting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881912] OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
admini stration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses o f 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting  the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_881913] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CE EG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a  variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.   This EEG will capture as much as possible of the burst suppression pattern that 
precedes the QW.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_881914]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst suppression, and the decision that the QW is a success . 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_881915] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
17 November 2015                                                                         51  Confidential  
 • EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open- label i nfusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_881916] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during t he taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30  minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after th e end 
of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881917] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the ta per of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be succes ses or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_881918].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the 
EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to s ervice the different EEG record 
requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655484]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); the 
QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_881919] line agents in order to confirm that the QW was a success . 
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655504]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line a gent or the third- line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression during the terminal wean).

endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881920] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655429] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_881921] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst suppression prior to the QW and 
during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470] -
response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the 
end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in  clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881922] question on the scale will not  be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_881923] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881928] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples w ill be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881929] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality  is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with diff erential,  
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC).

(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_881930] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881931] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547:

 • underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S amp les 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopreg nanolone 
(e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage p eriod of [ADDRESS_881935] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab  with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, + 12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_881936] samples taken as outlined above: subje cts receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_881937] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol

concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_881938] having two infusions of study drug will be 
99 ml (33 ml for subjects weighing  less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881939] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE -547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655418] 100 microlitres. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881940] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoecon omic Data  
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the  ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R?

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common assessment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i
 s a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged  or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881941] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407].

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifi edrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_881942] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete detai ls for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881954] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified accor ding to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded s tudy 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narr ative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE  or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude dat a from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_881955] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics

 13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity  analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will  use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until 
all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for a ll endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655510]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized .

methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obta ined 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CS R. 
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initiall y receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the  independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_881957] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analys is, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptio ns, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655642] 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics

 pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  
The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
 
 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881958] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentat ion of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monit oring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.

14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655669] e valuated and questioned generally  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured  on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_881959] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

unexpected suspected  adverse reactions  (see Section  14.3 for definitions ). 

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
17 November 2015                                                                         76  Confidential  
 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate  at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction , the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over  that listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_881961] medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
17 November 2015                                                                         77  Confidential  
 14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibi lity that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Inves tigator  or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  ano maly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881962] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that  discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of eme rgency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical 
monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380],  progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

 15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire compl etion , efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be r etained  for at least [ADDRESS_881963]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registr y database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The informa tion obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881964] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 Number of Subjects  
The study will randomize 140 subjects at up to 180 sites . 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_881976] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881977]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_655512], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881978] 12 hours of the infusion of blinded study drug. 
                                                 
1 In this study, the term Super -Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655305] “Refractory Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (RSE) that has failed 
standard treatment” and the two terms are used interchangeably.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881979]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_881980] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3).  Subjects who fail the Q W will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_881981] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be  randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third -line agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was al located to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_881982] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments (Table 1 and  Table 2).  
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -
547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all  subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not pl anned  or non-
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectat ion of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 days;

6. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_881987] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655513] [ADDRESS_881988] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmaco genetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_881989] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analys is will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance f or hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_881990] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully 
weaned off all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion 
and remains off third- line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, 
and who has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided  
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables f or treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re- institution of third -
line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculate d for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and once during each 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, i f applicable).  
Daily weight will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of each dose.  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_881991] ha d a hysterectomy. 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and th e investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are tho se that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chem istry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that pr ompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1 ) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the blinded (first) study drug infusion: Pre -dose 
(V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open label SA GE-547 (second) study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), 
at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significan t abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to 160 hours.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion  of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately  prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to t he end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately  
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately pr ior to the end of the third taper step), +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the  start of the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.

q Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
r  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_881993] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for re -treatment at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10 , then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
s  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue  throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
t  Subjects may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the  CRF with details including date and time of 
starting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], th e route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  Details of the first -line and second-line agents used to treat the subject prior 
to consenting for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was de emed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
u All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and , after cons ent, 
the doses with start/stop times for each change in dose.  This recording of third-line agents will continue throughout the study until Visit 12/12R.

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hoc
ker, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop

 all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
commonly propofol, midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, referred  to as third -line agents  (Brophy, 
Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG ) to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_882003] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882004] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the te rm “SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, based on patients who r equired at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.  
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE

 that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functio nal outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital/thiopental, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control 
SRSE  has only been  studied  in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without 
controls (Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore there is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor 
on an  optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882006] -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising  
decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882007].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injectio n (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecul ar proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive allosteric  
modulator of the GA BA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulat ed that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission beco me 
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to

 the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
extrasynaptic receptors  remain  active  with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting in a putative mode of 
action for SAGE -[ADDRESS_882008] suppression 
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development  program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 ra ndomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_882009]- line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Pha se 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_882010]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled  by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_882011] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underl ying 
etiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_882012] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the published 
rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SA Es (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these e vents 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_882013] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital/thiopental, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered:  
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data 
on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the  third -line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment 
guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of prospective, concurrent control data;

 • Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_882014] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its chal lenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third-
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882015] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentra tions, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treat ment 
outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_882016] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882017] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of  the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_882018] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of th e overall clinical study is optional.

Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs , but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related  to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882020] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_882021]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882022]  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed cons ent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  T he informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic  component.  If subject chooses 
to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject 
understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data Pr otection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precaution s will be taken to preserve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a speci fic regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all 
cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will  be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882029]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_882030] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomi zed to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655591]/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third line  agent wean 
attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmaci sts and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.

8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdr awal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier  than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882038] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investig ator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_882045]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demo nstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_882046] “fa iled first- line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patie nt took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout  
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
defin itions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those  wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring su ch sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded a s well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882047] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882048] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean o ff all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third-l ine agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital /thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the 
EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses 
than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_882049] 12 hours 
of the blinded study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators  
and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Thiopental: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to discuss 
EEGs related to key  study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end 
of the blinded study drug infusion if the terminal wean was successful ) in a timely manner in order 
to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guideli nes. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882050] -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
of the third- line agent if the subject is on only one third -line agent or the wean of the last third -line 
agent if the subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third- line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attem pt. 
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_882051] may then  be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882052] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882053] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
17 November 2015                                                                         51  Confidential  
 TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be co mpleted as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
manage d in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is th e subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting th e blinded administration of study drug or 
after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_882054] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A 24-hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.   This EEG will capture as much as possible  of the burst suppression pattern that 
precedes the QW.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_882055]- line agent(s) , the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) at 
doses intended to induce burst suppression, and the decision that the QW is a success .

17 November 2015                                                                         52  Confidential  
 • EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to [ADDRESS_882056] 12 hours of blinded study drug infusion. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or  terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_882057] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or afte r 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882058] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG wil l be 25.[ADDRESS_882059].  In some cases (the TAEEG 
and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the 
different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG fi le will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure or success on 
the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent 
reinstituted for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean  constitutes a failure ); the 
QWEEG will extend to cover the [ADDRESS_882060] line agents in order to 
confirm that the QW was a success . 
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655428]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655414] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression duri ng the terminal wean).  
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent  by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882061] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882062] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following will be read centrally  to confirm the depth of burst suppression prior to the QW and 
during the first 12 hours of the blinded study drug infusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470] -
response to blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more 
than two microvolts):

All EEG records may be subject to quantitative EEG analysis .   
11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of  information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respe ctively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882063] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_882064] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

• The number of calendar days since H144 at the end of Visit [ADDRESS_882065] has 
been free of SE up to and including Visit 12 or Visit 12R;  
• The number of calendar days since H144 at the end of Vi sit [ADDRESS_882066] has

− Type of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655365].  
11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882067]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table  2, and Table 3 (Schedules of Assessments) . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882068] preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version).  See Section  14 for 
additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion  of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882069] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882070] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
For adults  and children > 30 kg , these samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour 
medical decisions will be based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part 
of normal standard of c are.  GFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_2237].   For children  under 30 
kg, results of local laboratory testing undertaken at the protocolled timepoints may be sent to the 
central laboratory for inclusion in the central study laboratory database; this obviates the need for additional blood sampling for central laboratory testing.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC)  count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular  
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration (MCHC). 
Serum chemistry  will include albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  chloride, creatine kinase,  
lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and  glucose.   In addition 
triglycerides will be measured in serum chemistry samples (to aid assessment of lipemia in 
pharmacokinetic samples).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_882071] will be ineligible for study  
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessment of protein, blood, leukocytes, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, pH,  
and specific  gravity.   
11.2.3. Vital  Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperatur e will be recorded at the following time  points relative to 
the first infusion of study drug, and to the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882072] qualify 
for the second infusion of SAGE-547: 
• Visit 1 ; 
• At 0, +30, +60 minutes (+/ -15 minutes ) and +2, +4 and +8 hours (+/ - 30 min utes) after the 
start of the infusion; 
• At +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (+/ - 2 hours) after the start of the 
infusion. 
11.2.4. Weight and Height 
Weight and height will be measured at V isit [ADDRESS_882073]’s weight (such as information from the LAR or estimating using an established local protocol).  
11.2.5. ECG  
12-lead ECG s should be performed at Visit [ADDRESS_882074] be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK 
samples up to 160 hours ; at other times the allowed time window for ECGs is +/- 2 hours: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +128, +136, +144, +152, 
+160, and +1 92 hours after the start of the blinded (first) study drug infusion  
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 , +3, +6, + 12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +126, +132, +138, +144, 
+152, +16 0, and +1 92 hours after the start of the open -label (second) study drug  
The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
11.2.6. Mortality  
Mortality will be recorded on the Visit [ADDRESS_882075] has died, the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
17 November 2015                                                                         58  Confidential  
 • Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intu bation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
intere st for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic  variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrog enase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the  DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
17 November 2015                                                                         59  Confidential  
 Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samp les for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_882076] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab with a 
validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -547 
metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately p rior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediate ly prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after t he start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_882077] samples taken as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_882078] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and 
metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol® concentrations; experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_882079] having two infusions of 
study drug will be 99 ml (33 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameter s for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., C
max, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882080] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations.  The minimum volume of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655418] 100 microlitres. 
Full details of all phar macokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882081] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]:

 • Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371]

(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity,  no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
unsuitable home circumstances, other)? 
[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is  designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or  in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilit ation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS) 
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overn ight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i s a one -step procedure 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882082]'s  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882083] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to deter mine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified 
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_882084] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete detai ls for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882096] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified accor ding to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded s tudy 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narr ative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE  or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude dat a from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key s econdary efficacy endpoints. 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882097] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.

 13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity  analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will  use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until 
all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for a ll endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous 
endpoints (time to re-institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655510]) will be performed using Analysis of 
Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital/thiopental use and number of 
previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non-parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized .

methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obta ined 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CS R. 
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initiall y receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the  independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_882099] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analys is, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptio ns, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655642] 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics

 pentobarbital/thiopental use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior 
to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The 
SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
 
 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882100] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentat ion of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monit oring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655669] e valuated and questioned generally  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured  on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administra tion of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  admini stration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfor t sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical  change  that requires  immediate  corrective

 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate  at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction , the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over  that listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_882103] medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.

 14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibi lity that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Inves tigator  or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  ano maly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882104] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The Investigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that  discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure 
that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of eme rgency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical 
monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380],  progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire compl etion , efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be r etained  for at least [ADDRESS_882105]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registr y database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The informa tion obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882106] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the

Number of Subjects  
The study will randomize 140 subjects at up to 150 sites . 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting .  Pediatric patients ( those < 14 years of age) will be managed 
in a pediatric intensive care  setting.  
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_882118] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from  
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882119] -line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882120] -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in

sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882122] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fai l the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882123] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) will be used to 
achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and 
placebo).   
The ran domized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_882124] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of asses sments (Table 1 and Error! Not a 
valid result for table. ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the  blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

3. To compare between SAGE -547 and placebo t he time between meeting the secondary response 
endpoint, defined in (2) above, and the re -institution of any third -line agent for seizure or burst 
suppression up to Visit 12; 
4. To compare the change in the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI)  between SAGE -547 and 
placebo up to Visit 12;

3. Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy. 
4. Children (subjects aged less than 17 years) with an encephalopathy due to a  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_655516].  
5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned or non-
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogeni c or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 days; 
e.  a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. 
6. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_882129] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_882130] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above , for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882131] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The 
SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report.  
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Si nce the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
[ADDRESS_882132] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization 
(one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully weaned off 
all third -line agents and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion and remains 
off third -line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, and who 
has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be based on 
the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of 
significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT pop ulation.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups 
in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been eva luated or one of the analyses yields a non -significant 
result.  Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and 
number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third -line 
agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomit ant 
pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and ar e retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_882133] udy is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to fi rst-line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
[ADDRESS_882146] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_882147] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882148] treatment.  In this protocol, the term  “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage dat
a on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortalit
y in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of 
02 Dec  2015                                                                                                               15  Confidential

medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital, known as third -line agents.   Use of these  drugs  to control SRSE  has 
only been  studied in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without controls 
(Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor on an 
optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882150].

luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive allosteric  
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;

(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or place bo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Phase 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_882152]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_882153] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the  547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_882154] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the publishe d

rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_882155] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatme nt guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_882156] of care 
02 Dec  2015                                                                                                               15  Confidential

alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882157]  dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_882158] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882159] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_882160] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participatio n of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_882161] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007) .  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882162] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_882163]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
[ADDRESS_882164] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their 
decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -547 administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to subjects in SRSE . Pediatric 
patients (those < 14 years of age) will be managed in a pediatric intensive care setting.  
Figure [ADDRESS_882170]- line agent or agents 
will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a 
different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will be randomized to concomitant  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882171]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered 
one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_882172] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors 
will not be able to ascertain which subject was  allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_882173] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
[ADDRESS_882174] be confirmed in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment  (2008), and in compliance with the protocol 
approved by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance with ICH 
Guidelines on GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be included in the 
SAP.    
The randomized portion of the study wi ll be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the primary endpoint wean.

research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882178]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
[ADDRESS_882179] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter.  
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the  dosing schedule s in Table 5.  
The infusion rates to accomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the first infusion of study 
medication .

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882185] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_882186]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_882187] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant T hird-Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean a ttempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dos e of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indicatio n for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not consti tute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes.

the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882189]

microvolts ) to be deemed  to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third-line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at maintenance doses 
alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the EEG.  The following 
are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected alone or in 
combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses than these and are 
not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_882190] 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators  and will exit the 
study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of pe rforming 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to review EEGs 
in real time related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the end of the blinded study drug infusion) in order to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical 
Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
[ADDRESS_882191]- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agen ts other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open -label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_882192] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882193] ivity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882194] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
02 Dec  2015                                                                         50  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW sh ould ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any  case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third- line agent bei ng weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every ef fort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or 
after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_882195] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being used to support key investigator decis ions will be collected at the following time points:  
• A six -hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patter ns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to eligibility.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_882196]- line agent(s) or the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) 
at doses intended to induce burst suppression. 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to five  hours 
after the start of the blinded infusion.  This will be called the BIEEG.  The intent of this EEG 
is to see the effect that the loading dose of blinded study drug infusion has on the EEG. 
02 Dec  2015                                                                         51  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of t hird-line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject  was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_882197] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administratio n of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after  
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882198] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the e nd of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will  be 25.[ADDRESS_882199].  In some cases (the TAEEG 
and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the 
different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG fil e will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655478] t the EEG 
shows, as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655484]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent reinstituted 
for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean).  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655518]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal wean (inability to wean off the third- line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882200] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655429] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882201] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confir m the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470]- response to 
blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ). 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the QWEEG read; 
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not retreated will have the BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and 
PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion collected and stored, and the QWEEG, 
TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion read;

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882202] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_882203] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882208] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing d one outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated using values from local laboratory tests.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about

significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
11.2.6. Mortality  
Mortality will be recorded on the Visit [ADDRESS_882212] has died, the 
following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes :  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
[ADDRESS_882213]’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subj ect population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distribution, safety, tolerability,  and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or g ene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA wi ll be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or a t 
any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal 
or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DN A. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established li nk will be used to identify relevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis  
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage perio d of [ADDRESS_882214] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent.

11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma and urine analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab 
with a validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -
547 metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is p ermissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_882215] samples taken 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_882216] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and 
metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol® concentrations; experien ce with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_882217] having two infusions of 
study drug will be 99 ml (66 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882218] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained f rozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed  to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882219] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the dat e of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
unsuitable home circumstances, other)?

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i s a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882220] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
[ADDRESS_882231] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all effica cy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will b e 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narrativ es will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655672] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defin ed as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882232] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agen t wean attempts prior to 
02 Dec  2015                                                                         70  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time 
to re -institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without 
status epi [INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with 
variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital  use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it 
is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may 
also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence  will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
02 Dec  2015                                                                         71  Confidential

13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the p harmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples  will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subj ects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non-responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_882233] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus P AEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. R andomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes 
or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or 
more).    
[ADDRESS_882234] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655673]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_882235] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Dru g 
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective  
action.

14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  event s that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
[ADDRESS_882238] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approva l by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The I nvestigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.
 
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs ) 
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.  
02 Dec  2015                                                                         79  Confidential

15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_882239]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
[ADDRESS_882240] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE  Sage Therapeutics  
  
The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 150 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_882253] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consen t themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882254]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully wean ed will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG  burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882255]

[ADDRESS_882256]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882257] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882258] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be strat ified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) will be used to 
achieve 1:1 balance across the stratific ation  factors and between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and 
placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_882259] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments (Table 1 and Error! Not a 
valid result for table. ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be e ligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

4. Children (subjects aged less than 1 7 years) with an encephalopathy due to a  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_655312].  
5. Subjects who have any of the following: 
a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned or non-
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 days; 
e.  a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. 
6. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_882264] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 3 0 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_882265] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882266] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primar y Endpoint  
[ADDRESS_882267] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization 
(one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully weaned off 
all third -line agents  and blinded study medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion and remains 
off third -line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, and who 
has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be based on 
the ITT Population.  The com parison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of 
significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Seco ndary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655520] d
iagnoses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and 
number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third -line 
agents fo r primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655315]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is f ound there are too many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subj ects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treat ment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

d  Weight will be collected at Screening (V1) and once during each 24 hour period of the initial study drug  infusion period (V3- V8) and second infusion period (V3R -V8R, if applicable).  
Daily weight will be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate of each dose.  
e  Serum pregnancy test for females  aged [ADDRESS_882268] had a hysterectomy. . 
f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorde d as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of  study drug .  Any out -of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the blinded (first) study drug infusion: Pre -dose 
(V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), 
at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR , QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to 160 hours.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:   For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96,  +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE -547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96,  +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step), +144 ( immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and inclu ding 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start o f each infusion of study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  Modified Rankin Score (mRS) applicable for subjects ≥[ADDRESS_882269]-line agents by 144 hours at V8/V8R if not completed by 120 hours at V7/V7R.  
q Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
r  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882270] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for re -treatm ent at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
s  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
t  Subjects may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the CRF with details including date and time of 
starting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  Details of the f irst-line and second-line agents used to treat the subject prior 
to consenting  for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
u All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and , after consent,  
the doses with start/stop times for each change in dose.  This record ing of third -line agents will continue throughout the study until Visit 12/12R.

3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hoc
ker, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
[ADDRESS_882280] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al.  
2012). 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995).  
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_882281] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012).  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882282] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker,  
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013).  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute morta
lity in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital, known as third -line agents.   Use of these  drugs  to control SRSE  has 
only been  studied in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without controls 
(Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor on an 
optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882284].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenousl y. 
3.4.1. Scientif ic Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive alloste ric 
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655522] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
[ADDRESS_882285] suppression 
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or plac ebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Phase 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_882286]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_882287] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying etiologies of SE in the  547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_882288] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the publishe d

rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_882289] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatme nt guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_882290] of care

alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882291]  dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_882292] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882293] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_882294] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participatio n of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_882295] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882296] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .

56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
[ADDRESS_882298] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their 
decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882304]- line agent or agents 
will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a 
different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will be randomized to concomitant  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882305]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered 
one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_882306] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was  allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_882307] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
[ADDRESS_882308] be confirmed in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment  (2008), and in compliance with the protocol 
approved by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance with ICH 
Guidelines on GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be included in the 
SAP.    
The randomized portion of the study wi ll be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the primary endpoint wean.

the exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655517] [ADDRESS_882311] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 
previously (i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
8.3. Selection and Cons ent of Subjects for Pharmacogenetic Substudy  
All subjects will be asked to participate in pharmacogenetic research; however, participation in 
research is voluntary and a subject can decide to decline his/her participation without penalty or loss of benefit .  Participation or lack thereof will not be a cause for exclusion from any aspect of the main 
study.   In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic 
research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have received a non -leukocyte-depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882312]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal, 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
[ADDRESS_882313] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter.  
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

10. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Dosing Schedule  (Blinded Infusions)  
SAGE -547 Injection  or placebo will be administered  according  to the  dosing schedule s in Table 5.  
The infusion rates to a ccomplish these µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of 
the subject.  The infusion rates will be applied to blinded study drug for the first infusion of study 
medication .

If a subject fails wean from third -line agent(s) or requires re- instatement of third -line therapy within 
24 hours of discontinuing the initial infusion of study drug, SAGE -547 Injection  will be re-
administer ed according  to the  dosing schedule in  Table 6.  The infusion rates to accomplish these 
µg/kg/h doses will be calculated according to the weight of the subject.  The se infusion rates will be 
applied to SAGE-547 re -treatment for the open-label second infusions of study medication.

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882319] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_882320]  may be given  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator at  any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study  from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  and 
recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_882321] “failed first -line 
agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in  Section  8) admini stered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Details will include 
the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times , and, after consent, the doses with start and 
stop times for each change in dose.   This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout 
the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates  and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (su ccessful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after the 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF wi ll make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the dose s used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
[ADDRESS_882322] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882323] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital, midazolam, pr opofol , and ketamine  at maintenance doses 
alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the EEG.  The following 
are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected alone or in 
combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses than these and are 
not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_882324] 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators and will exit the 
study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to review EEGs 
in real time related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, an d the period after the 
end of the blinded study drug infusion) in order to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
[ADDRESS_882325]- line agent;  the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
place after  the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re- instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_882326] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882327] ivity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882328] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
01 Mar 2016                                                                          50  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case  over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third- line agent being we aned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agent  or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_882329] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the 
seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points:  
• A six -hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_882330]- line agent(s) or the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) 
at doses intended to induce burst suppression. 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to five hour s 
after the start of the blinded infusion.  This will be called the BIEEG.  The intent of this EEG 
is to see the effect that the loading dose of blinded study drug infusion has on the EEG. 
01 Mar 2016                                                                          51  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_882331] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using 
intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administratio n of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after  
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882332] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the e nd of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study 
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will  be 25.[ADDRESS_882333].  In some cases (the TAEEG 
and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the 
different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG fil e will be de -identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG and 
the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655478] t the EEG 
shows, as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655484]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent reinstituted 
for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean).  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655518]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal wean (inability to wean off the third- line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882334] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655429] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882335] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confir m the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470]- response to 
blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ). 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the QWEEG read; 
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not retreated will have the BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and 
PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion collected and stored, and the QWEEG, 
TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion read;

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after  initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882336] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in t his trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_882337] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated 
at Visit 12 or 12R.

11.2. Safety Assessments  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882340]  of care and will be collected  periodically  throughout the study 
according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected  after informed  consent has been signed  and prior to study -specific s creening  
procedures  not considered  standard of care,  during subject preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  Dictionary

11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calculated at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882341] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882342] 
qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be based 
on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of care.  GFR 
will be calculated using values from local laboratory tests.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment about 
whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology and Serum Chemistry 
Hematology  will include complete blood count (CBC) white blood cell count with differential, 
platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular

Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women may 
not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_882343] will be ineligible for study  
participation.

significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
11.2.6. Mortality  
Mortality will be recorded on the Visit [ADDRESS_882346] has died, the 
following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorized  as due to  
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• study drug;  
• other (specify).  
[ADDRESS_882347]’s LAR consents to pharm acogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specif ic 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objecti ve of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and 
exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specifi c genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for inf luencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility an d drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sampl e and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract laboratory  for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify rele vant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extra cted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_882348] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent.

11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma and urine analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab 
with a validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for important SAGE -
547 metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points relative 
to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immed iately after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified.  
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_882349] samples tak en 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_882350] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations;  experience with the plasma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_882351] having two infusions of 
study drug will be 99 ml (66 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882352] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample t o be retained frozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882353] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12R , the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type  of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]:

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882354] immediately prior to the 
admission th at included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_882355] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
[ADDRESS_882365] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all effica cy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will b e 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narrativ es will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655672] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defin ed as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882366] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agen t wean attempts prior to 
01 Mar 2016                                                                          70  Confidential  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
randomization (one vs two or more).  The CMH general association statistic  and its associated p -
value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time 
to re -institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without 
status epi [INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with 
variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital  use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it 
is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may 
also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence  will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.

13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the p harmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples  will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subj ects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non-responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_882367] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus P AEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. R andomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes 
or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or 
more).    
[ADDRESS_882368] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 s ummarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655673]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_882369] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was  
re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy  of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (e.g., admission report, 
laboratory test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be included as part of the 
subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Dru g 
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects,  this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  event s that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
[ADDRESS_882372] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approva l by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The I nvestigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.
 
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs ) 
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_882373]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
[ADDRESS_882374] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 150 sites. 
Study Population 
Subjects will be aged 17 years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_882386] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882387]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean 
is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a di fferent third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882388]

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882389]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line ag ent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882390] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882391] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization ( one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) will be used to 
achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and 
placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_882392] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2).  
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, 
so subjects who failed on SAGE-547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible 
to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

 a. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not planned  or non -
continuous dialysis is  planned (that would not adequately remove Captisol®); 
b. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors  that is not related to 
third -line agent use; 
c. fulminant hepatic failure; 
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a li kely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 days; 
e.  a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. 
5. Subjects who are being administered more than three third- line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_882399] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days ; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_882400] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 previously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882401] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the inter im analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_882402] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization 
(one vs two or more) .  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully weaned off 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882403] 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, and who 
has concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be based on 
the ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of 
significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing 
process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant 
result.  Secondary analyses w ill be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided 
for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655524]) will be evaluated via 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and 
number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third -line 
agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are t
oo many tied 
observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinde d study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially r eceiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line ag ent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

f  Blood samples will be taken for hematology and serum chemistry and GFR calculation at V 1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study 
drug. Any out -of-range values will be flagged and the investigator will document whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that 
prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.  
g  Blood samples will be taken at V11 or V11R for serum chemistry (renal panel only).   
h  Urine samples will be taken for urinalysis and NAG at V1, at 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 hours (± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of study drug .  Any out-of-range values 
will be flagged and the investigator will add a comment about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinically significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention 
and will be recorded as adverse events.  
i  Vital signs will be recorded at the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug :  Screening (V1), at 0, 30, 60 minutes (± 15 minutes), at 2, 4, and 8 hours 
(± 30 minutes), and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   
j  ECG (12 -lead) should be performed at Screening (V1) and at the following times relative to the start of study drug infusion.  For the blinded (first) study drug infusion: Pre -dose 
(V3/V3R), at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,  128, 136,  144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).  For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion: Pre -dose (V3/V3R), 
at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, 160, and 192 hours (± 2 hours).   Heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc  intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities in the rhythm.   All efforts must be made to perform ECGs immediately after the PK samples up to 160 hours.  
k Plasma will be collected to assay for study drug  concentrations at  the following time points relative to the start of each infusion of study drug:  For the blinded (first) study drug 
infusion: • pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately  prior to the end of the maintenance 
infusion), +128 (immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655317]), +152,  and +160 hours afte r the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion.   For the open label SAGE -547 (second) study drug infusion : • pre-dose and 
at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), +3, +6, +12, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately  prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 (immediately 
prior to the end of the first taper step), +132 (immediately prior to the end of the second taper step), +138 (immediately pr ior to the end of the third taper step), +144 (immediately after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of the open label SAGE -547 study drug infusion.   Pre-dose samples may be taken within two hours before starting 
the infusion of study drug; timepoints up to and including 1h will have a time window of +/ - 5 minutes ; all other timepoints will have a window of +/- 15 minutes . 
m  FOUR Score assessments will be performed at Screening (V1), 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hours ( all ± 2 hours) relative to the start of each infusion of  study drug , and at 
V11 or V11R, and at V12 or V12R.   
n  SRS at V1 will be a retrospective assessment of the supervision required by [CONTACT_655668] i ncludes the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655438], and mRS at V1 will 
be a retrospectiv e assessment of the disability and dependence of the subject immediately prior to admission that includes the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_655438].

p Study drug infusion is intended for IV administration only with a dedicated peripheral IV line using Sage -approved IV administration bags and lines.  
q  At V10 only a decision to re -treat at a higher dose of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882405] -line agent requires 
re-introduction during V9.  Subjects who become eligible for re -treatment at a higher dose of SAGE -547 will discontinue the planned visit schedule at V10, then repeat V3 (V3R) and 
all applicable subsequent visits.  
r  AEs will be collected from the time Informed Consent is obtained and prior to the start of study -specific screening procedures not considered standard of care.  Collection of AEs will 
continue throughout the study from V1 through V12 or V12R.   
s  Subjects  may enter the study on AEDs and be administered AEDs during the study.  All Concomitant AEDs must be recorded on the CRF with details including date and time of 
starting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655465], the route of administration, changes in doses, and frequency of administration.  Details of the first-line and second-line agents used to treat the subject prior to consenting for the study will be recorded on the CRF, noting at what point the subject was deemed to have “failed first -line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
t All third -line agents administered since the diagnosis of SE will be recorded on the CRF.  Details will include the name [CONTACT_18467], t he start/stop dates and times, and, after consent,

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care Society  defines  
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE  include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease  (in adults), 
electrolyte  and metabolic  disturbances,  anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is associated  
with substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655400], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The  incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  that 
in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  population, 
which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19-year retrospective study  in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota  (Hesdorffer, Logroscino 
et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study in  Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) , 
respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, ranging  
between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000 ; Knake, Rosenow et al. 2001) .  
It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there are as many  as 150,000 cases  of SE 
(DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012 ), which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an IV 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Shorvon 
2011; Hocke
r, Britton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - line 
agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70 -80% of patients  who receive 
second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is diagnosed 
as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to terminate  the seizure  
activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE patients  are immediately  
admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a medically -induced coma to stop 
all seizure- related  activity.   The drugs used to induce coma are continuously-infused IV agents, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882415] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 
2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656], 
informing medical  personnel  of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require  the 
administration  of a second -line AED therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these patients  
treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up 
to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   Based  on the 
previously- cited  estimated  incidence  in the US,  this means  that there  are up to  42,000 incident cases  
of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After  [ADDRESS_882416] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent  is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882417] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard treatment” is 
deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used interchangeably. 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402] -refractory .  A recent 
review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual inc idence of approximatel y 35,000, 
based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for S E [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mor tality  depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using curren t standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous,  resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse effects  of the current  standard  
treatments.   Prognosis  worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer duration of SE, i.e. with SE 
that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ), and with longer duration of

 medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  need  to 
improve upon the current  standard of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013 ).  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional outcome.

adding and changing  anti- seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning from  IV anesthetic  
agents.   Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications of extended  periods of anesthesia or  unconsciousness ( Shorvon 
2011) .  
Currently,  there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital, known as third -line agents.   Use of these  drugs  to control SRSE  has 
only been  studied in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without controls 
(Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor on an 
optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
dose adjustments  and changes  in third -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse  effect  profile,  comprising

 decreased  blood pressure and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_655334] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The ability  
to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents as  quickly as possible is therefore paramount, 
and an adjunct to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  and supports 
their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition  to the therapeutic  
armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882419].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring  neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard treatment.   SAGE -547 Injection  
is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP and 250 
mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for Injection, 
USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 1.67  
mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously. 
3.4.1. Scientific  R ationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective  recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance occurring  
in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the central  nervous 
system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  types  of GABA  
receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A receptors  are 
macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  specific  binding 
sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators, including barbiturates,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
and some anesthetic agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes significantly  to the 
normal termination  of a seizure (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is a positive allosteric  
modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure  activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to control 
as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift from  
inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory  receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  
As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic  inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A neurotransmission become  
less effective the longer  SE continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes to 
the reduction of inhibitory transmission  observed during prolonged seizures (Kapur and Mac donald 
1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  GABA A receptors;  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882420] suppression 
(Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expanded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or placebo), 
during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the Phase 3 
studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being administered SAGE -
547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a higher dose, 
which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the Phase 2 study.  Follow up 
of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_882421]  of care for SRSE,  a 
serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  comprise 20 from  the 
ongoing Phase  2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 subjects who received EIND  
treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled by [CONTACT_209615],  
without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or death  during 
therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the efficacy  
assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) subjects  with 
SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_882422] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying
 etiologies of SE in the  547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_882423] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the publishe d

 rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, organophosphate 
toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655407], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these events 
to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects (20%) 
experienced AEs considered  possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_882424] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655408], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data; 
• Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a field where no widely adopted treatme nt guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_882425] of care

 alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is associated 
with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often exhausted all 
treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: firstly all patients 
receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be weaned from their third -
line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be administered open- label 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882426]  dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of subjects 
experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid conditions.  
The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial SAGE -[ADDRESS_882427] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for 
both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 
102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open- label infusion of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882428] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_882429] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participatio n of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures 
in men and women up to [ADDRESS_882430] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation (recorded as  
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild headache ( Timby, 
Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007).  No SAEs were  reported (Navarro, Kaddouz 
et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ; Kask, Backstrom et al. 
2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the reduced 
consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously -
repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts (20%), 
all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the context of 
published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882431] a high risk of severe morbidity  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) .  
The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_882432]  (IRB)  where the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and must 
also conduct the study in accordance with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to  give consent.  Therefore, consent will 
be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882433] gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study, written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of consent to be obtained will depend on the condition of the subject as determined by  [CONTACT_11087].  The informed consent form  (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB, must 
follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 
21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated study  
monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components of 
the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e a specific 
consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study consent form.  The 
principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their 
decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional 
situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882438]- line agent or agents 
will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], 
adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a 
different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression 
and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882439]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered 
one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG 
for [ADDRESS_882440] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatme nts (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will b e made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting 
at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_882441] evidence of physiologic brain activity (average 
EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolts) at the end of the primary endpoint 
assessment period  as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  Details of the assessments 
and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882442] be confirmed in 
writing by [CONTACT_655610] -label infusion starting.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo 
will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose. 
 
Figure  1: Study  Design  
 
7.2. Trial  Conduct  
This study will be conducted  according  to the principles of the World  Medical  Association  
Declaration  of Helsinki and most recent  amendment  (2008), and in compliance with the protocol 
approved by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance with ICH 
Guidelines on GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to  be randomized 
to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) 
will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups 
(SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization process will be included in the 
SAP.    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and 
monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject wa s allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who failed 
the primary endpoint wean.

compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  withdrawal , 
including the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  from Visit 
12/12R.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo study procedures 
as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  period. 
The investigator may  withdr aw the subject from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request

 • The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an  AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to  
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  subjects, 
administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage Therapeutics  will 
provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB 
and initiate  withdrawal  procedures  for participating  subjects.

the study until Visit 12/12R.  
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt w ill be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this third -
line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur after th e 
TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol  is the preferred 
agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose .  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses 
used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure 
or burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purposes does not constitute 
a wean failure under this protocol . 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start a nd stop dates 
and times of all dose changes. 
10.5.4. Other Concomitant Medications 
All other concomitant medications must be recorded on the eCRF with details including date and 
time of starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the route of administration, dose, and frequency of adm inistration.

randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all third -
line agents will be considered as “failures” for the primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at maintenance doses 
alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst  suppression pattern on the EEG.  The following 
are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected alone or in 
combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses than these and are 
not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_882457] 12 hours of the blinded 
study drug infusion, they will be considered to be screen failures/protocol violators  and will exit the 
study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour  
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the bes t medical interests of the subject.   Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to review EEGs 
in real time related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period after the 
end of the blinded study drug infusion) in order to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical 
Standardization Guidelines. 
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean 
of the third- line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last third -line 
agent if the subject is on more than one third- line agent; the other weans (OW), which are the weans 
of the third- line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third- line agent.   The 
guidance als o applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third line agents that take 
place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second open- label study drug 
infusion.

 QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third- line agent  being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that third -line 
agent or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_882458] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882459] -line a gent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882460] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the 
weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the  open-label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
• If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of stud y drug or starting the open- label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally begin 
as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later than H97 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or af ter starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547.

 • The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours.  
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be managed in this way, the third-line agent being weaned should be re-instituted at a dose that 
was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace  this third -line 
agen t or be administered  in addition to the third- line agent that is the subject of the wean 
attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or 
after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_882461] -line agent being 
weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG being 
used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A six -hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent is 
to demo nstrate  the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_882462]- line agent(s) or the decision to re -institute a third -line agent(s) 
at doses intended to induce burst suppression. 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to five hours 
after the start of the blinded infusion.  This will be called the BIEEG.  The intent of this EEG 
is to see the effect that the loading dos e of blinded study drug infusion has on the EEG. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open- label infu sion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_882463] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end 
of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882464] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the 
24-hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of study  
treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882465].  In some cases (the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the 
EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken t o service the different EEG record 
requirements.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882466] number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, 
QWEEG , BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655411], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655412]. 
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the 
qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third- line agent reinstituted 
for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean).  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655428]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal 
wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted for burst 
suppression during the terminal wean). 
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655525] a failure on the primary endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882467] suppression before the end of the SAGE -547 
infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655429] a failure on the primary 
endpoint (inability to wean off the third- line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882468] suppression in the 24 hours following the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470]- response to 
blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment per iod ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ). 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the QWEEG read; 
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, 
or read;  
• Those subjects randomized who are not retreated will have the BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion collected and stored, and the QWEEG, 
TWEEG, and PAEEG related to the blinded study drug infusion read; 
• Those subjects randomized who are retreated will have the BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG and

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating  of the subject’s condition.  Both the CGI -Severity  
(Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale 
measuring  severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  
assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882470] question on the scale will not be employed in this trial, and 
where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_882471] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be evaluated

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882481]’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -family 
genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the GABA receptor (e.g. 
GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes associated with the 
production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibi lity and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at any designated contract lab oratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific analysis.  
No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person (internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA. 
Genotype/Phenotype Analysi s: Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify r elevant 
DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, allow 
regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary blood 
samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses are 
possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_882482] visit has been reached, 
or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma and urine analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab 
with a validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography tandem

to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  and 
+160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, +24, 
+48, +72, +96, +120  (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +126 
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immed iately after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start of 
the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified.  
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  
Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_882483] samples tak en 
as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_882484] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol

concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_882485] having two infusions of study dru g will be 
99 ml (66 ml for subjects weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882486] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained frozen 
for subsequent analysis of SAGE-547 concentrations. 
Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882487] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Vis it 12 or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data wi ll be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” an d the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R?  
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlyin g disease, 
ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >15 at Visit 12/12R and the subject was in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655371] 
12/12R, what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], 
unsuitable home circumstances, other)?

 [IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open-label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common asses sment  scale  used to standardize descriptions of the objective 
degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It was first used 
in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975 ) and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of rehabilitation  
to return  to work  and everyday life.   The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups:  
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative st ate 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject  receives  from  
caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally be 
grouped into five ranked categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  Supervision, 
Full-Time  Indirect Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was designed  to be 
rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with  the subject  and an informant  who has observed  at first 
hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring i s a one -step procedure 
in which  the clinician  assigns  the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   Ratings  are based  on 
the level  of supervision received,  not on how much supervision a subject is judged or predicted  to 
need.  
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882488] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and functional 
dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) denotes 
functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The Modified

 Rankin Scale – 9Q is a shortened  version  consisting  of 9 questions that reliably  determines  the mRS  
score and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the rater base to non- medically  
trained  personnel ( Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The  assessment  is a web -based  tool in  the public domain 
with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at www.modifiedrankin.com.  
The mRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882489] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will 
be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment 
will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882499] had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all effica cy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled.  
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attemp ts.  Narratives will include  details of  the cause 
of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the infusion 
or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655633] .  Acceptable reasons for defining a subject as 
MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of the underlying cause 
of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or pr ogression of disease were thought by 
[CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations  or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity analyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882500] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) between 
SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT population 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital us e (yes or n o) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to

value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% 
level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of 
second ary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant differenc e between groups in the primary endpoint, the 
first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyse s yields a non- significant result.  The analysis 
of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary statistics will 
be provided for all endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from b aseline in CGI, secondary 
response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) 
will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time 
to re -institution of third line agents for primary and secondary response, number of days without 
status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of  Variance with 
variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital  use and number of previous wean attempts .  If it 
is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may 
also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655527].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.

 13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the sa mples.   
Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component of the 
study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be obtained 
to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic Analysis P lan 
will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic research will be 
reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_882501] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG (exploratory 
analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment groups 
at a 5% level of significance. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes 
or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or 
more).    
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882502] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding  the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655673]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medi cal History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event Form.  Any clinically  significant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  clinical 
findings are considered an AE and must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, unless otherwise 
stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs  considered not related to  study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 
12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic  Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  information 
as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When new significant 
information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known,  the electronic SAE  eCRF 
should be updated within [ADDRESS_882503] was an  outpatient at the time of the SAE and was

subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state. 
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.

Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign 
or symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; 
prescription drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.

 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report that information  in 
an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study treatment  
that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before submitting  an IND safety  
report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) suspected  adverse 
reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the definitions, it should 
not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the available information  
and decide whether  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the adverse event  and, 
therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there  is a serious and unex pected  suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the safety 
of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.

 14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more severe  form,  might  have 
caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  ano maly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in 
this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment  in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882506] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approva l by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The I nvestigator 
will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study management team, and data 
management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation of an individual subject.   All 
cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.
 
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance  and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures (SOPs ) 
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange  to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted  according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality of data,  drug accountability, compliance  with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRF s and other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any discrepancies  
or omissions will be identified  and resolved.   The study monitor will be given  access  to study-
relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655637]-site audits.  The Investigator  is expected  to 
cooperate with any audit and provide assistance  and documentation (including source data)  as 
requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  and 
have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other  parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

Procedures  for data handling (including electronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented in 
a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.   It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  Source 
documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the study and 
should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, study 
procedures, AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , including 
survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_882507]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  the 
Sponsor or its designee and regulatory  authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  records  
for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data collection  process.   The subject’s  
confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  permitted  by 
[CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655638].  The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  the 
Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data  
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882508] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol  change 
and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities and the Investigative sites who will notify the 
respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 150 sites. 
Study Population  
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_882520] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882521] -line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean is 
called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subje cts who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882522]

sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882524] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third- line agent regimen re-instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882525] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to  be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) will be used to 
achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and 
placebo).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (S AGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made  to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_882526] 24 hours following cessation of the blind ed study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug 
infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so 
subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible to 
be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte -depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882534] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP will 
be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of signif icance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the

The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_882535] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE  Sage Therapeutics  
  
27 May 2015                                                                        11  Confidential  
 pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third -line agent wean attempts prior to randomization 
(one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a tr eatment responder is a subject who is successfully weaned off 
all third -line agents  and blinded study medication  prior to the end of study treatment infusion and remains 
off third -line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, and who has 
concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be b ased on the 
ITT Population.  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of 
significance.  
Anal ysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the MITT population.  Secondary endpoints will be compared 
between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT population with a hierarchical testing process 
at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will use the order of 
endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process 
will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non-
significant result.  
Secondary analyses will be repeated for the MITT population.  Summary statistics will be provided for  all 
endpoints.  Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for t reatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and number of 
previous wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third -line agents for 
primary and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pe ntobarbital use and 
number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous 
data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondar y response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under thes e assumptions, 
with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be >90% 
power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care  Society  defines 
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or r ecurrent  seizures  
without regaining  consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE include preexistin g epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease (in adults), 
electrolyte and metabolic  disturbances, anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is 
associated  with  substa ntial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655328], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The incidence of SE in the elderly  popula tion is at least twice  
that in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  
population, which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE (Chapman, Smith et al. 
2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19- year retrospective study in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota (Hesdorffer, 
Logroscino et al. 1998 ) and a 2-y ear prospective study  in Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock 
et al. 1995 ), respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitud e, 
ranging  between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000; Knake, Rosenow et 
al. 2001) .  It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there  are as many  as 150,000 
cases  of SE (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam  (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012) , which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an 
IV anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED)  such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; 
Shorvon 2011; Hocker, B
ritton et al. 2013) . 
Approxi mately  20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - 
line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70-80% of patients  who 
receive second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is 
diagnosed as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to 
terminate  the seizure activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE 
patients  are immediately  admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882548] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patie nt is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656],  
informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14849] R SE 
Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require 
the administration  of a second -line AED  therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these  
patients  treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , 
leaving  up to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractory  to second -line therapy.   
Based  on the previously- cited  estimate d incidence in the US, this means  that there are up to 42,000 
incident cases  of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE 
After [ADDRESS_882549] -line therapy .  If the 
weaning  is unsuccessful (neuronal activity  has not returned  to normal),  the third -line agent is re-
administered  or a different third -line agent  is started,  and the patient  is considered  to be in super-
refractory  status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (SRSE)  (Chapman, Smith et al. 2001; Shorvon 2011; Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  SAGE -[ADDRESS_882550] treatment.  In this protocol, the term “RSE that has failed standard 
treatment” is deemed to be equivalent to the term “ SRSE ” and the two may be used 
interchangeably . 
3.3.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655401], mainly  because the diagnostic codes  used for SE 
do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker, 
Britton et al. 2013; Sutter, Marsch et al. 2013) .  More  detailed  epi[INVESTIGATOR_655402]- refractory .  A 
recent review of ICU discharge data in the [LOCATION_003] suggests an annual incidence of approximately 
35,000, based on patients who required at least three days in the ICU for SE  [Sage data on file].  
3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortalit y depending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines  the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from  SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous, resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse  effects  of the current  
standard treatments.   Prognosis worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer  duration of SE, i.e.

 with SE that develops into RSE or SRSE  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010) , and with longer duration 
of medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  
need  to improve upon the current  standard  of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits (Neligan and Shorvon 2010; Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) .  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional 
outcome.

Cryptogenic/Idiopathic  5-[ADDRESS_882551] of diagnosis and treatment  of underlying medical  
conditions, adding and changing  anti-seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning  from  IV 
anesthetic agents.  Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications  of extended  periods of anesthesia or unconsciousness 
(Shorvon 2011) .  
Currently,  there  are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control SRSE  has 
only been  studied in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without controls 
(Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is optim al nor on an 
optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic  instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requiring 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882552] -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective  in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse effect  profile,  comprising 
decreased  blood pressure  and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_138503] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The 
ability  to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents  as quickly as possible is therefore  
paramount, and an adjunct  to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  
and supports their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition to 
the therapeutic armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882553].  
3.4. SAGE -547 Injection  
Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  ( allopregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment  of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard  treatment.   SAGE -547 
Injection  is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP 
and 250 mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for 
Injection, USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentrat ion of approximately 
1.67 mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenously.  
3.4.1. Scientific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance 
occurring  in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the 
central  nervous system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  
types  of GABA  receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A 
receptors  are macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  
specific binding sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators,  including barbiturates,  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic  agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes 
significantly  to the normal  termination  of a seizure  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is  
a positive allosteric  modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to 
control as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift 
from  inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-
D-aspartic  acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  As prolonged e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_655336] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic 
inhibition, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A 
neurotransmission become less  effective the  longer SE  continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process  of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes 
to the reduction of inhibitory  transmission  observed  during prolonged seizures (Kapur and

27 May 2015                                                                        31  Confidential  
 Macdonald 1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynaptic as well as intrasynaptic  
GABA A receptors;  extrasynaptic  receptors  remain  active with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting  in 
a putative mode of action  for SAGE -[ADDRESS_882554] 
suppression ( Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expa nded  access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for S AGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or 
placebo), during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the 
Phase [ADDRESS_882555] -line agents while being 
administered SAGE -547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -
547 at a higher dose, which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the 
Phase 2 s tudy.  Follow up of subjects is for 21 – [ADDRESS_882556]  of care 
for SRSE,  a serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  
compri se 20 from  the ongoing Phase 2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 
subjects who received EIND  treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled  by [CONTACT_572379],  without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or 
death  during therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the 
efficacy  assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) 
subjects  with SRSE  who completed  the SAGE-[ADDRESS_882557] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying e
tiologies of SE in the 547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_882558] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the 
published rates. None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, 
organophosphate toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655338], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non-fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these 
events to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects 
(20%) experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_882559] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data 
on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents  are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment 
guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active contr ol arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655529], mandating the use of 
prospective, concurrent control data;

27 May 2015                                                                        33  Confidential  
 • Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_882560] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is 
associated with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential 
ethical concern about administering placebo to desperate ly ill patients who have often 
exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: 
firstly all patients receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be 
weaned from their third -line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be 
administered open- label SAGE -[ADDRESS_882561] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety signals although two -thirds of 
subjects experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid 
conditions.  The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For  these reasons, the standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882562] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the hi gher maintenance dose 
are 102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open -label infusion 
of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882563] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of S AGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_882564] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical  study is optional. 
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures in men and women up to [ADDRESS_882565] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation 
(recorded as  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild 
headache (Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ).  No SAEs were  reported 
(Navarro, Kaddouz et al. 2003; Timby, B algard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007; Kask, 
Backstrom et al. 2008; Kask, Backstrom  et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the 
reduced consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously- reported events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subjects 
(20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the 
context of published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882566] a high risk of severe morbidity (Neligan and 
Shorvon 2010 ).  The subjects  treated  with SAGE -[ADDRESS_882567]  (IRB)  where  the 
study is conducted. The IRB will meet  all FDA  requirements  governing IRBs  (CFR,  Title  21, Part 
56). 
4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and 
must also  conduct the study in accordance  with  local  regulations. 
4.3. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to give consent.  Therefore, consent 
will be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative  (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study,  written inf ormed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of  consent to be obtained will depend  on the condition of the subject as determined by 
[CONTACT_45822].  The informed consent form (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB,  
must follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject ’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated 
study monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities.  
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for P harmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components 
of the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject 
chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e 
a specific consent form for the genetic component of the study in addition to the main study 
consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given 
and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their decision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882568] Data P rotection Relative to Phar macogenomics  
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, 
their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preser ve confidentiality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in 
all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882574]- line agent or agents will be weaned.  This wean is called the qualifying wean 
(QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for approximately three weeks to 
collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_655530] s, adverse event, and outcome data  (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who 
fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882575]’s LAR.  The subject will then be 
administered one or more third- line agent at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression 
pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882576] be randomized and the blinded study 
drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists 
and monitors will not be able to asc ertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents 
starting at hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by [CONTACT_186613] (H) [ADDRESS_882577] evidence of physiologic brain 
activity (average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two microvolt s) at the end of the 
primary endpoint assessment period as determined by [CONTACT_655631] a success.  
Details of the assessments and time points are provided in the schedule of assessments (Table 1,  
Table 2 and Table 3 ). 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent 
regimen before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within [ADDRESS_882578] 
be confirmed in writing by [CONTACT_655610]- label infusion starting.  The blind 
will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects 
who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher 
dose.

 approved by [CONTACT_1026]/Independent Ethics  Committees  (IECs),  and in accordance with ICH 
Guidelines on GCP  standards. 
7.3. Blinding and Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects t o be 
randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  A dynamic randomization 
(minimization algorithm) will be used to achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and 
between the treatment groups ( SAGE -547 and placebo).  Details of the dynamic randomization 
process will be included in the SAP.   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatment products (SAGE -547 
and placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, 
pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
The second infusion of SAGE -547 will be administered on an open label basis to subjects who 
failed the primary endpoint wean.

in genetic research, subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, n ot have received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882582]  Withdrawal  / Study  Termination  
8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug disconti nuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an  AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw  subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  
withdrawal, including  the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  
from Visit 12/12R .  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo 
study procedures as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the  
reason for subje ct withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than planned, subjects should continue t o be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  
period. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882583] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwil ling or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to 
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  
reasons including  the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  
subjects, administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage 
Therapeutics  will provide written  notification to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must 
promptly notify their IRB and initiate  withdrawal  procedures for participating  subjects.

9.1. Identity of  Investigational Product  
SAGE -547 Injection (allopregnanolone) 
9.2. Clinical Supplie s 
9.2.1. SAGE -547 
Adequate supplies of SAGE -547 Injection and materials for intravenous administration will be  
provided to each site.   
SAGE -547 Injection is a clear, colorless sterile solution of  allopregnanolone intended for 
intravenous injection.  SAGE -547 Injection  is an aqueous solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in 
250 mg/mL  Captisol® (betadex  sulfobutyl- ether sodium, NF).  It is presented either un- buffered or

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882589] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_882590] igator at any time during the study.  All concomitant medications , procedures, and 
treatments  should be  documented throughout the study from  Screening  through Visit 12/12R  
and recorded  on the  eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_882591] “failed 
first-line agents” and “failed secon d-line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant Third- Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient took for entry into the study .  Detail s will 
include the name [CONTACT_18467], the start and stop dates and times, an d, after consent, the doses with 
start and stop times for each change in dose.  This recording of third- line agents will continue 
throughout the study until Visit 12/12R. 
In additio n, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this 
third -line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur 
after the TW up  to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to tolerate the ventilator.  For subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred agent unless there are contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the 
third -line agent when it is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as 
ventilator support  or for another purpose.  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify 
that the doses used are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The 
doses used for ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used 
for seizure or burst suppression , and use of these third- line agents for these other purpose s does 
not constitute a wean failure under this protocol. 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop 
dates and ti mes of all dose changes.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882592] suppression during the  24 hours after 
the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882593] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ) to be deemed to be successes.   All subjects who fail to complete their infusion of 
randomized treatment or do not have at least one attempt  during study treatment  to wean off all 
third -line agents will be consider ed as “failures” for the primary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a seizure or burst 
suppression EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as 
continuous intravenous infusions of pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at 
maintenance doses alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the 
EEG.  The following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents t hat may be 
expected alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses 
than these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the [ADDRESS_882594] 12 
hours of the blinded study drug infusion, they wi ll be considered to be screen failures /protocol 
violators and will exit the study.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be guided by [CONTACT_655612], and the clinical judgment of the investigator, and will always be primarily 
done in the best medical interests of the subject.  Advice about weaning may be sought from the 
Clinical Standar dization Team, a group of fellow investigators with experience of performing 
clinical trials in subjects with SRSE.   The Clinical Standardization Team will be able to review 
EEGs in real time related to key study timepoints (qualifying wean, terminal wean, and the period  
after the end of the blinded study drug infusion) in order to provide advice about compliance with the Clinical Standardization Guidelines.  
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882595] -line agent; the other w eans (OW), which 
are the weans of the third -line agents other than the TW if the subject is on more than one third-
line agent.   The guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third 
line agents that take place after the TW for the first blinded study drug infusion or the second 
open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent  bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third -line agent being weaned should be re -instituted at a dose 
that was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that 
third -line agent or be administered  in addition to the third -line agent that is the subject of 
the wean attempt.  
• Investigators should allow 24 hours to lapse after the end of a “successful” qualifying wean 
before finally declaring the QW a success.  If a third -line agent needs to be re -instituted 
within that [ADDRESS_882596] may then be randomized in the 
study.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should not begin before H49 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third- line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882597] -line agent being weaned 
should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure 
activity abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the fi rst should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882598] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, 
with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after st arting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• The TW is defined as the wean of the last third- line agent.  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
27 May 2015                                                                         51  Confidential  
 • If the subject is on one third- line agent, the TW should not begin before H49 and should 
begin no later than H97 after starting administration of study drug or starting the open -label 
infusion of SAGE -547.  If the subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should ideally 
begin as soon as the last OW is complete but in any case not later t han H97 after starting 
the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -
547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 
hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as  possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third -line agent being weaned should be re -instituted at a dose 
that was controlling seizures, or a new third -line agent should be started to replace  this 
third -line agent  or be administered  in addition to the third -line agent that is the subject of 
the wean attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
admin istration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug 
or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_882599]- line 
agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EEGs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG 
being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A six -hour duration EEG will  be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent 
is to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_882600] -line agent(s) or the decision to re -institute a third -line 
agent(s) at doses intended to induce burst suppression. 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to five hours after the start of the blinded infusion.  This will be called the BIEEG.  The intent of 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882601] that the loading dose of blinded study drug infusion has on the 
EEG.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third -line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_882602] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs. 
• EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failu res on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882603] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.[ADDRESS_882604] arting the open-label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of 
the 24- hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of 
study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882605].  In some cases 
(the TAEEG a nd PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken 
to service the different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de- identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG 
and the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated 
(CEEG, QWEEG, BIEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655345], as follows: 
• For the CEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655346].  
• For the QWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the qualifying wean (inability to wean off the third-line agent or the third- line agent reinstituted 
for burst suppression during the qualifying  wean).  
• For the BIEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655348]. 
• For the TWEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655349] a failure on the terminal wean (inability to wean off the third -line agent or the third -line agent reinstituted 
for burst suppression during the terminal wean).  
• For the TAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655350] a failure on the 
primary endpoint (inability to wean off the third -line agent by  [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882606] suppression before the end of the 
SAGE -547 infusion). 
• For the PAEEG, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655440] a failure on the 
primary endpoint (inability to wean off the third -line agent by [CONTACT_655613] -[ADDRESS_882607] suppression in the 24 hours following 
the end of the SAGE-547 infusion). 
A maximum of  nine EEG records for each subject will be collected and stored  centrally ; of these, 
the following  will be read centrally  to confirm the PI [INVESTIGATOR_655470]- response to 
blinded study medication, and confirm the presence of physiologic brain activity at the end of the primary endpoint assessment period ( average EEG power at the end of Visit 9 of more than two 
microvolts ). 
• All subjects will have the CEEG and QWEEG collected and stored, and the QWEEG read; 
• Those subjects who are successful on the QW will not have any further EEGs collected, stored, or read;

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The clinical global impression scales are often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to 
integrate several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition.  Both the 
CGI-Severity  (Question 1, CGI-S) and the  CGI-Improvement ( Question 2, CGI-I) employ  a 7-
point Likert scale measuring  severity  of the disease state in the subject and improvement, 
respectively.  All severity  assessments after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882608] question on the scale will not be 
employed in this trial, and where the scale states “mental illness”, this means “physical illness” in 
this trial.  
The CGI -S will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_882609] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .  The CGI -I will be 
evaluated at Visit 12 or 12R.

according  to Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3  (Schedules of Assessments) . 
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be collect ed after informed  consent  has been  signed  and prior  to study -specific  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882614] preparation  for SAGE -547 
administration  and through  Visit 12  or Visit 12 R.  AEs will be coded  using the Medical  
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA™) coding system (current version). See 
Section  14 for additiona l details.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be taken for hematology, and serum chemistry  and GFR will be calcula ted at : 
• Visit 1  and then at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/ - 2 hours) relative to the start of the 
first infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882615] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
• Blood samples will be taken at Visit 11 or Visit 11R for serum chemistry (renal panel 
only).  
Urine samples (20 ml) will be taken for urinalysis and urine NAG analysis at:  
• Visit 1  and at Hour 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 (all +/- 2 hours)  relative to the start of the first 
infusion of study drug, and to the start of the second infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882616] qualify for the second infusion of SAGE-547. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be 
based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of 
care.   GFR will be calculated using values from local laboratory tests.  
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment 
about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those 
that prompt an intervention and will be recorded as adverse events.

aminotransferase (AST),  bicarbonate, bilirubin (total), blood urea nitrogen  (BUN), calcium,  
chloride, creatine kinase, lipase, creatinine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total protein, and 
glucose.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnan cy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate history of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women 
may not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_882617] will be ineligible 
for study  partic ipation.

11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study  due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -
family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the 
GABA receptor (e.g. GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes 
associated with the production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extraction and coding:  DNA will b e extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information within Sage Therapeutics or at an y designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific 
analysis.  No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person 
(internal or external to Sage Therapeutics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link w ill be used to identify 
relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, 
allow regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary 
blood samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses 
are possible, a maximum storage period of  [ADDRESS_882621] visit has been 
reached, or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma and urine analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical l ab 
with a validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for 
important SAGE -547 metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following time points 
relative to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, 
+24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655533]), +152,  
and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12,

(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655533]), +152, and +160 hours after the start 
of the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from the arm contralateral to that used for drug administration.  Drawing samples from peripheral arterial or venous lines or from a central line is permissible.  PK 
collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The allowed time window for all 
samples is : pre-dose in the two hours prior to starting the infusion of study drug; samples up to and 
including 1h, +/- 5 minutes ; subsequent samples, +/ - [ADDRESS_882622] samples taken as outlined above: subjects receiving SAGE -[ADDRESS_882623] samples analyzed to investigate endogenous allopregnanolone and metabolite concentrations, as well as Captisol
® concentrations; experience with the plas ma 
concentration data will determine if and which placebo samples are analyzed.  
Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_882624] having two 
infusions of study drug will be 99 ml (66 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882625] in the study is undergoing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_655367], they or their LAR will be asked if they would consent for a sample to be retained

Full details of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whet her there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information w ill be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the  number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
For those subjects discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655308] 12/12R, the following questions will be 
asked:  
• On what study day was the subject discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? 
• What type of facility was the subject discharged to (another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a rehabilitation center, 
a supported care facility, home, other)? 
• How many days did the subject stay in this facility?  
The following questions will be answered regarding the stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: 
• Was the subject still in the ICU at the end of Visit 10/10R? 
• If the FOUR Score was >12 at Visit 10/10R and the subject was in the ICU at Visit 10/10R, 
what was the reason for the subject not being discharged from the ICU (underlying disease, ICU comorbidity, no available bed elsewhere, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], other)? 
• Was the subject still an in -patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655370] 12/12R?

[IP_ADDRESS]. STESS  
The STESS will be assessed during Visit 1 in order to assess the severity of the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern). 
The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common assessment  scale  used to standardize descriptions  of the 
objective degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It 
was first used in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975)  and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of 
rehabilitation  to return  to work  and everyday  life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups: 
• Death  
• Persistent  vegetative state 
• Severe disability  
• Moderate disability   
• Good recovery 
The GOS will be a ssessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject receives  
from  caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally  
be grouped into five ranked  categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  
Supervision, Full-Time  Indirect  Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was 
designed  to be rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with the subject  and an informant who has 
observed at first hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is 
 a 
one-step procedure in which  the clinician  assigns the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   
Ratings  are based  on the level  of supervision received,  not on how much  supervision a subject  is 
judged or predicted  to need. 
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882627] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407].

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and 
functional dependence due to neurological insult such as stroke in adults .  The 7-point scale (0 – 6) 
denotes functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The 
Modified Rankin Scale  – 9Q is a shortened version consisting of 9 questions that reliably  
determines  the mRS  score  and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the 
rater base to non- medically  trained  personnel (Patel, Rao et al. 2012) .  The assessment  is a web-
based  tool in the public domain with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at 
www.modifiedrankin.com. 
The mRS will be assessed at Visit 1 and at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_882628] may be performed at any time within the specified 24 -hour period.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
27 May 2015                                                                         70  Confidential  
 13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor 
will be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical 
adjustment will be made to th e level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  
A detailed description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter. 
13.1.2. Study Populations  
The Safety Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded study 
medication initiated . Subjects will be classified according to actual treatment.  This analysis 
population will be used for all safety analyses.   
The Intent to  Treat Population is defined as  all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded 
study medication initiated.  Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment.  This 
analysis population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to we an was because seizures were not controlled . 
Subjects will be classified according to randomized treatment. This analysis population will be 
used for sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and select secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Narratives will be p repared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study 
medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the 
cause of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non-comple tion of the 
infusion or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655675] .  Acceptable reasons for 
defining a subject as MITT ineligible  include death or withdrawal of consent due to progression of 
the underlying cause of SE or comorbid conditions, unless the cause of death or progression of 
disease were thought by [CONTACT_093], sponsor, or DSMB to be related to study drug. 
The Per–Protocol (PP) Population  is defined as a subset of the MITT population but will 
exclude data from all subjects with significant protocol violations or deviations.  Subjects will be 
classified according to actual treatment received.  This data set will be used for sensitivity a nalyses 
to examine the robustness of results for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints . 
The Pharmacokinetics Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of 
blinded SAGE- [ADDRESS_882638] deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variable and frequency and percentage for categor ical variables.  
13.1.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment (see Section 11.1.1 for definition of primary endpoint) 
between SAGE -547 treated subjects and placebo treated subjects will be performed on the ITT 
population using a Cochra n-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with variables for treatment, 
concomitant pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts 
prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  The CMH general association statistic  and its 
associated p- value will be presented. The comparison of treatment response rates will be 
conducted at the 5% level of significance.   To confirm the CMH results, a permutation test will 
also be conducted.   
An additional  analysis of the primary endpoint will also be performed on the MITT population.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the ITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the ITT 
population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of signi ficance.  The analysis of 
secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, 
the firs t secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue 
until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non -significant result.  The 
analysis of the secondary endpoints will also be performed on the MITT population.  Summary 
statistics will be provided for all endpoints.   Categorical endpoints ( change from baseline in CGI, 
secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655422]) will be evaluated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with variables for 
treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  Analysis of 
continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third line agents for primary and secondary 
response, number  of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed 
using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and number 
of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous 
data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882639] 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for missing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a secured database within Sage 
Therap eutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the 
samples.   Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component 
of the study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be 
obtained to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis P lan will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any genetic 
research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response 
for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups. 
13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc intervals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_882640] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected t o exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG (main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidia ry analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG 
(exploratory analysis).

 13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 70 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be >90% power for detecting a significant difference between treatment 
groups at a 5% level of significance. Randomization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_655676] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one 
vs two  or more).    
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study.  The 
SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.   Any deviations from or changes to the 
SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the final clinical study report. 
 
 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882641] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investigator responsibilities  regarding the ide ntification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting  of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655677]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Form.  Any clinically  significant  deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  
clinical findings are considered an AE and must  be recorded on the  Adve rse Event Form, unless 
otherwise stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs considered not related to study drug will be followed until resolution or until 
Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must b e completed with as much  
information as possible and submitted in the time  frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When 
new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the 
electronic SAE  eCRF should be updated within [ADDRESS_882642] was an  outpatient at the 
time of the SAE and was  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy  of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (e.g., 
admission report, laboratory  test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be included 
as part of the subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

 14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state.  
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a know n response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  admin istered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign or 
symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, but is not hazardous to health; prescription 
drug therapy may be employed to treat the AE . 
For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity and represented a definite hazard to health; 
prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655379].  
For unconscious  subjects, this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective  
action.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action  Taken  with  Investigational Drug  
None  Study  medication  was continued  without  change .  
Discontinued  Study  medication  was terminated . 
Dose  adjusted  Study  medication  dose/infusion  rate was changed  and then continued  per protocol . 
Interrupted  Study  medication  was interrupted and then continued  per protocol . 
Unknown  The action  taken  with regard  to study  medication  is unknown. 
Not applicable   Administration  of study  medi cation  was not ongoing .

 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse even ts in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the ad ministration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report  that information  
in an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess the placebo response rate at the time of the interim analysis to 
determine final sample size .  In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have 
access to un -blinded safety data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will  be described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study 
treatment  that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before  submitting  an 
IND safety  report, the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) 
suspected  adverse reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the 
definitions, it should not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the 
available information  and decide whether  there  is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the 
adverse  event  and, therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there is a serious and unexpect ed suspected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the 
safety of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_882644] medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.

 14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there is a reasonable  possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable  possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more  severe  form,  might  
have caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disability  
• A congenital  anomal y/birth  defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  
in this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not 
result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug  dependency or  drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure  or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs or as anticipated  from  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882645] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However,  if the subject is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The 
Investigator will not unblind the me dical monitor during that discussion.  The process of 
unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study 
management team, and data management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation 
of an individual s ubject.   All cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way 
that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investiga tors and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures  (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange to visit the Investigator at regular  interv als during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality  of data,  drug accountability, compliance with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the inve stigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  an d other data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any 
discrepancies  or omissions will be identified  and resolved.  The study monitor  will be given  access  
to study- relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data 
verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655678]-site audits.   The Investigator is 
expected  to cooperate with any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including source 
data)  as requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage  of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  
and have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other parties  involved

 15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including elect ronic data)  used in this protocol will be documented 
in a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  
Source documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the 
study and should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administration, 
study procedures,  AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , 
including survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
require ments.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_882646]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  
the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  
records  for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data  collection  process.  The  
subject’s  confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  
permitted  by [CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655679].   The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  
the Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data 
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, 
other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882647] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol 
change and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities  and the Investigative sites who will 
notify the respective IRB,  as appropriate.

 The study  will randomize 140 subjects at up to 150 sites. 
Study Population  
Subjects will be aged two years or more, in SRSE1 (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria Section  8.1), and 
being managed in an intensive care setting . 
Duration of Subject Involvement 
Individual subject participation will be up to [ADDRESS_882659] suppression.  These subjects are unlikely to be able to consent themselves for the 
study due to coma or mental incapacity from the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], and so consent will be obtained from 
their legally authorized representative (LAR) .   Subjects will be administered one or more third -line agents 
at a dose sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882660]- line agent or agents will be weaned.   This wean is 
called the qualifying wean (QW), and subjects who are successfully weaned will be followed for 
approximately three weeks to collect medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data .  
Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third -line agent regimen re -instituted at doses 
intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE-[ADDRESS_882661] -

Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882662]’s LAR.  The subject will then be administered one or more third- line agent at a dose 
sufficient to maintain a burst suppression pattern on the EEG for [ADDRESS_882663] medication, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618339], adverse event, and outcome data  (see 
Table 3 ).  Subjects who fail the QW will have the same or a different third- line agent regimen re -instituted 
at doses intended to result in EEG burst suppression and will be randomized to concomitant SAGE -[ADDRESS_882664] be randomized and the blinded study drug 
infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the QW. 
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be randomized to 
SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to 
randomization (one vs two or more).  A dynamic randomization (minimization algorithm) will be used to 
achieve 1:1 balance across the stratification  factors and between the treatment groups (SAGE -547 and 
placeb o).   
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAGE -547 and placebo) 
being indistinguishable so that subject s, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will 
not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made to wean the subject off all third -line agents starting at 
hour (H) 49 of the blinded study treatment infusion, with the aim of completing all weans by h our (H) [ADDRESS_882665] 24 hours following cessation of the blinded study 
medication  infusion, and concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  Details of 
the assessments and time points are  provided in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2) . 
Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent regimen 
before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the blinded study drug infusion will be eligible to r eceive an open -label infusion of SAGE -
547 at a dose higher than that 
administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained for all subjects in the study, so 
subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who failed on placebo will all subsequently be eligible to 
be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.  
Visit Schedule  
The visit schedule and an overview of events at each visit is provided in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3  
Schedule of Assessments .  
Study Objectives  
Primary  objective: 
To determine the response to a 144-hour (6 day) continuous intravenous infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882666] 24 hours  after the end of the SAGE -547 or placebo infusion  
(primary response). 
Secondary objectives : 
1. To compare between SAGE -[ADDRESS_882667] suppression up to Visit 
12; 
2. To compare between SAGE -[ADDRESS_882668] infusion of SAGE -547 or placebo; 
3. To compare between SAGE -547 and placebo t he time between meeting the secondary response 
endpoint, defined in (2) above, and the re -institu tion of any third -line agent for seizure or burst 
suppression up to Visit 12; 
4. To compare the change in the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI)  between SAGE -547 and 
placebo up to Visit 12; 
5. To determine the number of days after the end of the first infusion of study drug that the subject 
does not have status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], up to Visit 12 ; 
6. To determine the number of days after the end of the first infusion of study drug that the subject 
does not have seizures (convulsive and non-convulsive) up to Visit 12; 
7. To determine the number of separate epi[INVESTIGATOR_655306] 12 ; 
8. To determine the proportion of subjects with a new diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655307] r Visit 11 . 
Safety objectives : 
To determine the safety and tolerability of a 144-hour infusion of SAGE -547 in four groups of subjects 
with SRSE  (one infusion of SAGE -547, one infusion of placebo, one infusion of placebo followed by [CONTACT_655592]-547, and two infusions of SAGE-547) via: 
a. Adverse events and medications; 
b. Laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) ; 
c. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, oxygen saturation, 
weight ); 
d. ECG parameters ; 
e. Mortality.  
Other  objectives : 
1. To evaluate the impact of retreatment with a higher dose SAGE -547 infusion in subjects who

 c. fulminant hepatic failure;  
d. no reasonable expectation of recovery (for instance, a likely outcome is persistent vegetative 
state)  or life -expectancy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], of less than 30 days;

6. Subjects who are being administered more than three third -line agents concomitantly  or in whom 
the qualifying wean cannot be completed  within [ADDRESS_882670] been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days; the 
exception to this is that participation in the Established Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655313] [ADDRESS_882671] been enrolled in this trial or any other trial employing SAGE -547 pre viously 
(i.e., subjects may not withdraw or complete and then re- enroll).  
Pharmacogenetic Research  
In addition to fulfilling all of the selection criteria described above, for inclusion in genetic research, 
subjects will also need to provide specific informed consent for genetic sampling and analyses, not have 
received a non -leukocyte- depleted transfusion within [ADDRESS_882672] had a previous allogenic bone 
marrow transplant. 
Statistical Analysis  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of  the analyses to be performed in the study.  The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  All deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the SAP and will be summarized in the final clinical study 
report.  
Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_655594] -
estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor will be kept 
uninformed of the respo nse rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical adjustment will be made 
to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  A detailed description of the 
interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The analysis of response to treatment between SAGE -[ADDRESS_882673] with variables for treatment, concomitant 
pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization 
(one vs two or more).  In this analysis, a treatment responder is a subject who is successfully weaned off 
all third -line agents  and blinded study medication  prior to the end of study treatment infusion and remains 
off third -line agents for at least 24 hours  following cessation of the blinded study medication, and who has 
concurrent signs of physiologic brain activity  as determined by [CONTACT_66594] .  The analysis will be b ased on the 
MITT Population .  The comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of

 significance.  
Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the MITT  
population with a hierarchical testing process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis of secondary 
efficacy endpoints will use the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section.  Assuming there is a 
significant difference between groups in the primar y endpoint, the first secondary endpoint will be 
compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or 
one of the analyses yields a non -significant result.  Summary statistics will be provided for all endpoints.  
Categorical endpoints ( change from Baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655536]) will be evaluated via Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel analysis with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and number of previous 
wean attempts .  Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third -line agents for primary 
and secondary response, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and 
number of previous wean attempts .  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the continuous 
data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population which is defined as all 
subjects who at least initiated the infusion with blinded study treatment. 
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for 
those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated with SAGE -547.  Separate summaries will be 
derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo.  Summary 
statistics will be presented  for subjects who were QW successes.  
Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to S AGE -547 treatment 
and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, 
with 63 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 63 subjects randomized to placebo, there would be 90% 
power for detecting a significant d ifference between groups  at a 5% level of significance.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third- line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).

 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655326]  (SE) is a life-threatening  seizure condition in which  the brain  is in a state of 
persistent  seizure triggered  by [CONTACT_655597].   The Neurocritical  Care  Society  defines 
SE as one continuous unremitting  seizure lasting  longer than five minutes  or recurrent  seizures  
without regaining  consciousness between  seizures  for greater  than five minutes  (Brophy, Bell et 
al. 2012) .  Common causes  of SE include preexisting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  cerebrovascular  disease (in adults), 
electrolyte and metabolic  disturbances, anoxia,  encephalopathies,  head  trauma,  high fever  (in 
children, especially  in the first year of life) and drug or substance intoxication.   SE is 
associated  with  substantial morbidity and mortality.  
3.1.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655327],  sex, age, and race influence the epi[INVESTIGATOR_655328], whose incidence has a bimodal 
distribution , peaking  in infants/ young children and the elderly  (Hauser 1990; DeLorenzo, Pellock et 
al. 1995; Wu, Shek et al. 2002) .  The incidence of SE in the elderly  population is at least twice  
that in the general  population.  Concurrent medical  conditions often  exist  in the elderly  
population, which  can complicate  therapy  and worsen  the prognosis of SE (Chapman, Smith et al. 
2001) . 
The annual incidence of SE in the US is generally  quoted to be within  the range  of 18/100,000 to 
61/100,000, based  on a 19- year retrospective study in [COMPANY_002]ster,  Minnesota (Hesdorffer, 
Logroscino et al. 1998 ) and a 2-year prospective study  in Richmond, Virginia  (DeLorenzo, Pellock 
et al. 1995 ), respectively.   Two studies  from  Europe give annual  incidences of a similar  magnitude, 
ranging  between  9.9/100,000 and 15.8/100,000 (Coeytaux, Jallon et al. 2000; Knake, Rosenow et 
al. 2001) .  It is thus  estimated  that in the United  States  each year there  are as many  as 150,000 
cases  of SE (DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) .  
3.2. Refractory  SE 
When  a patient  begins to seize,  the emergency  medical  technician  will administer  a first-line 
intravenous (IV) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (BDZ),  such as diazepam,  lorazepam  or midazolam  (Silbergleit, 
Durkalski et al. 2012) , which  is done either  at the scene of the seizure or in the ambulance.   If this 
is unsuccessful at abating  the seizure,  additional doses of the first-line therapy  will be 
administered  in the emergency  room.  Of those patients  on first-line therapy,  approximately  
35% will not respond and will require  the administration  of a second -line therapy,  which  is an 
IV anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED)  such as phenytoin or valproic acid (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; 
Shorvon 2011; Hocker, Bri
tton et al. 2013) . 
Approximately 20-30% of patients  refractory to first -line treatment will respond to the second - 
line agent  (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , leaving  up to approximately 70-80% of patients  who 
receive second -line therapy refractory  to that therapy . 
If a patient’s  SE continues after administration  of BDZs  and AEDs , the subject  is 
diagnosed as having refractory status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (RSE), which  must be treated  quickly to 
terminate  the seizure activity,  maintain  the patient’s  airway,  and prevent cerebral  damage.   RSE 
patients  are immediately  admitted  to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  and placed  in a 
Protocol 547-SSE-[ADDRESS_882687] -line agents  (Brophy, Bell et al. 2012) . 
The RSE patient  is continually monitored using electroencephalography  (EEG)  to ensure burst 
suppression is achieved.   Burst  suppression is a pattern  of brain  waves  seen on an EEG,  
characterized  by [CONTACT_655656],  
informing medical  personnel of the effectiveness  of the medically -induced coma.   The goal of 
burst suppression is to allow  the brain  and corresponding neuronal tissue  to restore  function and 
reset  to normal pre- seizure levels.  
3.2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655329]-line therapy,  approximately  35% will not respond and will require 
the administration  of a second -line AED  therapy.   In turn, approximately  20 – 30% of these  
patients  treated  with AEDs  will respond to the second -line agent (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010) , 
leaving  up to 28% of the total estimated SE patient  population refractor y to second -line therapy.   
Based  on the previously- cited  estimated  incidence in the US, this means  that there are up to 42,000 
incident cases  of RSE  in the [LOCATION_003],  annually ( DeLorenzo, Pellock et al. 1995) . 
3.3. Super -refractory  SE

do not generally  differentiate  its nature as responding or refractory  to treatment.   Based  on the 
variable reporting  of outcomes data,  the incident cases  of SRSE  could represent  between  one and 
two-third s of the RSE patients (Novy, Logroscino et al. 2010; Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012; Hocker,

3.3.2. Outcomes  of SRSE  
SE has varying degrees  of mortality  de pending on the underlying etiologies.   Table 4 outlines  the 
acute mortality  in patients  with SE by [CONTACT_143885]  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010 ). The mortality  rate of 
SRSE  is estimated  to be 30% to 50% using current  standard  of care.   
The causes  of death  from  SE (and  therefore  SRSE)  are heterogeneous, resulting  from  neuronal 
cell death,  complications  of underlying medical  conditions, or adverse  effects  of the current  
standard treatments.   Prognosis worsens  and mortality  increases  with longer  duration of SE, i.e.

of medically -induced  coma (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  There is an obvious unmet medical  
need  to improve upon the current  standard  of care treatment  regimens.  
Morbidity is high and survivors  have outcomes  ranging from  poor function to vegetative state 
(Shorvon 2011) .  Approximately one third  of patients  with RSE and SRSE  will recover,  but with 
chronic neurologic or other  deficits  (Neligan and Shorvon 2010; Hocker , Britton et al. 2013) .  In 
all, it is estimated  that less than 25-30% of all SRSE  patients  have a favorable functional 
outcome.

conditions, adding and changing  anti-seizure drugs, and repeated  attempts  at weaning  from  IV 
anesthetic agents.  Treatment  of SRSE  has three aims: 
• to prevent excitotoxicity,  which  begins within  24 hours of SE  onset; 
• to prevent cerebral  damage  by [CONTACT_655657]; 
• to prevent the complications  of extended  periods of anesthesia or unconsciousness 
(Shorvon 2011) .  
Currently,  there  are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655333] .  The 
primary  drugs  used to induce coma are continuously infused IV anesthetics  such as propofol, 
midazolam,  or pentobarbital, known as third -line agents.   Use of these drugs  to control SRSE  has 
only been  studied in small retrospective reviews  or small prospective studies without controls 
(Hocker, Britton et al. 2013) therefore  there  is no agreement  on which  drug is optimal nor on an 
optimal dosing regimen  for the treatments  that are used. 
The most common adverse effect  of the third -line agents is hemodynamic  instability; in addition, 
they are not universally effective,  with breakthrough seizures  and withdrawal  seizures  requir ing 
Protocol 547-SSE-[ADDRESS_882691] -line agent(s).   The drug thought to be most effective  in 
SRSE , pentobarbital,  is also associated  with the most toxic  adverse effect  profile,  comprising 
decreased  blood pressure  and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_138503] (Claassen, Hirsch et al. 2002) .  The 
ability  to wean  patients  successfully  off the third -line agents  as quickly as possible is therefore  
paramount, and an adjunct  to SRSE  treatment  that enhances the success  of the third -line agents  
and supports their  successful  weaning  in a short timeframe  would be an important addition to 
the therapeutic armamentarium.  Preliminary  clinical  data show that SAGE -[ADDRESS_882692].

Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally  occurring neuroactive steroid  formed  in the corpus 
luteum  of the ovary, adrenal  cortex  and central  nervous system  (CNS)  (Holzbauer, Birmingham et 
al. 1985 ; Paul and Purdy 1992 ; Ottander, Poromaa et al. 2005) .  It is a metabolite  of progesterone 
created  by [CONTACT_655600] 5-α reductase  and 3-α hydroxy- steroid  dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone 
is a potent  positive allosteric  modulator  of both  synaptic and  extra -synaptic GABA A receptors.  
SAGE -547 Injection  (all opregnanolone aqueous  formulation in Captisol®) is being developed for 
the treatment  of patients in RSE  who have not responded to standard  treatment.   SAGE -547 
Injection  is a solution of  5 mg/mL  allopregnanolone in Sterile Water for Injection  (SWFI),  USP 
and 250 mg/mL  betadex  sulfobutyl -ether sodium, NF.  It is further diluted with Sterile Water for 
Injection, USP (SWFI) in IV bags to achieve an allopregnanolone concentration of approximately 
1.67 mg/mL in an approximately isotonic solution and  will be administered  intravenousl y. 
3.4.1. Scientific  Rationale for SAGE -547 in  SRSE  
Ineffective recruitment  of inhibitory neurotransmission, together  with excessive neuronal 
excitation,  likely  plays  a role in the initiation  and propagation of the electrical  disturbance 
occurring  in SE.  GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid),  the major  inhibitory neurotransmitter  in the 
central  nervous system  (CNS),  is released  from  GABAergic  neurons and binds to several  
types  of GABA  receptors  (GABA A, GABA B, and GABA C) on target  neurons.  GABA A 
receptors  are macromolecular  proteins that form  a chloride ion channel  complex  and contain  
specific binding sites for GABA  and a number of allosteric  regulators,  including barbiturates,  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and some anesthetic  agents.   GABA  receptor –mediated  inhibition  contributes 
significantly  to the normal  termination  of a seizure  (Kapur and Macdonald 1997) .  SAGE -547 is  
a positive alloste ric modulator of the GABA A receptor.   
The importance of terminating  seizure activity  as soon as possible is underpi[INVESTIGATOR_655335] a growing  
body of evidence from  research  and clinical  observation that SE becomes  more  difficult to 
control as its duration increases.   It has been  postulated that this occurs  due to a mechanistic  shift 
from  inadequate GABAergic  inhibitory receptor –mediated  transmission  to excessive N- methyl-
D-aspartic  acid (NMDA)  excitatory  receptor –mediated  transmission  (Kapur and Macdonald 
1997) .  As prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_655404] a reduction of GABA A-mediated  synaptic 
inhibition, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655405] A 
neurotransmission become less  effective the  longer SE  continues. 
Furthermore,  the constitutive  process  of synaptic  GABA A receptor  internalization  is accelerated  by 
[CONTACT_655629].   These findings suggest that the rate of 
GABA A receptor  internalization  is regulated  by [CONTACT_655601],  and its acceleration  contributes 
to the reduction of inhibitory  transmission  observed  during prolonged seizures (Kapur and

 Macdonald 1997) .  Of note is that SAGE -547 binds to extrasynapt ic as well as intrasynaptic  
GABA A receptors;  extrasynaptic  receptors  remain  active with ongoing seizure activity,  resulting  in 
a putative mode of action  for SAGE -[ADDRESS_882693] 
suppression ( Shorvon and Ferlisi 2011) . 
3.4.2. SAGE -547 Clinical Program  in the Treatment  of SRSE  
The current SAGE -547 development program  includes: 
• an ongoing Phase 2 open- label  trial, Study 547- SSE-201; 
• this proposed  Phase  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, Study 547- SSE-
301; 
• a planned open -label,  expand ed access  protocol , Study 547- SSE-302; 
• a number of  EINDs  for SAGE -547 in  patients with SRSE.  
The designs of these studies are all similar, with a five to six day infusion of SAGE -547 (or 
placebo), during which time attempts are made to wean the subject off all third -line agents.  In the 
Phase 3 studies, those subjects who cannot be weaned off thir d-line agents while being 
administered SAGE -547 (or placebo) will be eligible for a second open -label infusion of SAGE -
547 at a higher dose, which is also being employed for the latter patients being enrolled in the 
Phase 2 study.  Follow up of subjects is  for 21 – [ADDRESS_882694]  of care 
for SRSE,  a serious condition with a high morbidity and mortality  rate.  These subjects  
comprise 20 from  the ongoing Phase 2 trial (71% success  rate in 12/17 evaluable subjects ) and 10 
subjects who received EIND  treatments  (78% success  rate in 7/9 evaluable subjects ). 
Successful  therapy  of SRSE  has been  defined  as “the SE is completely  controlled  by [CONTACT_572379],  without breakthrough of withdrawal  seizures,  or discontinuation due to side effects  or 
death  during therapy, ” (Ferlisi and Shorvon 2012) .  By [CONTACT_13748], which  is in accord  with the 
efficacy  assessments used in the overall  clinical  evaluation  of SAGE -547, 19 of the 26 (73%) 
subjects  with SRSE  who completed  the SAGE -[ADDRESS_882695] stated mortality rate ranges from 35% to 65%.  The 
underlying eti
ologies of SE in the  547- SAGE -[ADDRESS_882696] received SAGE -547, 6 out of 30 (2 0%) subjects, appears to be  lower than the 
publishe d rates.  None of the deaths were considered related to SAGE -547: brain tumor, 
organophosphate toxicity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], respi[INVESTIGATOR_655338], and breast cancer.  
In the Phase 2 study, 20 SAEs (15 non- fatal) have been reported in 13 (65%) subjects, and of these 
3 events in 2 subjects (10%) were considered by [CONTACT_655605] -547: 
pulmonary emboli and tracheostomy dehiscence/infection. The Sponsor did not consider these 
events to be related to SAGE -547, rather to the underlying disease states.  Four of the 20 subjects 
(20%) experienced AEs considered possibly related to SAGE -[ADDRESS_882697] -line agents, propofol, pentobarbital, and midazolam. 
Several options for a control group in Study 547- SSE-301 were considered: 
• No control group was thought  to be unacceptable since there are no reliable published data 
on success rates in this population that could be used for broad comparisons; 
• An active control was considered but found to be impractical since none of the third- line 
agents are approved for their use in SRSE, no standardized dosing regimens or treatment guidelines have been adopted for the management of SRSE, and clinicians were unlikely to 
agree which of the available third -line agents would be reserved for the active control arm;  
• Historical controls were considered but abandoned because of the practical difficulties of 
obtaining high quality data, the lack of ability to prospectively match cases, and a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_655339], mandating the  use of 
prospective, concurrent control data;

 • Comparison to standard of care alone was considered as a feasible design.  However, in a 
field where no widely adopted treatment guidelines exist, there was a concern that 
knowledge of the treatment group (SAGE -[ADDRESS_882698] of care 
alone) would alter the behavior of the investigators such that they could be more aggressive 
with weaning in the SAGE-547 group; 
• Placebo control is not without its challenges since the preliminary efficacy  data for 
SAGE -547 show that the compound exerts central pharmacological effects and is 
associated with positive outcomes in around 70% of patients.  There is therefore a potential ethical concern about administering placebo to desperately ill patients who have often 
exhausted all treatment options for SRSE.  This concern has been addressed in two ways: 
firstly all patients receive current standard of care; secondly, all subjects who fail to be 
weaned from their third -line agents at the end of the blinded infusion of study drug will be 
administered open- label SAGE -[ADDRESS_882699] dose regimen has been studied in 19 subjects  in the 547- SSE-201 Phase 2 trial ; the 
average peak plasma concentration of SAGE -547 at the end of the loading dose was approximately 
144 ng/ml.  T he average plasma concentration during the maintenance infusion was  approximately 
70 ng/ml.  At these concentrations, there were no clear safety sig nals although two- thirds of 
subjects experienced an SAE and there were four deaths , all related to the underlying comorbid 
conditions.  The standard dosing regimen was associated with an approximate 70% successful treatment outcome.  For these reasons, the  standard dosing regimen has been adopted for the initial 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882700] thus far received the higher dose regimen.  This dose 
regimen has also been well tolerated.  The average peak plasma concentrations at the end of the 
loading dose for both dosing regimens will be in the same range, as the loading dose is the same for both regimens.  The average plasma concentrations observed during the higher maintenance dose are 102 ng/ml (n=2).  The rationale  for adopting the higher dose regimen as the open -label infusion 
of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882701] -line agents was not possible within 48 hours, but 
weaning was completed after the end of the infusion of SAGE -547.  For this reason, the duration of 
dosing with SAGE -547 has been increased from 120 hours (five days) in Phase 2 to 144 hours (six 
days) in this Phase [ADDRESS_882702] to individual benefit:risk.  
Participation of subjects in genetic research as part of the overall clinical study is optional.  
3.6. Benefit-R isk Evaluation  of the Present Study  
Previous reports of human administration of exogenous allopregnanolone indicate that for exposures in men and women up to [ADDRESS_882703] commonly  reported AEs  were sedation 
(recorded as  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_655340]), feelings of intoxication (like alcohol), flushing, and mild 
headache (Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007 ).  No SAEs were  reported 
(Navarro, Kaddouz et al. 2003; Timby, Balgard et al. 2006; van Broekhoven F, T et al. 2007; Kask, 
Backstrom et al. 2008; Kask, Backstrom et al. 2009; Timby, Hedstrom et al. 2011a ).  In view of the 
reduced consciousness and sedation of study subjects at entry into this protocol, none of these previously- repor ted events are likely to impact subjects in this study.   
To date, in the SAGE-547 Phase 2 study and the EIND subjects, a majority  of subjects  demonstrated 
a successful  therapy  outcome (>70%) .  The majority in the clinical trial (65%) have also experienced 
SAEs, but none has been considered related to SAGE -547 by [CONTACT_1034] (SAEs in 2 subjects (10%) 
were considered possibly related by [CONTACT_10670]).  Five deaths have been reported in 30 subje cts 
(20%), all related to the underlying cause of SRSE and not related to SAGE -547 – this is in the 
context of published mortality rates between 35% and 65%.  These preliminary  data suggest that

4.2. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The Sponsor, the Medical  Monitor, and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, 
regulations, and agreements  in this protocol and in the applicable ICH and GCP  guidelines, and 
must also  conduct the study in accordance  with  local  regulations. 
Protocol 547-SSE-[ADDRESS_882706]  Information  and Informed  Consent  
Subjects prospectively enrolled in this study  will be unable to give consent.  Therefore, consent 
will be given by [CONTACT_655606] a legally  authorized representative  (LAR) .  Written informed consent is 
required for each  subject prior to any testing  under this protocol not considered standard of  care, 
including screening  tests and evaluations.  Should a subject gain the  ability  to sufficiently  
comprehend the  situation and consent during  the course of the study,  written informed consent or 
verbal assent  will be documented as required or recommended by [CONTACT_8236]’s  IRB.   
The form of  consent to be obtained will depend  on the condition of the subject as determined by 
[CONTACT_45822].  The informed consent form (ICF), as specified by [CONTACT_977]’s  IRB,  
must follow the Protection of  Human Subjects regulations listed in the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to obtain consent and to provide the subject’s LAR with a 
copy  of the signed and dated informed consent form.  The informed consent form for subject 
participation  must also be available as  part of the subject  file for review by [CONTACT_779]’s dedicated 
study monitor or any authorized auditor of the Sponsor or regulatory authorities. 
All ICFs  used in this study  must be approved by [CONTACT_655630].  The ICF 
must not be altered  without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and the Sponsor. 
4.4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmacogenetic Sub -
study  
4.4.1. Informed Consent  for Pharmacogenetics  
The genetic component of this study is optional and subjects may participate in other components 
of the main study without having to agree to participate in the genetic component.  If subject 
chooses to participate in the genetic component of the study, the subject or LAR must sign and dat e 
a specific consent form for the genetic component of the s tudy in addition to the main study 
consent form.  The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is freely given 
and that the subject understands that they may discontinue from the genetic aspect of the study independent of their de cision to remain within or withdrawal from the main study.  
4.4.2. Subject Data P rotection Relative to Pharmacogenomics 
Sage Therapeutics will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, their family members, their general physician, their employer or any insurance company unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. While extra precautions will be taken to preserve confidenti ality and to prevent genetic data from 
being linked to an individual’s identity outside of a restricted access site, in certain exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a medical emergency or as a consequence of a specific regulatory need), 
certain individuals may see both genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject; however in 
all cases a subject’s medical information and genetic files will remain physically separated.

drug infusion commenced within six hours of the investigator’s determination that they failed the 
QW.  
Subjects will be randomized to SAGE -547 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio with 70 subjects to be 
randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 subjects to be randomized to placebo.  Rand omization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of previous third line agent 
wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).    
The randomized portion of the study will be blinded, with the two treatments (SAG E-547 and 
placebo) being indistinguishable so that patients, relatives, nursing and medical staff, pharmacists and monitors will not be able to ascertain which subject was allocated to which treatment.  
For all subjects in the study, attempts will be made t o wean the subject off all third -line agents

Those subjects who fail the primary endpoint, and require re -institution of a third -line agent 
regimen before the end of the blinded study drug infusion or within 24 hours of completing the 
blinded study drug infusion will be eligible to receive an open -label infusion of SAGE -547 at a 
dose higher than that administered in the blinded part of the study.  The blind will be maintained 
for all subjects in the study, so subjects who failed on SAGE -547 and subjects who fai led on 
placebo will all subsequently be eligible to be administered SAGE -547 at the higher dose.

8.4.1. Withdrawal/Discontinuation of Individual  Subjects  
The reasons for study  drug discontinuation and/or  subject withdrawal from  the study  must be  
recorded in the subject’s  electronic case report form  (eCRF).   The Investigator must notify  the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately  when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn 
due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  or their LAR  may withdraw subjects  from  the study at any time for any reason  without 
compromising the subject’s medical  care.   The Investigator  will also withdraw  subjects  upon the 
request  of Sage Therapeutics  or upon termination  of the study.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Visit 10 (or 10R)  should complete the procedures  
scheduled for the day of study drug taper (hour 121-144; Visit8/8R ) on the day of their  
withdrawal, including  the SAGE -547 taper schedule, with the addition of the mortality  assessment  
from Visit 12/12R .  Subjects who withdraw from the study  after Visit 10/10R  should undergo 
study procedures as outlined for Visit 12/12R  on the day of their withdrawal.   In all cases, the  
reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in  the eCRF.  
Withdrawal  of subjects  for any reason  should be discussed with  the Medical  Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
If it is necessary  to discontinue the study  drug earlier than pla nned, subjects should continue to be 
followed per protocol  to capture safety  and efficacy  assessments for the  duration of the study  
period. 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882720] from  the study drug for the following reasons:  
• Upon subject’s  or LAR ’s request  
• The subject  or LAR  is unwilling  or unable to  adhere to  the protocol- specified  visits  
• The subject experiences an intolerable adverse event  
• During the course of the study, the subject develops symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Other medical reason, at  the discretion  of the Investigator and/or the  Medical  Monitor 
Subjects who discontinue the study  due to an AE considered related to study  drug should be  
followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the  Investigator determines the event is  
no longer  clinically  significant.  Study drug discontinuation due to AEs considered not related to 
study drug will be followed until resolution or until Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
8.4.2. Study  Termination  
Sage  Therapeutics  may terminate  this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety  
reasons including  the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to  
subjects, administrative  or operational reasons.   In the event  of study termination,  Sage 
Therapeutics  will provide written  notification  to the Investigator.  Investigational sites must 
promptly notify their IRB and initiate  withdrawal  procedures for participating  subjects.

10.3. Route of Administration  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882726] should be  administered  via a dedicated  peripheral IV line 
using any  Sage-supplied study- specific IV administration  bags and lines.   In order to preserve 
blinding, these instructions also apply to the blinded placebo infusions. 
10.4. Treatment Period  
The treatment  period with double-blind SAGE -547 or placebo is six 24 -hour periods  (144 hours), 
which may encompass  6-[ADDRESS_882727] may be given  at the discretion  of the Investigat or at any 
time during the study.  All concomitant medications  should be  documented throughout the study 
from  Screening  through  Visit 12/12R and  recorded  on the eCRF.  
SAGE -547 has demonstrated  inhibitory  effects  on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ).  
Therefore,  AEDs such as phenytoin and  phenobarbital that  are primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_097]2C9  
should be  closely  monitored during SAGE -[ADDRESS_882728] “failed 
first-line agents” and “failed second -line agents”.  
10.5.2. Concomitant T hird-Line Agents  
All third -line agents (as defined in Section  8) administered since the diagnosis of SE will be 
recorded on the eCRF , whatever path the patient too k for entry into the study .  Details will 
include the name [CONTACT_18467] , the start and stop dates and times, and the doses with start and stop 
times for each change in dose.  This recording of third -line agents will continue throughout the 
study until Visit  12/12R. 
In addition, those changes in dose that constitute a wean attempt will be marked  as such on the 
eCRF .  In this way the start and stop dates and times of all wean attempts (see Section  11 for 
definitions) will be recorded, as will the type of wean (QW, OW, or TW) and the outcome of the 
wean attempt (successful, failed and dose of this third -line agent increased or failed and this 
third -line agent stopped  and another third- line agent started ).  Those wean attempts that occur 
after the TW up to and including Visit 12/12R will be marked “A W”. 
Some third -line agents (such as propofol) are also used to induce sedation to facilitate a subject’s 
ability to toler ate the ventilator , or as analgesics to cover potentially painful procedures .  For 
subjects requiring such sedation, propofol is the preferred agent unless there are 
contraindications.  The eCRF will make clear from the indication for the third -line agent when it 
is being used for burst or seizure suppression and when it is being used as ventilator support  or 
for another purpose.  The investigator will add a note to the eCRF to justify that the doses used 
are appropriate for sedation and not for seizure or burst suppression.  The doses used for 
ventilator support and other similar uses are usually much lower than those used for seizure or 
burst suppression, and use of these third- line agents for these other purpose s does not constitute a 
wean failure under t his protocol. 
10.5.3. Concomitant Pressors  
The start and stop dates and times of all pressors will be recorded as well as the start and stop dates and times of all dose changes.

the end of the blinded ( first) infusion of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882730] 
evidence of physiologic brain activity (determined by [CONTACT_66594]) to be deemed to be successes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Weaning 
Third -line agents are anesthetic agents that are administered in order to reach a burst suppression 
EEG pattern.  For the purposes of this study, third- line agents are defined as continuous 
intravenous infusions of pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol, and ketamine  at maintenance doses 
alone or in combination sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the EEG.  The 
following are considered to be minimum maintenance doses of these agents that may be expected 
alone or in combination to achieve EEG burst suppression.  If subjects are on lower doses than 
these and are not in EEG burst suppression for the 24 hours prior to the QW, they will be 
considered to be screen failures and will exit the study after the QW.  
• Pentobarbital: 1 mg/kg/hour 
• Midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg/hour 
• Propofol: 3 mg/kg/hour 
• Ketamine 1.2 mg/kg/hour 
The timing and  nature of the third- line agent  weans will be determined by [CONTACT_655681], and will always be primarily done in the best medical interests of the subject.   However, the following guidance must be followed and if 
questions arise regarding the weaning of third- line agents, specifics should be discussed with the 
medical monitor.  Additionally, advice about weaning may be sought from fellow investigators in the study, particularly those with the most experience of performing clinical trials in subjects with 
SRSE.  
The following guidance for weaning appl ies to all weans of third -line agents undertaken during the 
study.  These weans include the qualifying wean (QW); the terminal wean (TW), which is the wean of the third -line agent if the subject is on only one third- line agent or the wean of the last 
third -line agent if the subject is on more than one third -line agent; the other weans (OW), which 
are the weans of the third -line agents other than the TW  if the subject is on more than one third-
line agent.   The guidance also applies to additional weans (AW), which are the weans from third 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882731] blinded study drug infusion or the second 
open-label study drug infusion. 
QW Guidance  
• Wean to be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If br eakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third -line agent being weaned should be re -instituted at a dose 
that was controlling seizures, or a new third- line agent should be started to replace that 
third -line agent or be administered  in addition to the third -line agent that is the subject of 
the wean attempt.  
OW Guidance  
• First OW should begin at H49 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• If the subject is on two third- line a gents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882732] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning 
attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
• If the subject is on three third -line agents, ideally the first should be weaned over [ADDRESS_882733] -line agent being weaned should be 
adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning attempt continued once the seizure activity 
abates.  
• All OWs should be completed before H96 after starting the blinded administration of study 
drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
TW Guidance  
• If the subject is on one thi rd-line agent, the TW should begin at H49 after starting 
administration of study drug or starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547.  If the 
subject has had one or more OWs, the TW should begin as soon as the last OW is complete 
but in any case not later  than H97 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or 
after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
• The TW must be completed as soon as possible, but in any case over no more than 24 
hours. 
• Breakthrough seizures must be managed as far as possible with intermittent bolus doses of 
AEDs and optimization of the repeat dose regimens.  If breakthrough seizures cannot be 
managed in this way, the third -line agent being weaned should be re -instituted at a dose 
that was controlling seizures, or a  new third- line agent should be started to replace  this 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882734] of 
the wean attempt.  
• Every effort must be made to complete the TW before H120 after starting the blinded 
administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547, but the 
TW must be complete before H144 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-547. 
AW Guidance  
• AWs will take place when medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Ideally the AW should take place over [ADDRESS_882735] -line agent being weaned should be adjusted to control seizures, with the weaning 
attempt continued once the seizure activity abates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. EEG  
Electroencephalographs (EE Gs) that are representative of the intermittent or continuous EEG 
being used to support key investigator decisions will be collected at the following time points: 
• A six -hour duration EEG will be performed  from the time of consent (CEEG).  The intent 
is to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for 
that patient; patterns would be seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst 
suppression for the second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third path to 
eligibility.  
• EEG will be performed  to cover the qualifying wean (QWEEG).  EEG will start [ADDRESS_882736] -line agent(s) or the decision to re -institute a third -line 
agent(s) at doses intended to induce burst suppression. 
• EEG will be performed from three hours prior to the start of the blinded infusion to five 
hours after the start of the blinded infusion.  The intent of this EEG is to see the effect that 
the loading dose of blinded study drug infusion has on the EEG. 
• EEG will be performed  to cover the final or terminal wean of third -line agent (TWEEG).  
The TW is the wean of the final third -line agent during the blinded administration of study 
drug or the open-label infusion of SAGE-547; if the subject was on one third- line agent, the 
TW is the wean of that agent.  If the subject was on three third- line agents, the TW is the 
wean of the third and final agent.  EEG recording will start [ADDRESS_882737] suppression because any seizure activity could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses of AEDs.

 • EEG will be performed  during the taper of the blinded administration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 (TAEEG).  The TAEEG is recorded for all subjects, 
whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpoint.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the start of the taper (at Hour 119.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours during the taper, and then continue for the one hour after the end of the taper (to Hour 145 after starting the blinded administration of study drug or after 
starting the open- label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the TAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882738] suppression because any 
seizure activity seen during the taper could not be managed using intermittent bolus doses 
of AEDs.  
• EEG will be obtained to cover the end of the taper of the blinded administration of  study 
treatment  or the open- label infusion of SAGE -547 and the ensuing 24- hour period, during 
which the primary endpoint is assessed (PAEEG).  The PAEEG is recorded for all subjects, whether they are deemed to be successes or failures on the primary endpo int.  The EEG 
recording will start 30 minutes prior to the end of taper (at Hour 143.5 after starting the 
blinded administration of study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE-
547), continue for 24 hours after the end of the blinded a dministration of study treatment or 
the open- label infusion of SAGE -547, and then continue for the one hour after the end of 
the 24- hour assessment period (to Hour 169 after starting the blinded administration of 
study treatment or after starting the open -label infusion of SAGE -547).  The duration of the 
PAEEG will be 25.[ADDRESS_882739].  In some cases 
(the TAEEG and PAEEG, for instance), the EEG records will overlap, but different cuts are taken to service the different EEG record requirements.  
The electronic EEG file will be de- identified, the date and time of the start and stop of the EEG 
and the subject number will be attached to the file, and the study time point will be indicated (CEEG, QWEEG, TWEEG, TAEEG, and PAEEG).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_655541], as follows:

11.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)  
The CGI scales are validated measures often utilized in clinical trials  to allow clinicians to 
integrate several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition.  Both the 
CGI-Severity  (CGI -S) and the  CGI-Improvement (CGI -I) employ  a 7-point Likert scale measuring  
severity  of the disease state  in the subject and improvement, respectively.  All severity  assessments 
after initiation of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882742] over the 
preceding  week.  
• The CGI will be evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_882743] visit, Visit 12 or 12R .

These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory; hour -to-hour medical decisions will be 
based on sampling for laboratory testing done outside the protocol as part of normal standard of 
care. 
Any out -of-range values will be flagged by [CONTACT_25699]; the investigator will add a comment 
about whether the abnormality is clinically significant.  Clinical significant abnormalities are those that prompt an intervention and will be recorded as a dverse events.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Test  
Females of child -bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy  by [CONTACT_655632] 1.  
In this study, since an accurate hi story of menstruation in girls and menopause in older women 
may not be available at Visit 1, “child -bearing potential” is taken to mean any female aged [ADDRESS_882749] will be ineligible 
for study  participation.

The heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be recorded, as well as any clinically 
significant abnormalities  in the rhythm.  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882752] has died, 
the following information will be collected:  
• Date of death ; 
• Cause of death.  
As accurate  as possible cause of death  will be collected,  which  will be further categorize d as due to  
one of the following causes:  
• SE; 
• complications  of long term intubation and third-line agent infusions;  
• underlying cause of qualifying SE;  
• co-morbidity existing  at the time of the qualifying SE;  
• new co -morbidity or trauma; 
• other (specify).  
11.2.7. Pharmacogenetic S ample s 
If a subject’s LAR consents to pharmacogenetic sampling, a blood sample for genetic research will 
be collected at Visit 1  in order to avoid the  possible introduction of bias through the exclusion of 
patients who may withdraw from study due to an AE (a subject population that may be of specific 
interest for subsequent genetic analysis).  If for any reason a s ample cannot be taken prior to 
treatment , a sample can be drawn at any point prior to completion with the restriction that no more 
than one genetic sample be taken per subject . 
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction and exploratory research into how genes or specific genetic variation may influence response (i.e. distributio n, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -547.  Specific genetic variations of interest 
include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (e.g. Cytochrome P450 supra -
family genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and me tabolism of 
allopregnanolone (e.g. AKR1C4 (3a -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)), genes associated with the 
GABA receptor (e.g. GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3) and genes 
associated with the production and degradation of GABA. 
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to SAGE -547 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -547 is being  evaluated.  
Thus, the genetic research my involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene categories, but 
only as related to disease susceptibility and drug action. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Biological Sampling and Coding Procedures (Pharmacogenetics) 
To ensure patient confidentiality, utmost care will be taken in the coding and storage of 
pharmacogenetic samples.  
Extra ction and coding:  DNA will be extracted from the blood sample and the DNA sample will be 
assigned a unique number replacing information from sampling tube.  The assigned DNA number 
will be used to identify the sample and its corresponding information withi n Sage Therapeutics or 
at any designated contract laboratory for the purpose of sequencing of other DNA specific

 analysis.  No personal details sufficient for individual identification will be available to any person 
(internal or external to Sage Therapeut ics) working with the DNA.  
Genotype/Phenotype Analysis : Samples and data from genetic analysis will be coded.   The link 
between subject enrollment / randomization code and DNA number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment with restricted access.  The established link will be used to identify 
relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitated correlation of genotype results with clinical data, 
allow regulatory audit, and to trace samples for destruction in case of withdrawal of consent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retention of Biological Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
Extracted DNA is a finite research that is destroyed in the process of being analyzed.  Primary 
blood samples from which DNA can be extracted will be stored and used until no further analyses 
are possible, a maximum storage period of [ADDRESS_882753] visit has been 
reached, or an individual or LAR withdrawals his/her or their consent. 
11.2.8. Other Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Data  
Formal plasma and urine analysis of SAGE -547 exposure will occur in a central bioanalytical lab 
with a validated detection method for SAGE -547 (high performance liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrome try (HPLC MS/MS)).  In addition, a ll samples will be analyzed for 
important SAGE -547 metabolites (if and when these are identified) and Captisol® concentrations. 
Plasma Analysis  
Plasma will be collected to assay for SAGE -547 concentrations at the following  time points 
relative to the start of each infusion of study drug: 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12, 
+24, +48, +72, +96, +120 (immediately prior to the end of the maintenance infusion), +128  
(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step), +136  (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +144 (immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152,  
and +160 hours after the start of the blinded SAGE-547 or placebo study drug infusion. 
• pre-dose and at +0.5, +1 (immediately prior to the end of the loading dose), + 3, +6, +12,

(immediately prior to the end of the first taper step) , +132 (immediately prior to the end of 
the second taper step) , +138 (immediately prior to the end of the third taper step ), +144 
(immediately after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_655318]), +152, and +160 hours after the start 
of the open label SAGE-547 study drug infusion. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of important metabolites of 
SAGE -547 if and when these are identified. 
• All samples will also be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Captisol®. 
The plasma samples will be drawn from an arterial -line, central line or the arm contralateral to that 
used for drug administration.  PK collection times should be adhered to as strictly as possible.  The 
allowed time window for all samples is +/ - [ADDRESS_882754] samples taken as outlined

Each blood sample will be [ADDRESS_882756] having two infusions of study 
drug will be 99 ml (49.5 ml for children weighing less than 30 kg). 
Plasma PK parameters for SAGE -547 will be calculated where appropriate (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, tmax, 
AUC last, AUC ∞, CL s).  In addition, similar PK parameters will be calculated for Captisol®.  PK 
parameters for important metabolites of SAGE -[ADDRESS_882757] 70 patients enrolled in the study , all urine voided in each 24- hour period during and 
after the blinded and open- label infusions of study drug will be collected and pooled.  The total 
volume for each 24 -hour period will be measured and a  20 ml sample will be taken from eac h 
pooled urine collection (0- 24 hours: 25- 48 hours: 49- 72 hours: 73- 96 hours: 97- 120 hours: 121-
144 hours: 145- 168 hours) and analyzed for urine concentrations of SAGE -547 (and important 
metabolites as and when these are identified) and Captisol®. 
Full det ails of all pharmacokinetic analyses will be described  in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlation of QT/QTc Changes and Plasma Concentrations of SAGE-547 
An analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any correlation between changes in 
QT/QTc interval and plasma concentrations of SAGE -547, in order to investigate any effect that 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_882758] on QT/QTc interval.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacoeconomic Data 
At Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, the following information will be collected:  number of days in the ICU, 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], discharge destination from the ICU, discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject dies before Visit 12  or Visit 12 R, data will be collected up to the date of 
death.  The definition of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” is the institution that the subject was initially treated in.  If the 
subject is transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655369] “discharge destination from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” and the “number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]” would be the number of days in the initial treating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. FOUR Score  
The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness or FOUR Score is designed to assess conscious level and 
unlike other scores, is suitable for subjects who are intubated.  It assesses four domains of 
neurological function (eye responses, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and breathing pattern).

9 March 2015                                                                         63  Confidential  
 The FOUR Score will be collected at the following time points  relative to each infusion of study 
drug (the initial blinded infusion and the second open- label infusion if this is administered) : 
• baseline, +24, +48, +72, +96, +120, +144, +168, and +192 hours (all +/ - 2 hours) after the 
start of the infusion, and at Visit 11 /11R and Visit 1 2/12R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GO S) 
The GO S is a relatively  common assessment  scale  used to standardize descriptions  of the 
objective degree of recovery  from brain injury such as cerebral trauma, or in this case SRSE .  It 
was first used in 1975 (Jennett and Bond 1975)  and allows  a prediction of the long- term course of 
rehabilitation  to return  to work  and everyday  life.  The scale classifies subjects into 5 groups: 
• Death : severe injury or death  without recovery  of consciousness 
• Persistent  vegetative state: severe damage with prolonged state of unresponsiveness and a 
lack of higher mental  functions 
• Severe disability: s evere injury with  permanent  need  for help  with  daily  living  
• Moderate  disability : no need  for assistance  in everyday life, employment is possible but 
may require special equipment   
• Low disability: light  damage with  minor neurological  and psychological deficits.  
The GOS will be assessed at Visit 12  or Visit 12 R. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supervision Rating Scale (SRS)  
The Supervision Rating  (SRS)  measures  the level  of supervision that a patient/subject receives  
from  caregivers.   The SRS rates  level  of supervision on a 13-point ordinal scale that can optionally 
be grouped into five ranked  categories  (Independent, Overnight Supervision, Part-Time  
Supervision, Full-Time  Indirect  Supervision, and Full-Time  Direct  Supervision).  The SRS was 
designed  to be rated  by a clinician  based  on interviews  with the subject  and an informant who has 
observed at first hand the level  of supervision received  by [CONTACT_423] (Boake 2000) .  Scoring is a 
one
-step procedure in which  the clinician  assigns the rating  that is closest  to the subject's  level.   
Ratings  are based  on the level  of supervision received,  not on how much  supervision a subject  is 
judged or predicted  to need. 
The SRS will be assessed at Visit [ADDRESS_882759] immediately prior to the 
admission that included the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_261407]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified  Rankin  Scale – 9Q (mRS -9Q) 
The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale to determine  disability  and 
functional dependence due to neurological  insult such as stroke  in adults .  The 7 point scale (0 – 6) 
denotes functional capacity  from  no symptoms  (0) to severe disability  (5) and death  (6).  The 
Modified Rankin Scale  – 9Q is a shortened version consisting of 9 questions that reliably  
determines  the mRS  score  and was developed  to both simplify  the assessment  and expand  the 
rater base to non- medically  trained  personnel (Patel, Rao et al. 2012 ).  The assessment  is a web-
based  tool in the public domain with automatic  score calculation  and error checking  found at

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical Plan  
Complete details for the  analysis and reporting of data from this study will be contained in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.1. Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of subjects have completed  the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655682]- estimation purposes.  Since the sponsor 
will be kept uninformed of the response rates at the time of the interim analysis, no statistical 
adjustment will be made to the level of significance for hypothesis testing at the end of the study.  
A detai led description of the interim analysis plan will be included in the DSMB charter. 
13.1.2. Study Populations  
The Safety Population  is defined as all subjects who at least had an infusion of blinded study 
medication initiated . 
The Modified Intent to Treat  Population  is defined as all subjects who : 
1. complete their initial course of blinded SAGE -547 or placebo treatment  unless the non-
completion was due a drug- related adverse event;  and 
2.  have at least one attempt to wean from third -line agents prior to the end of blinded study 
treatment  infusion unless the failure to wean was because seizures were not controlled . 
Narratives will be prepared for all subjects who do not complete the infusion of blinded study medication  or were not subjected to any wean attempts.  Narratives will include  details of  the 
cause of SE, the comorbid conditions, the adverse event(s), and reasons for non- completion of the 
infusion or failure to attempt weaning .  This blinded narrative will be reviewed by [CONTACT_655683].  Acceptable reasons for excluding 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882770] with 
variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use (yes or no) and number of previous third-
line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two or more) .  In this analysis, a tr eatment 
responder is a subject who is successfully weaned off all third -line agents and blinded study 
medication prior to the end of study treatment infusion and remains off third- line agents for at least 
[ADDRESS_882771] evidence of physiologic brain activity as determined by [CONTACT_66594].  The 
comparison of treatment response rates will be conducted at the 5% level of significance.  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed on the ITT population, in which subjects who were not included in the MITT population are assumed to be treatment failures.  In 
addition sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the MITT population 
based on: 
• the number of third- line agents (one, two, or three) subjects were administered post -
randomization; and 
• which third line agent was the subject of the first TW. 
13.1.5. Analysis of S econdary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between SAGE -547 and placebo treated subjects  in the 
MITT  population with a hierarchical testing  process at the 5% level of significance.  The analysis 
of secondary efficacy endpoints will use  the order of endpoints as listed in the Endpoints Section  
(Section  6).  Assuming there is a significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, 
the first secondary endpoint will be compared between groups.  The testing process will continue until all endpoints have been evaluated or one of the analyses yields a non- significant result.  
Summary statistics will be provided for all endpoints.   Categorical endpoints ( change from 
baseline in CGI, secondary response rates, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_655546]) will be e valuated via Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis with

 variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use and number of previous wean attempts .  
Analysis of continuous endpoints (time to re -institution of third line agents for primary and 
secondary respons e, number of days without status epi[INVESTIGATOR_655376]) will be 
performed using Analysis of Variance with variables for treatment, concomitant pentobarbital use 
and number of previous wean attempts.  If it is found there are too many tied observations in the 
continuous data, a non- parametric analysis may also be performed.  
13.1.6. Analysis of O ther Endpoints  
Safety and “Other” endpoints will only be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of safety endpoints will be based on the overall Safety Population.  
13.1.7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655437].  Kaplan -Meier curves may be plotted if sufficient data are 
available.  
Utilization of AEDs during follow -up and during recurrence will be summarized . 
13.1.8. Questionnaires  
The data collected from each questionnaire will be interpreted according to the standard 
methodology for that questionnaire.  There will be no adjustment for miss ing values.  
13.1.9. Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis 
Details of the pharmacokinetic data analysis will be described in detail in a separate 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.   
13.1.10. Pharmacogenetic Data Analysis 
Any genotype data generated in this study will stored within a s ecured database within Sage 
Therapeutics and / or a third party contracted to work with Sage Therapeutics to analyze the samples.   Because the number of subjects agreeing to participate in the genetic research component 
of the study is unknown, it is not possible to establish, a priori, whether sufficient samples will be 
obtained to support formal statistical evaluation of data.  As a consequence a Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis P lan will only be prepared where appropriate and the results obtained from any geneti c 
research will be reported in a report separate from the main study CSR.  
13.1.11. Retreated Subjects  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who fail initial treatment and are retreated w ith SAGE -547.  Separate summaries 
will be derived for subjects initially receiving SAGE -547 and those initially receiving placebo. 
13.1.12. EEG -Responders  
Summary statistics will be calculated for primary and secondary response and duration of response for those subjects who are classified as EEG -responders/non- responders based on the independent 
assessment of the PAEEG.  Summaries will be derived for the two randomized treatment groups.

 13.1.13. QT/QTc Assessment  
An analysis of the correlation between changes in QT/QTc inte rvals and SAGE -[ADDRESS_882772] on QT/QTc 
interval.  A detailed description of the QT/ QTc assessment will be included in the SAP.  
13.1.14. Quantitative EEG  
The six EEG records for each subject may be subjected to exploratory quantitative EEG analysis, 
the details of which will be included in the EEG Analysis Plan.  In summary the following 
comparisons may be made, SAGE -547 versus placebo: the QWEEG versus the TWEEG ( main 
analysis); the CEEG versus PAEEG (subsidiary analysis); and TAEEG versus PAEEG 
(exploratory analysis).  
13.2. Determination  of Sample  Size 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under 
these assumptions, with 63 subjects  randomized to SAGE -547 and 63 subjects randomized to 
placebo, there would be 90% power for detecting a significant difference between groups  at a 5% 
level of significance.  To accoun t for approximately  10% of subjects being excluded from the 
MITT , a total of 140 subjects will be randomized , 70 to SAGE -547 and 70 to placebo .  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_655670] (yes or no) and number of 
previous third- line agent wean attempts prior to randomization (one vs two  or more).  
13.3. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A separate SAP will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized  and approved prior to database lock.  All deviations from or changes to 
the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the SAP and will be summarized in  
the final clinical study  report.  
 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882773] is randomized in the study.  Section  14.1 summarizes  
Investig ator responsibilities  regarding the identification  and documentation of AEs,  the 
classification  of AEs for relationship  to study  drug and severity,  and the reporting  of AE 
information to the Sponsor and  the IRB. 
Section  14.2 summarizes  Sponsor/Medical  Monitor Responsibilities  regarding  monitoring of AE 
data and  reporting relevant safety  information to FDA.  
Section  14.3 lists important AE definitions.  
14.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
14.1.1. Identification and Documentation of  Adverse Events by [CONTACT_655618]  (if possible) to identify  AEs during  the course 
of the study.  AEs will be collected from the signature [CONTACT_655713] 12/12R .  
Adverse events that occur prior to completion of screening  will be  captured on the Medical History  
eCRF.  Adverse events that occur  after completion of screening  will be recorded on the Adverse  
Event eCRF.  
All AEs revealed by [CONTACT_4171], other diagnostic  procedures, or spontaneously  reported by [CONTACT_285927]/or in response to an open question from  study personnel will be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Form.  Any clinically  significant  deterioration in laboratory  assessments or other  
clinical findings are considered an AE and must  be recorded on the  Adverse Event Form, unless 
otherwise stated.   AE information recorded will be entered into the database on an ongoing basis.  
AEs with a relationship considered related to study  drug (probable, possible) should be  followed 
until the event is resolved or the  Investigator determines the  event  is stable or no longer  clinically  
significant.  AEs considered not related to study drug will be followed until resolution or until 
Visit 12/12R, whichever is shorter. 
For SAEs, an electronic Serious Adverse Event eCRF  must be completed with as much  
information as possible and submitted in the  time frame described below in  Section  14.1.3.  When 
new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the 
electronic SAE  eCRF should be updated within one working day.  If the subject was an  outpatient 
at the time of the SAE and was  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655378], a copy  of relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] 
(e.g., admission report, laboratory  test results, discharge summary,  etc.) may be requested to be 
included as part of the subject medical file.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or until a stable status has been  achieved.

 14.1.2. Adverse Event  Classification   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to Investigational Drug  
None:  No relationship  between  the experience  and the administration  of study  drug;  related  to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant  medications  or subject’s  clinical  state.  
Possible:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  might  have  been  produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical  state or other  modes  of therapy  
administered  to the subject,  but this is not known for sure.  
Probable:  A reaction  that follows  a plausible  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study  drug and 
follows  a known  response  pattern  to the suspected  study  drug.   
The reaction  cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_7199]’s  clinical 
state or other  modes  of therapy  administered  to the subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intensity  
Mild  For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a slight  or minor  change  in a lab result  or clinical sign or 
symptom  that does not require  immediate  corrective  action.  
Moderate  For subjects  that are unconscious,  this may be a clinically  meaningful  change  that may require  
immediate  corrective action.  
Severe  For unconscious  subjects, this may be a significant clinical change  that requires  immediate  corrective  
action.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action  Taken  with  Investigational Drug  
None  Study  medication  was continued  without  change .  
Discontinued  Study  medication  was terminated . 
Dose  adjusted  Study  medication  dose/infusion  rate was changed  and then continued  per protocol . 
Interrupted  Study  medication  was interrupted and then continued  per protocol . 
Unknown  The action  taken  with regard  to study  medication  is unknown. 
Not applicable   Administration  of study  medication  was not ongoing .

Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
9 March 2015                                                                         79  Confidential  
 14.2. Sponsor/Medical Monitor  Responsibilities  
14.2.1. Monitoring  of Adverse Event  Data  
The Medical  Monitor will review  any newly  reported  adverse events  in an ongoing basis.   If the 
aggregate assessment  indicates  that an event  is occurring  more frequently  than would normally be 
expected  in this population, or as previously observed, and the sponsor believes that the events are 
causally related to the administration of SAGE -547, the Sponsor will then report  that information  
in an IND safety  report. 
14.2.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor the clinical, PK and PD data for safety signals throughout the 
study and will be asked to assess efficacy at the time of the interim analysis to determine study 
continuation. In order to perform their monitoring function the DSMB will have access to un-
blinded data as necessary.  
The composition and procedures for the board will be  described in a separate DSMB Charter.  
14.2.3. Reporting  to FDA  
The Sponsor must report  in an IND safety  report  any suspected  adverse reaction  to study 
treatment  that is both serious and unexpected  (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)(i)).   Before  submitting  an 
IND safety  report,  the Sponsor will ensure the event  meets  all three of the definitions: (1) 
suspected  adverse reaction,  (2) serious, (3) unexpected.   If the AE does not meet  all three of the 
definitions, it should not be submitted  as an IND safety  report.   The Sponsor should evaluate the 
available information  and decide whether  there  is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused  the 
adverse  event  and, therefore,  that the event  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction.  
If there is a serious and unexpected  su spected  adverse reaction,  the Sponsor will notify  the 
appropriate regulatory agency(ies)  and all appropriate parties  on an expedited  basis.   In addition, 
Sponsors must submit expedited  reports  of an increased  rate of occurrence or severity of serious 
suspected  adverse reactions  over that  listed  in the protocol or Investigational Brochure.  
S[LOCATION_003] Rs will be unbl inded prior to reporting to FDA.  Unless it is necessary to unblind for the 
safety of the patient, the investigator will not be informed of the unblinding of the subject.  
Under [ADDRESS_882775] medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether  
or not considered  drug  related.  
Protocol 547- SSE-301 Phase 3 Study of SAGE -547 in SRSE   Sage Therapeutics  
  
9 March 2015                                                                         80  Confidential  
 14.3.2. Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Any AE for which  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the drug caused  the AE.  For the purposes 
of IND safety  reporting,  ‘‘reasonable  possibility’’  means  there is evidence to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the AE.  Suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  degree of 
certainty  about causality  than  adverse reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by a drug.  
14.3.3. Life-Threatening  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.   It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more  severe  form,  might  
have caused  death. 
14.3.4. Serious  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it  results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE – see definition  above 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disability  
• A congenital  anomaly/b irth defect  
Important medical  events  that may  not result  in death, be life -threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93054], based  upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  
in this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not 
result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug  dependency or  drug  abuse. 
14.3.5. Unexpected  
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed  in the Investigational Brochure  or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  
that has been  observed, or  
• If an Investigational Brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent with the risk 
information  described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere  in the current  
application, as  amended.  
For example,  under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_655636])  if the Investigational Brochure  referred  only to elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis.   
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_106118])  if the Investigational Brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular  accidents.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are 
mentioned in the Investigational Brochure  as occurring with  a class  of drugs or as anticipated  from  
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882776] ’s treatment  in the study  via the IVRS; this normally  require s 
prior approval by [CONTACT_7195].  However, if the subjec t is at immediate risk and the 
Investigator believes that immediate knowledge of the study treatment will alter medical 
management, discussion with the medical monitor may take place after unblinding.  The 
Investigator will not unblind the medical monitor during that discussion.  The process of 
unblinding will ensure that only the investigator is unbl inded; the medical monitor, study 
management team, and data management team will not be made aware of the treatment allocation 
of an individual subject.  All cases of emergency unblinding will be fully documented in a way 
that does not unblind the medical monitor, study management team, and data management team.  
15. STUDY ADMINISTRATI VE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
The Investigators and institutions  will permit trial related  monitoring, audits, IRB review,  and 
regulatory inspections as requested  by [CONTACT_8415],  the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee,  including 
direct  access  to source data/documents (i.e., original medical  records,  laboratory  reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655380], progress  reports,  signed  informed  consent  forms,  etc.)  in addition to  case report forms.  
Quality  assurance and quality  control systems  with written  standard  operating procedures  (SOPs)  
will be followed to ensure this trial will be conducted  and data will be generated,  documented 
(recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site’s  dedicated  study monitor will arrange to visit the Investigator at regular  intervals  during 
the study.  The monitoring visits  must be conducted according  to the applicable ICH and GCP  
guidelines to ensure protocol adherence,  quality  of data,  drug accountability, compliance with 
regulatory requirements,  and continued adequacy  of the investigational site  and its facilities.  
During these visits,  eCRFs  and ot her data related  to the study will be reviewed  and any 
discrepancies  or omissions will be identified  and resolved.  The study monitor  will be given  access  
to study- relevant  source documents (including medical  records) for purposes of source data 
verification.  
During and/or after completion  of the study,  quality assurance officers  named  by [CONTACT_655678]-site audits.   The Investigator is 
expected  to cooperate with any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including source 
data)  as requested.  
Quality  control will be applied  to each stage  of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable  
and have been  processed  correctly.  
Agreements,  made by [CONTACT_7216]/institution  and any other parties  involved 
with the clinical  trial,  will be in  writing  in a separate  agreement.

 15.2. Data  Handling  and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
15.2.1. Data  Handling  
Procedures  for data handling (including electronic  data)  used in this protocol will be documented 
in a Data Management  Plan.  
15.2.2. Case  Report  Form  Completion  
eCRFs  will be completed  for each study subject.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported  in the subject’s  eCRF.  
Source documentation supporting the e CRF  data should indicate  the subject’s  participation  in the 
study and should document the dates  and details  of demographics, study drug administrati on, 
study procedures,  AEs,  questionnaire completion, efficacy assessments  and subject  status , 
including survival. 
The Investigator will maintain  copi[INVESTIGATOR_655381] e CRFs  at the study site.  For subjects  who discontinue  
or terminate  from  the study,  the e CRFs  will be completed  as much  as possible, and the reason  for 
the discontinuation  or termination  clearly  and concisely  specified  on the appropriate e CRF.  
15.2.3. Retention  of Study  Records  
The Investigator will maintain  all study records  according  to ICH-GCP  and applicable regulatory 
requirements.   Records  will be retained  for at least [ADDRESS_882777]  number.  The Investigator will grant  monitor(s) and auditor(s) from  
the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority(ies) access  to the subject’s  original medical  
records  for verification  of data gathered  on the e CRFs  and to audit the data  collection  process.  The  
subject’s  confidentiality  will be maintained  and will not be made publicly available to the extent  
permitted  by [CONTACT_655625]. 
Subjects  will be notified  that registration  information, results,  and other  information  about this 
study will be submitted  to ClinicalTrials.gov,  a publicly available trial registry  database;  however, 
protected  health  information of individual subjects  will not be used. 
All information  regarding  the investigational product supplied by [CONTACT_655685].   The Investigator agrees  to use this 
information  to accomplish  the study and will not use it for other purposes without consent from  
the Sponsor.  It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the Sponsor with complete  data 
obtained during the study .  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards 
the development of the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, 
other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required . 
Protocol 547- SSE-[ADDRESS_882778] of the study should be prepared  as a protocol amendment by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Protocol amendments  should receive written  IRB/IEC  approval prior to implementation  at the 
investigative  site, except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the subjects  or when  
the changes  involve only logistical or administrative  aspects  of the trial (eg, change of monitor, 
telephone numbers).  In this case,  Sage  Therapeutics  will amend  and implement the protocol 
change and subsequently notify the regulatory authorities  and the Investigative sites who will 
notify the respective IRB,  as appropriate.

consent ( CEEG).  The intent is 
to demonstrate the EEG pattern that corresponds to the path to eligibility for the study for that 
patient; patterns would be 
seizure activity for the first path to eligibility, burst suppression 
for the second path to eligibility, 
and a variable pattern for the 
third path to eligibility.  This 
EEG will capture as much as 
possible of the burst suppression 
pattern that precedes the QW.    A 24 -hour duration EEG will be 
performed from the time of consent 
(CEEG).  The intent is to demonstra te the EEG pattern that 
corresponds to the path to 
eligibility for the study for that 
patient; patterns would be seizure 
activity for the first path to 
eligibility, burst suppression for the 
second path to eligibility, and a variable pattern for the third 
path to 
eligibility.  This EEG also aims to 
capture the burst suppression pattern during the [ADDRESS_882872] suppression required prior to initiating the qualifying wean.

Note : ‘seizure suppression’ revised 
throughout document with regards to EEG suppression goals for managing RSE and SRSE patients, as well as permitting ‘seizure suppression’ during screening period, prior to initiation of qualifying wean (QW). 
 Allowing burst or 
seizure suppression during screening period, prior to initiation of QW, allows sites to use a less restrictive approach achieving EEG suppression and one more typi[INVESTIGATOR_655579]’ standard of care when 
screening patients.

 Summary of Changes to 
Protocol 547-SSE-301, Amendment # 5 
Date of Amendment:  03 May 2017 
 
The following substantive changes are made in Protocol 547- SSE-301, Amendment #5.  In general, these  include a change in 
assumptions for the sample size estimate yielding a lower overall target enrollment and a change reflecting that the Sponsor may elect 
not to conduct the Interim Analysis. In addition, minor editorial revisions (eg, formatting , punctuation, spelling ), not listed below may 
have been  made throughout the protocol.

Interim Analysis  When approximately 50% of the subjects have 
completed the study, an interim analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_655594] -estimation purposes.   When approximately 50% of the subjects have completed the study, an interim analysis will may

Synopsis,

Analysis, Sample 
Size and Section 13.2 Determination 
of Sample Size  The sample size of this study is based on the 
assumption of a 65% response r ate to SAGE -
547 treatment and a 35% response rate to placebo treatment and a 1:1 randomization schedule.  Under these assumptions, with 70 
subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 
subjects randomized to placebo, there would be 
>90% power for detecting a sign ificant 
difference between groups at a 5% level of significance.   The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a  65% response rate to SAGE -547 
treatment and a 35%  25%  response rate to placebo 
treatment , a 30% treatment difference between 
SAGE-547 and placebo,  and a 1:1 randomization 
schedule.  Under these assumptions, with 70 63 
subjects randomized to SAGE -547 and 70 63 
subjects randomized to placebo, there would be 
>90% power for detecting a significant difference 
between groups with a [ADDRESS_883000] at 
a 5% level of significance.   It has been noted that  > 50% 
of subjects successfully wean 
off third -line anesthetics 
during the qualifying wean 
prior to randomization .  This 
high wean rate is likely to 
result  in a very low  placebo 
response rate in the 
randomized portion of the 
study .  Thus, the assumed 
placebo response rate has 
been modified from 35% to 
25%, with no change in the assumed difference between 
the rates of response to 
SAGE -547 and placebo,

parturients’ satisfaction with particular aspects  of the delivery process.  
1.2. The investigators hypothesize that parturients with access to the website will 
exhibit greater satisfaction.

and delivery regardless of analgesi c approach, implicating that multiple factors 
other than pain relief alone are involved in the childbirth experience. (1-3) 
2.[ADDRESS_992614] practice, anesthesiology is knowledgeable about  
patients who are likely to progress to active labor and delivery. These patients 
will be considered eligible and offered enrollment into the study.  
3.2. All English - or Spanish -speaking pregnant patients who are admitted to UNMH 
Labor and Delivery for planned progression to active labor will be eligible for 
inclusion. All pregnant patients will be eligible, no matter what gestational age, 
how many previous deliveries, or planned induction.   Exclusions include age 
under 18 years, those unable to provide consent for medical procedures, and 
women who do not speak ei ther English or Spanish.  
3.3. Special populations:  
 Adults unable to consent: Excluded  
 Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers): Excluded  
 Pregnant women: Included  
 Prisoners: Excluded  
3.4. No particular racial or ethnic group will be excluded .  
 
4.0 Study -Wide Number  of Subjects  
4.1. This is not a multicenter study.  
4.2. The investigators plan to recruit up to 150 patients .  The  target sample size 
after attrition is  approximately 100 completed surveys , but if actual attrition is 
less than anticipated, d ata may be obtained on up to 150 participants .

 Page 3 of 10 Template : 7/1/2015  4.3. The target  sample size should be sufficient  at α=0.05 and 80% power to 
detect a difference between group means equal to approximately 58% of the 
standard deviation.  
5.0 Study -Wide  Recruitment Methods  
This is not a multicenter study . 
6.0 Multi -Site Research  
6.1 NA; this is not multi -site research.  
7.0 Study Timelines  
7.1 The duration for an individual’s active participation in the research 
will be from the time they sign the consent form until after they have 
delivered  their baby [CONTACT_726982]. 
Depending on speed of labor progression and the delivery, this could 
be hours or days.  The investigators anticipate that enrollment will 
take approximately six months, with another six months for data 
analysis.  
8.[ADDRESS_992615] not identified any safety or exploratory 
endpoints . 
9.0 Procedures Involved * 
9.1 This is a prospective randomized study of an educational website . 
9.2 Potential participants will be offered participation  in the study. If 
they choose to participate, they will be enrolled following the 
consent process . They will be randomized into either control group 
or intervention group. Control group participants will receive  usual  
care and routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_726978] -relief information . Intervention group 
participants will receive  usual  care, plus one hour in which  to view 
the patient education website thepainlesspush.com , on an  iPad 
provided by [CONTACT_941] A nesthesiology department  for this purpose . After 
their delivery  and transfer to the mother/baby [CONTACT_273080] , participants will 
complete a satisfaction survey  brought to them by a study team 
member .  Participants will complete the survey following their 
delivery and prior to discharge.   Their active participation in the 
study will be complete at this time .

11.2 The target sample size should yield sufficient power at α=0.05 and 
80% power to detect a difference between group means equal to 
approximately 58% of the standard deviation . 
11.[ADDRESS_992618] information.  
Investigators may notify one another of recent enrollments by [CONTACT_82044] *s ecure* function in UNM Health Sciences Center email  or the 
TigerConnect communication system , both of which are HIPAA -
compliant and appropriate for internal exchange of PHI  according to 
the UNM Health System IT Security group and the HSC Chief 
Information Officer .  Remaining study records will be maintained 
for at least 3 years after study closure.  
11.4 A separate linking document will be used to link identifiers (medical 
record number) to study ID numbers.  This document will be kept 
separately from study data, in a locked cabinet in an Anesthesiology 
Department  office  belonging to a study team member.  Only study 
team members will have access to the linking document .  It will be  
securely maintained until data collection is complete (up to 
approximately one year), at which point it will be securely shredded.  
The destruction of that linking document will deidentify the study 
data.  
12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safet y of Subjects  
This study consists of exposure to an educational website, a satisfaction 
survey, and correlation of survey responses to arm assignment and basic 
demographic/medical information.  The primary risk is confidentiality 
breach  (see section 14 bel ow).  Identifiers will only be kept temporarily, 
and this study does not involve data typi[INVESTIGATOR_726979] “sensitive .”  The 
investigators thus believe that this study poses no more than minimal risk . 
Satisfaction of pain relief during labor and delivery following access to new educational 
materials . 
 Page 5 of 10 Template : 7/1/[ADDRESS_992619] -delivery satisfaction survey data .  Similarly, 
identifiers will only be kept  temporarily in order to accurately link 
arm assignment, demographic/health data, and satisfaction survey 
responses.  
14.2 The investigators do not believe that the study procedures may 
reasonably be said to carry substantial unforeseeable risks: the study 
consi sts of access to an educational website (or routine information) 
and a satisfaction survey . 
14.[ADDRESS_992620] not identified any risk s to others arising from 
subjects’ participation in this study.  
15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
15.1 The main potential benefit that participants may experience would be 
an increased knowledge base and understanding of pain relief 
options during labor and delive ry. This may help them feel more 
prepared for delivery and more comfortable with their various pain 
relief options. This knowledge may also be useful for any future 
pregnancies or deliveries . 
16.0 Vulnerable Populations  
16.1 The study targets pregnant women, but no other vulnerable group  
(prisoners, students, economically disadvantaged, etc) .  Pregnant 
women are regularly seen for labor and delivery at UNM Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
[CONTACT_157186] regularly treats laboring women as part of her routine 
clinical duties.  This study does no t modify any clinical decisions.  
Satisfaction of pain relief during labor and delivery following access to new educational 
materials . 
 Page 6 of 10 Template : 7/1/2015  As noted elsewhere, the only intervention is the selection of pain -
relief educational materials: the existing materials in routine use, or 
the newly -developed website.  The study thus presents minimal risk.  
17.[ADDRESS_992621] does not involve community -based participatory 
research.  
18.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
18.1 The investigators do not plan to share overall study results with 
participants.  Others’ satisfaction is not clearly relevant to 
participants’ birth experience . 
19.0 Setting  
19.1 Research sites/locations:  
 Potential participants will be recruited from the UNMH Labor 
& Delivery floor.  All patients admitted to that unit who are 
expected  to progress to active labor during that admission will 
be eligible for enrollment . 
 All research procedures will occur at UNMH.  Recruitment and 
patient education (routine or with the website being evaluated) 
will occur in the Labor & Delivery areas.  The post-delivery 
satisfaction survey will occur in the Mother/Baby [CONTACT_563546].  
Collection of relevant data from the electronic medical record 
will occur at UNM HSC via workstations with regular access 
to the medical record . 
20.[ADDRESS_992622]. Kathleen Reyes  is a faculty member in the UNM Department of 
Anesthesiology & Critical Care Medicine, with all relevant licensures and 
credentials.  Investigator Lauren Faber is a third -year medical student at the 
University of New Mexico School of M edicine. She has previous human -subjects 
experience at UNM SOM and Southwest Women’s Health.  
20.2. All medical decisions  will be made by [CONTACT_726983], with input from participants as appropriate.  The 
existence of this study does not modify any clinical decision.  
20.3. The necessary resources are available, as noted below:  
 UNMH serves thousan ds of parturients per year.  Only a small percentage of 
them would need to complete this study for it to achieve its target sample size 
in less than one year.    
 [CONTACT_157186]  has regular nonclinical time that is intended for activities such as 
the planned proj ect.  Likewise, the two medical -student investigators are 
expected to participate in research as part of their curriculum.  Adequate time 
is available.  
Satisfaction of pain relief during labor and delivery following access to new educational 
materials . 
 Page 7 of 10 Template : 7/1/2015   UNMH has adequate facilities to care for laboring women, and resources are 
available within the Anesthes iology department to ensure completion of the 
research, including IRB liaison, study design and statistical support, and 
manuscript preparation.  
 The research consists of an educational opportunity and satisfaction survey.  
As a result, the investigators do  not anticipate any need for medical or 
psychological resources resulting from consequences of participation.  
 The study team is relatively small, and the research is to be conducted in one 
center.  The HRRC -approved version of the protocol will be shared a mong the 
investigators prior to study commencement, and study procedures will be 
reviewed.  
21.0 Recruitment Methods  
21.1 Patients will be recruited following admission to the UNMH Labor 
& Delivery floor for expected delivery . 
21.2 UNMH serves a large catchment area, and expectant mothers present 
daily for labor and delivery . 
21.3 Physicians on the Obstetrics service routinely notify Anesthesiology 
of parturients expected to progress to active labor, in order  for them 
to provide possible consult ation  and appropriate pain relief care.  
The study team will identify potential participants fro m among this 
patient population .  Anesthesiology providers regularly review the 
medical records of this patient population upon receiving this 
notification, for purp oses of clinical treatment.  The investigators are 
requesting a partial waiver of HIPAA authorization requirements in 
order to permit the use of a subset of these records for purposes of 
verifying eligibility ( i.e. that potential participants do not meet t he 
few exclusion criteria).  The research -related protected health 
information will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or 
entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the 
research study, or for other research for which the use  or disclosure 
of protected health information for which an opportunity to agree or 
object is not required by 45 CFR 164.512.  
21.4 Recruitment will occur in person, and will not involve audio or video 
materials.  
21.5 A recruitment flyer will be posted in patient are as of the Labor & 
Delivery floor, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_726980].  
21.6 Participants will not be paid.  
22.0 Number of Subjects  
22.1. This is not a multicenter study.  
Satisfaction of pain relief during labor and delivery following access to new educational 
materials . 
 Page 8 of 10 Template : 7/1/[ADDRESS_992623] in this situation, so recruitment will not 
involve any extraneous or unexpected personnel . 
23.2 Investigators are already experienced  at interacting with patients 
during a time that is stressful in general (i.e. labor) and at specific 
moments during that time (i.e. between contractions).  Recruitment 
and consent efforts will not interfere with these interactions, or be 
“forced” during c ontractions . 
23.[ADDRESS_992624] -delivery satisfaction survey will occur in the Mother/Baby 
[CONTACT_726984], in order to provide some opportunity to  
recover from the stress of delivery.  
24.[ADDRESS_992625] s 
25.1 Participant costs will not be affected by [CONTACT_726985] . 
26.0 Consent Process  
26.1 Consent will  be obtained prior to enrollment.   The investigators are 
requesting waiver of documentation of consent  and HIPAA 
authorization , and use of an oral process  for both consent and 
HIPAA authorization .  As noted above, the research presents no 
more than minimal  risk of harm to subjects.  Similarly, it is routine 
to provide  information on analgesia options  and consultation to 
laboring women  at UNMH.  The educational website being 
evaluated is merely a specific option within the available educational 
materials.  Healthcare s atisfaction surveys (such as the Press Ganey 
healthcare satisfaction survey) are regularly conducted without 
formal written consent.  For those reasons, the investigators believe 
that this project involves no procedures for which written consen t is 
normally required outside the research context.  The demographic 
and health information to be used in this study will be obtained from 
the electronic medical record  by [CONTACT_4144] , and identifiers 
will be kept only temporarily.  A script for an oral consent and 
Satisfaction of pain relief during labor and delivery following access to new educational 
materials . 
 Page 9 of 10 Template : 7/1/[ADDRESS_992626] -participation informational handout .  The oral 
consent/HIPAA script includes the usual elements of consent, as 
well as listing the PHI to be used for the s tudy, referencing HIPAA 
and the requirement that patients give permission for use of PHI, and 
specifically asking for permission to “let us use your protected 
information.”  
 The c onsent process will occur in regular patient rooms on the 
UNMH Labor/Delivery floor, which are already sufficiently 
private for appropriately confidential doctor/patient 
conversations.  
 The investigators believe that avoiding the requirement for 
prospective participants  to read , comprehend,  and sign a 
complicated consent /HIPAA  docume nt while in labor will 
better respect their privacy considerations.  An oral process 
will be considerably less intrusive, while respecting patient 
autonomy and addressing all other required elements of 
consent  and HIPAA authorization . 
 Patients will be free  to read the educational materials, or not, as 
they see fit; similarly, they can choose to decline to answer any 
or all of the satisfaction -survey questions.  The investigators do 
not anticipate that ongoing consent will become an issue . 
Non-English Speaki ng Subjects  
 Most prospective participants speak English.  The majority of 
the remainder speak Spanish . 
 PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Reyes  speaks some Spanish, and the educational website 
is available in Spanish.  The consent process for these patients 
will occur in Spanish.   Official UNM Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_726981].  
 HRRC -approved Spanish -language documents will be used for 
patients who prefer to use Spanish .

undergoing total pancreatectomy islet autotransplantation   
Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_283256], MD  
Participating Site  University of Minnesota  
Accrual Objective  Up to 60 patients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing total pancreatectomy and islet 
autotransplant (IAT)  will be enrolled for screening.  Up to 48 participants will be randomized to 
treatment, with accrual goal of 45 completing 90 days of follow up.  
Study Design  Single center randomized, open -la bel   
Study Duration  8 years ( 2.5-3 years recruitment + 5 years follow up)  
Study Objectives  SPECIFIC AIM #1:  To determine if anti -inflammatory treatment with etanercept or 
alpha -1 antitrypsin during the critical peri-transplant engraftment period improves islet 
engraftment and function after islet autotransplant , as assessed by [CONTACT_283326]

patient’s ability to successfully and safely complete the trial.  
Treatment Description  Forty -five patients undergoing TP -IAT (day 0) at a single center will be randomized 1:1:1 to 
receive during the peri -operative period either: 1) etanercept  (50 mg on day 0  SQ; 25 mg SQ on 
days 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21),  2) alpha -1 antitrypsin  (90 mg/kg IV infusion on days -1, and +3, 7, 
14, 21, and [ADDRESS_345757] -transplant) or 3) standard care .   
Study Procedures  Pa tients will be seen within 4 weeks prior to surgery ( screening/ baseline), and at day 90  (± 14 
days ), day 365 (± 28 days ), and day 730  (± 56 days)  post-transplant.  These will occur over two 
days.  The following metabolic testing will be performed at each visit:  
1)  [ADDRESS_345758]  
2) Glucose potentiated arginine induced insulin secretion (GPAIS), performed on same 
morning as the IVGTT  
3) Mixed meal tolerance test ([ADDRESS_345759] HP)  
In addition, patients will have serum draws for mechanistic assessments and safety labs in the 
first month post -transplant as detailed in the protocol.  The mechanistic assessments will 
include unmethylated insulin DNA and cytokine/chemokine profiles.   Fo r long -term follow up 
of participants, patients will receive routine care subsequent to the day [ADDRESS_345760]  
Chronic pancreatitis is associated with incapacitating pain, frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283259] . If endoscopic procedures do not provide sufficient pain relief, total pancreatectomy (TP) may be 
considered.  This results in certain diabetes unless the islets are returned with autologous islet transplantation 
(IAT). In this procedure, the patient’s pancreas is completely removed , and the islets are isolated and infused into 
the portal vein. The islets engraft and potentially survive long term in the liver, releasing insulin in response to glucose. While 90% of patients have some function of the transplanted islet graft, only about 1/[ADDRESS_345761] -
transplant period ; we propose to directly target this destructive process .   
Two promising anti -inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283260]:  (1) the TNF α inhibitor 
etanercept and (2) alpha -[ADDRESS_345762]- transplant significantly improved insulin independence rates up to 5 year s after transplantation,  postulated 
due to  better survival of the transplanted beta cell mass in the engraftment period .  Alpha -1 antitrypsin (A1AT) 
is a serine protease inhibitor. A1AT reduces inflammatory cytokines and islet cellular infiltrates , protect s against 
cytokine- induced beta cell apoptosis, and prolongs islet graft survival in mice and non- human primates, notably 
including  in syngeneic transplant  in mice and marginal mass intraportal islet autotransplantation in monkeys, 
settings that closely replicate the TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283261] .   
This 3-arm drug -treatment clinical trial  will investigate the use of Etanercept and A1AT to improve IAT 
function at [ADDRESS_345763] -transplant beta cell apoptosis  and improve 
islet engraftment, and that this will be reflected in higher stimulated insulin and C- peptide secretion at day 90.    
Forty-five patients undergoing TP IAT at a single center will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either: 1) etanercept 
(50 mg on day 0; 25 mg on days 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21), 2) alpha-1 antitrypsin (90 mg/kg IV days -1, +3, 7, 14, 21, 
28) or 3) standard care in the peri- operative period.  Patients will have mechanistic assessments drawn in the early 
post- operative period including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  and measures of beta cell loss 
(circulating unmethylated insulin DNA, released by [CONTACT_283329] s).  Patients will return for sophisticated 
metabolic testing at 90 days, and (to gather preliminary long- term efficacy data) [ADDRESS_345764] -TPI[CONTACT_50182], patients will undergo mixed meal 
tolerance testing, IV glucose tolerance testing, and glucose -potentiated arginine -induced insulin secretion 
(GPAIS).  The latter measur es the maximally stimulated acute insulin response, or AIRmax, which is the best 
estimate of islet mass and the primary endpoint  (at day 90)  for this study.  Results will be used to select the most 
promising agent for further study in a randomized, blinded multi- center clinical trial.

 BACKGROUND 
Chronic pancreatitis affects as many as 1  in every 2,500 persons and is associated with incapacitating pain, 
frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283262] ( 1).  The health and economic costs of pancreatitis are 
great.  Nearly $300 million dollars are  spent on emergency department visits alone in the US each year  (2).  More 
than 90% of patients with chronic pancreatitis have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], half use narcotic analgesics regularly, and  
one-fourth are on disability ( 3).  The lifetime risk of diabetes mellitus is as h igh as 70% (4, 5).  Chronic 
pancreatitis is a significant health burden with few treatment options.   
While endoscopic procedures are often  employed as a first -line therapy, if ERCP  procedures do not provide 
sufficient pain relief,  surgical therapy including total pancreatectomy  (TP)  may be considered  to relieve the root 
cause of pain .  TP results in certain diabetes unless the islets are returned with  autologous islet transplantation 
(IAT) . In this procedure, the patient’s pancreas is completely removed, mechanically and enzymatically digested 
with collagenase, and the islets are isolated and infused into the portal vein. The islets engraft and potentially 
survive long term in the liver, releasing insulin in response to glucose (6).   IAT results in complete insulin 
independence in 1/3rd of patients. Another 1/3rd require only small doses of insulin, while the remaining patients 
are completely insulin dependent (4).   
The field of TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283263], with improved acceptance of this procedure in the medical GI community.  This 
is reflected in growth of the number of centers performing the procedure and the number of procedures performed 
within the past decade.  With no medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283264], TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283265], particularly those with debilitating small duct chronic pancreatitis. However, t he high prevalence of postsurgical diabetes is a major barrier for many patients and 
providers in considering TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283266].  By [CONTACT_283330][CONTACT_50182], we have the opportunity to substantially  increase the applicability o f TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283267] a treatment option 
for patients with severe chronic pancreatitis.  
Following islet transplantation, the islets must acutely survive the stress of the procedure, and  then they must 
engraft in the liver and establish a vascular 
supply. The greater the functional islet mass engrafted, the lower the risk of post-
operative diabetes (6-10).  Preventing early 
post- operative hyperglycemia reduces but 
does not prevent beta cell apoptosis.  Even 
under conditions of adequate glycemic control, beta cell apoptosis is common 
during the first month post -transplant ( 11, 
12) and is upregulated in the presence of 
inflammatory cytokines such as TNF -α. It 
has been estimated that more than half of the islet mass may be lost in the early post -
transplant period (13
).  Thus, a major 
contributor to islet loss  is the 
inflammatory damage sustained by [CONTACT_283331] -
transplant period ; this in turn adversely 
impact long -term diabetes outcomes.  We 
propose to directly target this destructive process .   
Dramatic increases in beta cell apoptosis relative to that present in the native pancreas are observed in vitro  in 
human islets and in vivo  in animal models after islet isolation, increasing over the first [ADDRESS_345765] -transplant 
(12, 14), and worsened in the presence of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF α (15).  In vitro  exposure of islets 
to TNF α alone or with IL- 1 induces beta cell apoptosis  (15).  Expression of damaging  inflammatory cytokines 
has been documented both in islet graft ( 16), and in  total pancreatectomy islet autotransplant  (TPI[CONTACT_50182]) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 

[ADDRESS_345766] glycemic control  (17, 18), presumably due to the stress of surgery . While 
inflammation may occur in the native pancreas due to recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis  prior to TPI[CONTACT_50182], 
the isolated and intrahepatically transplanted islets are uniquely and acutely  vulnerable  to this inflammatory 
stress, because the islets are devascularized, hypoxic, and directly exposed to the intraportal blood after TPI[CONTACT_50182].  
By [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_283268], we have the opportunity to increase the success of total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant for patients with chronic pancreatitis.  
These observations present an opportunity to intervene; blockade of the innate inflammatory response – 
which is directly damaging to beta cells — holds the potential to substantially improve the engrafted islet 
mass  and thereby [CONTACT_283332][CONTACT_50182] . Two promising anti -inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283269] α 
inhibitor etanercept and alpha -[ADDRESS_345767] promising anti -inflammatory drug in TPI[CONTACT_50182], which will inform future clinical trials.   To 
accomplish this goal, we will randomize 45 TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283270]: 1) standard care, 2)  etanercept,  or 
3) alpha -[ADDRESS_345768] -transplant, with pi[INVESTIGATOR_283271]- term (1  and 2  year)  diabetes outcomes .   
The proposed agents have shown promise in preclinical trials. In addition, etanercept  has shown clinical efficacy  
in allotransplantation and the survival of marginal mass autologous islet transplants in non- human primates —a 
situation nearly analogous to TPI[CONTACT_50182] —are dramatically improved under simultaneous short -term administration 
of A1AT.  However , no controlled clinical trials to date have been conducted in TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283272]. We 
have a novel opportunity to test these agents formally in clinical trials in TPI[CONTACT_50182] , using the large volume of patients 
with pancreatitis seen for this procedure at our institution.      
 
While the primary indication for total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant is to relieve pain and improve 
health -related quality of life (HRQOL), preventing or minimizing diabetes is an important secondary outcome 
which benefits recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’  long-term health and HRQOL  
Because TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283273] a major surgical procedure, with risk of diabetes, patients with chronic pancreatitis are carefully considered for this procedure by a multi -disciplinary team, and selected based on clear diagnosis of pancreatic 
disease causing pain, narco tic dependence or severely impaired quality of life, and failure to respond to maximal 
medical/ endoscopic therapy (19).  Patients at our institution since [ADDRESS_345769] been enrolled in a prospective cohort 
study to follow pain symptoms, narcotic use, and HRQOL, in addition to diabetes outcomes, after this procedure.  At 1, 2, and 3 years after TPI[CONTACT_50182], 84-86% of patients report pain as resolved or significantly improved compared to before pancreatectomy.  Mean summary scores for HRQOL obtained from the SF -36-—a standardized HRQOL 
questionnaire— are [ADDRESS_345770] deviation below the population mean for mental functioning before surgery, reflecting the severity of disease in 
this population, but improve by > [ADDRESS_345771] deviation at 1 year and 2 year s after TPI[CONTACT_50182] ( 7
). 
 
Insulin independence is observed in approximately 30% of patients at any given time between 1- [ADDRESS_345772] -
transplant (figure, below). Thus, there is significant room for improvement in diabetes outcomes after the IAT 
procedure.  About 90% of patients have functioning islets, but this function is insufficient to achieve total insulin 
independence in many cases.  Twenty percent of patients are unable to maintain  their hemoglobin A1c level <7% 
8 
 (7), the glycemic goal recommended by [CONTACT_283333] ( 20).   
 
While insulin dependent  patients do exhibit  improvement in overall HRQOL and self -report diabetes as a more 
manageable chronic disease than pancreatitis, there are important differences in HRQOL scores in the diabetic patients.  On HRQOL subscales derived 
from the SF -36, insulin independent patients had 
higher scores for physical functioning, physical role, and vitality at [ADDRESS_345773] hurdle to a successful islet transplant is the number of islets available, and thus the transplanted islet 
mass is an important predictor of subsequent diabetes risk (7-9, 21). However significant variability in diabetes 
outcomes is seen for any given transplanted islet mass.  Approximately 70% of IAT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] >5000 islet 
equivalents (IEQ)/ kilogram body weight transplanted will achieve insulin independence, while 30% ne ver come 
off insulin despi[INVESTIGATOR_283274].  In contrast,  nearly 10% of those patients with a very low islet mass (<2500 IEQ/kg) will maintain insulin independence, sometimes for years ( 7
).  This variability can 
largely be explained by [CONTACT_283334].  Beta cell 
apoptosis and loss occurs in the immediate post- operative period due to the stress of the procedure and transplant 
environment. High levels of beta cell apoptosis are observed, particularly in the 7 days after surgery , with 
apoptosis observed even at 30 days (11, 12). It has been estimated that more than half of the islet mass may be 
lost in this early post -transplant period in islet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (13). The innate  inflammatory response , 
triggered by [CONTACT_283335], hypoxia, and  hyperglycemic stress , is an important contributor to beta cell loss.  In 
alloislet transplant,  successful engraftment of transplanted islets , as demonstrated by [CONTACT_283336] 3 
months, is strongly predictive of diabetes remission at 1 year, even more so than the initial number of islets 
transplanted  (22).  Thus, this is a critical ear ly window in which to intervene to optimize engrafted islet mass.  
 Islets are damaged by [CONTACT_15457], which are expressed in the islet graft and upregulated in the 
TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283275], induced by [CONTACT_283337].  Montolio et 
al demonstrated that TNF α and IL -1 were both highly upregulated in islet tissue immediately after isolation and 
following a one day culture period, and increased after transplantation into streptozotocin- induced diabetic Lewis 
rats (day 1, 3, and [ADDRESS_345774]-transplant) even when conditions of normoglycemia were maintained ( 17).  When islets 
are infused into the intraportal environment, islet expression of tissue factor triggers an instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR), in which the complement and coagulation cascades  are activated . That, in turn, 
exacerbate s the non- specific inflammatory response, leading to neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the 
graft, increased local cytokine expression, and ultimately  islet loss  (23-26) .  Cytokines, particularly TNF α and 
IL1β, are directly damaging to islets in vitro and are proposed to mediate similar damage in vivo  post-
transplantation ( 15, 16, 27, 28).  Islet isolation itself induces high rates of beta cell apoptosis, due to the stress of Islet Graft Function by  [CONTACT_283338][CONTACT_50182]
[ADDRESS_345775] -isolation to 
TNFα (15).  Thus, the immediate post-operative period is an opportunity for meaningful intervention. 
 
Further contributing to a pro- inflammatory milieu is the major surgical procedure of total pancreatectomy and 
islet autotransplantation in patients with underlying history of chronic and/or recurrent acute pancreatitis.  Multiple pro -inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine pathways are upregulated in the one week period following 
surgery in clinical TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283276] (18).  Itoh et al demonstrated that the “danger signal” high- mobility group 
box-1 (HMGB -1) was upregulated in islet grafts from clinical TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283277] -[ADDRESS_345776] -transplant inflammation which in turn was negatively associated with 
islet graft outcomes, as measured by [CONTACT_283339] (18).  Pro-inflammatory cytokines are notably much 
following  TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283278], 
demonstrating that in fact this inflammatory re sponse is elicited by [CONTACT_283340] a consequence of the major surgery ( 26). 
   
 
Promisingly, therapeutic agents that target damaging inflammation are clinically available  
We have the opportunity to intervene by [CONTACT_283341].  Based on preclinical studies and/or experience in islet allotransplantation, two therapeutic agents are particularly promising —Alpha-1- antitrypsin (A1AT) and etanercept.  Both agents  are FDA -approved for 
indications other than IAT  and have been used extensively in humans.  A1AT is approved for use in adults with 
A1AT deficiency, and is currently under study as a beta- cell protective agent in type 1 diabetes; this agent has 
substantial preclinical data that suggest a preservation of islet mass and higher likelihood of diabetes cure when administered in the early post -operative period.  Etanercept is FDA approved for use in both children and adults 
with particular forms of inflammatory a rthritis or psoriasis.  Etanercept has been studied in non-controlled clinical 
trials in islet allotransplantation and appears within this setting to convey substantial benefit in long- term 
engraftment and survival of islet mass, even when administered for  a short duration ([ADDRESS_345777] -transplant).  
We have the opportunity to study both agents in a head- to-head comparison, and against a standard care control 
arm, to determine utility of each agent in protecting early islet engraftment and to select  which agent is most 
promising for further study and development for clinical use in TPI[CONTACT_50182]. 
 
Alpha -[ADDRESS_345778] additional 
protective effects on transplanted islets  
Alpha-1- antitrypsin (A1AT), also known as 
alpha 1-protease inhibitor, is a serine protease 
inhibitor.  A1AT inhibits the enzymatic activity 
of neutrophil elastase, thrombin, cathepsin G, 
proteinase 3, trypsin, and chymotrypsin.  A 
sterile, stable, lyophilized preparation is manufactured for clinical use by [CONTACT_283342], and is marketed by [CONTACT_283343], 
including Aralast NP (Baxter, CA).  The product 
is indicated for use in a dults with lung disease 
due to alpha -1-antitrypsin deficiency but has 
been studied for other indications, including pain management in fibromyalgia and beta cell preservation in new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus ( 29-31) .  While preclinical data is promising, there are currently no clinical trials 
underway studying this agent in patients with pancreatitis undergoing TPI[CONTACT_50182].  

[ADDRESS_345779] -transplant  (32-35).  It has been demonstrated to reverse diabetes in NOD 
mice (36, 37), protect against streptozotocin-  mediated beta cell toxicity (33), protect against cytokine -induced 
beta cell apoptosis (38, 39) , prolong islet allograft survival in mice ( 33, 34, 36, 40), and preserve islet architecture 
when islets are co -cultured with acinar proteases (41).  Importantly, A1AT has been shown to downregulate 
transcription of multiple inflammatory pathways that are activated in diabetes and islet transplant (42-44).  TNF α 
is an important central mediator in the inflammatory pathways targeted by A1AT, but many other innate 
inflammatory cytokines (IL -6, IL -8) and chemokines are affected by A1AT; thus, A1AT may be advantageous 
compared to  other immune agents in its ability to target the greater inflammatory milieu, rather than a single 
cytokine pathway.  Treatment with A1AT in clinical islet autotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283279]-transplant beta cell mass by [CONTACT_283344]. In addition, A1AT has been 
proposed to directly protect beta cells from apoptosis, and to protect transplanted islets against potentially 
damaging effects from co -transplanted exocrine tissue.  
 Alpha -[ADDRESS_345780] both development of STZ -induced diabetes in mice and spontaneous 
development of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice (33, 36, 39).  Lower levels of A1AT have been observed in 
children with type 1 diabetes ( 45) and adults with type 2 diabetes ( 46).   These findings suggest a general 
protective effect against islet damage in diabetes.  Furthermore, A1AT may have a direct inhibitory effect on beta 
cell apoptosis,  which is  increased 10 -fold after islet isolation  and transplantation (12, 47), and exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_283345]  (12, 13). In a mouse insulinoma cell line exposed to TNF α in vitro, 
treatment with A1AT greatly reduced apoptosis and entirely abolished caspase 3 expression (39).  In another 
study, beta cell apoptosis was reduced in A1AT -treated versus untreated cultured islets exposed to either TNFα 
or a three cytokine cocktail with TNF α /IL-1β/ INF -γ (38).   Koulmanda et al demonstrated a 14 -fold reduction 
in cleaved caspase 3 expression  (a pro -apoptotic marker)  at day [ADDRESS_345781] -transplant in mice treated with A1AT 
receiving syngeneic islet grafts ( 43).  
 
Alpha -[ADDRESS_345782].  
One of the less considered areas that could potentially influence human islet transplantation outcomes and 
functional capacity is the release of activated proteolytic enzymes (e.g., trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase) by [CONTACT_283346], culture, and post -transplantation.   Invariably, some exocrine tissue 
is co -cultured in the case of allografts or cotransplanted in the case of auto - and allografts .  Autologous islet 
preparations in particular often contain as much exocrine as endocrine tissue , because aggressive purification of 
islets must be avoided to maximize the islet mass available for transplant .  This acinar tissue that accompanies 
the islets may have a detrimental impact on the islet graft in the peri -transplant period.  Co- transplantation of 
islets with acinar tissue in impure preparations causes islets to be surrounded by [CONTACT_283347] l vein 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037]. The active proteolytic enzymes released from the acinar tissue (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase) 
continuously degrade insulin produced from the islet cells, which may negatively impact early glycemic control.  
More importantly, acinar proteases may be directly damaging to the transplanted beta cell.  In a recent analysis of 110 islet after kidney trans plantations performed within the Nordic Network for Clinical Islet Transplantation, 
for every milliliter of exocrine tissue transplanted, there was a reduction in islet graft function equivalent to a loss 
of 100,000 IEQ (48).  Protease exposed human islets show insulin degranulation and microstructural damage on 
electron microscopy (41), with a reduction of insulin granules and broken beta cells compared to intact beta cells 
and insulin granules in untreated isolated islets (electron microscopy figure below) .

Preclinical data in mice  and non- human primates  demonstrates dramatic ally increased rates of diabetes 
reversal with marginal mass islet grafts when alpha -1 antitrypsin therapy is administered; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_283280] a benefit when endogenous A1AT levels are elevated  
Preclinical trials in which a short duration course of A1AT is administered in the immediate post-operative period demonstrate clear efficacy in both allogeneic and syngeneic murine transplant models  (32-34, 40, 43).  C57BL/6 
mice that were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin exhibited prolonged islet allograft survival when treated with 
human A1AT compared to an untreated control group, lasting until the time of development of human A1AT 
antibodies.  Reduced neutrophilic inflammation was observed in the islet grafts of A1AT treated mice at 24 and 
48 hours after transplant compared to controls ( 33).  A second study confirmed these findings—streptozotocin-
induced diabetic mice that were treated with human A1AT exhibit superior islet allograft survival, in a dose -
dependent fashion, with mice treated for 30 days having superior outcomes (100% 30 day gr aft survival) 
compared to those treated for 14 days (50% diabetes reversal) compared to no diabetes reversal in untreated (34).  
Grafts of treated mice had low levels of expression of pro -inflammatory mediators/cytokines ( 34).  
Streptozotocin- induced diabetic mice genetically programmed to express human A1AT exhibited prolonged 
survival (>100 days) of islet allografts whereas control animals and those treated with inactive truncated A1AT 
rejected islets within 10 days, supporting a role for the active A1AT ( 32).   
 Notably, these findings have been  confirmed in a syngeneic non-autoimmune  model (43) and in non-human 
primate autografts  (49).  C75BL/6 mice receiving syngeneic marginal mass islet grafts — a scenario analogous to 
clinical islet autograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], who lack immunogenicity and often receive marginal mass islet grafts --- 
exhibited superior islet graft survival when treated with A1AT (Aralast). Of those treated with A1AT, 100% had 
islet graft function at day 3, compared to 10% in the placebo group, and 70% retained graft function for [ADDRESS_345783] 
islets at day 3, with highly reduced apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 detected in only 5% of the islets of A1AT treated 
vs 70% of control islets).   More critically, these results were replicated in non -human primates receiving marginal 
mass islet autografts infused intraportally following subtotal pancreatectomy and streptozotocin treatment ( 49
).  
Because these are autografts, and the infusion is intraportal, the clinical TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283281].   In 
this study, all 5 monkeys treated with  4 doses of  A1AT over 2 weeks (day -[ADDRESS_345784] -transplant at 60 
mg/kg IV) maintained normoglycemia off insulin for >1-3 years (no failures to date of publication), where as all

In a small cohort of patients at our institution, endogenous alpha -1 
antitrypsin levels were higher in those patients who subsequently 
demonstrated superior islet graft function.  Islet graft function was 
measured at 3 months by C -peptide production from mixed  meal 
tolerance testing.  Those patients with high C- peptide levels (above the 
median) at 3 months versus low C -peptide levels (below the median) 
had higher endogenous alpha-[ADDRESS_345786] beta

Figure : Endogenous A1AT at day [ADDRESS_345787] discomfort, and dizziness (50).  Transmission of serious viral infection has not 
been reported.  The conventional replacement dose of A1AT studied in patients with pulmonary disease related to deficiency state is 60 mg/kg body weight infused intravenously once weekly.  However, higher doses  have 
been studied , up to 250 mg/kg for 2 consecutive weeks, with more potent suppression of neutrophil -mediated 
proteolysis (marker of lung inflammation) at the higher dose (51).  ClinicalTrials.gov cites 5 clinical trials 
evaluating A1AT in new onset type 1 diabetes, at doses as high as 90 mg/kg IV weekly, and in patients as young 
as 8 years of age ( 31).   
 
Etanercept  
Etanercept,  a TNF α inhibitor, targets this key inflammatory cytokine implicated in β -cell apoptosis, with  strong 
clinical evidence for efficacy based on studies in islet allotransplantation for type 1 diabetes  
Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein 
containing an extracellular ligand -binding 
portion of the TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG . Etanercept functions by 
[CONTACT_283348] α, thus preventing its interaction 
with the TNF α receptor.   
 
TNFα is a particularly appealing therapeutic 
target in TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283282].  Islet grafts themselves release TNF α in 
response to the stress of islet isolation (17, 23), 
in addition to the pro- inflammatory milieu of 
the post -operative patient.  TNF α is directly 
toxic to islets, and potentiates the effect of toxicity induced by [CONTACT_283349], including IL -1, as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_255702] (15, 27, 28
).  In vitro,  the addition 
of anti- TNFα inhibitor to islets in standard culture media reduced TNF α secretion by >60%, reduced beta cell 
apoptosis by 26%, and increased stimulated insulin secretion (16).  TNFα inhibitor therapy has been studied in 
murine models of islet transplantation and in non- controlled studies of islet allotransplantation, but these findings 
have never been translated to TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283276].  
 
In murine models, administration of a TNF α inhibitor prolonged islet allograft survival, shifted the circulating 
cytokines towards an anti -inflammatory profile, and increased expression of anti-apoptotic pathways within the 
islet graft (52).  In a separate study, when human islets were transduced via an adenoviral vector to express a 
soluble type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) immunoglobulin- Fc fusion transgene (TNFR -Ig), which 
blocks TNF signaling , these TNFR -Ig expressing islets were protected from cytokine -induced apoptosis in vitro,  
and when these islets were transplanted into a diabetic mouse model, insulin independence was successfully restored for longer durations than untreated islets (53). Etanercept therapy has been administered in several 
clinical trials of alloislet transplantation for type [ADDRESS_345788] immunosuppression (54-56) .  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283283] a [ADDRESS_345789] -transplant (50 mg on day 0, and 25 mg 
on days 3, 7, and 10).  In recent analyses conducted by [CONTACT_283350], patients who received etanercep t had significantly improved insulin independence rates up to [ADDRESS_345790] -operative 

13 
 stage, we postulated that TNF α inhibition led to better engraftment and survival of the transplanted beta cell mass, 
thus allowing longer duration of insulin independence over conventional immunosuppression alone ( 54, 57).  In 
a preliminary analysis of [ADDRESS_345791] -transplant 
were associated with lower C -peptide levels at 3 months (r= -0.38, p=0.2).   
 
Etanercept is FDA approved for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis 
and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults.  The standard adult dose for arthritic conditions is 50 mg once 
weekly, although doses as high as 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months are approved for treatment of severe plaque 
psoriasis.  Etanercept is FDA approved for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 2 years of age 
or older at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg weekly ( 50).  Clinical trials with etanercept have focused on these conditions and 
other immune, rheumatic, or skin disorders, in children and adults (58-68) .  The most common adverse events are 
injection site reactions.  Other potential safety concerns include risk for opportunistic infection, demyelinating disorder, or malignancy.  However, current long-term follow up studies suggest a favorable safety profi le, even 
with prolonged use (60, 69),   In 58 children treated with etanercept for JIA for up to 8 years under an open- label 
extension study, the overall rate of serious adverse events was low at 0.12 SAE per patient- year, with no cases of 
tuberculosis, opportunistic infection, lymphoma, other malignancy, or demyelinating disease observed over the 
study period (64).  Similar findings are reported in 380 adults treated for rheumatoid arthritis and followed for 5 
years ( 69)-- the most common adverse event was upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]; serious adverse events included 
one case of tuberculosis but no other opportunistic infections, blood dyscrasias, or demyelinating disease.   
 Etanercept has been studied in new onset diabetes mellitus as a strategy to preserve beta cell mass.  In a cohort 
of 18 children with new onset type 1 diabetes randomized to receive etanercept at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg twice 
weekly (maximum 25 mg twice weekly ) for 24 weeks, hemoglobin A1c was lower in treated subjects, and area 
under the curve for C- peptide from mixed meal tolerance testing increased by 39% at 24 weeks compared to a 
20% decrease in C -peptide in the placebo group, suggesting a beta cell- protective effect of etanercept  (70). 
 
Measures of islet function serve as surrogate measures of islet mass 
In order to adequately assess the impact of any therapy on islet engraftment, it is important to have endpoints that 
reflect islet mass. Because it is not possible to directly quantify the number of islets that engraft and survive in 
the liver post- transplant, we have carefully selected surrogate endpoints that reflect beta cell function and mass. 
We will assess several previously validated measures : 1) C-peptide response to a mixed meal tolerance test  
(MMTT) , 2) the acute C-peptide and insulin response to intravenous glucose tolerance (IVGTT), and glucose 
potentiated arginine-induced insulin secretion ( GPAIS ).   
 
The oral stimulus used most often in the TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283284] [ADDRESS_345792] High Protein or a similar 
beverage. The MMTT is an accepted  measure of beta cell function  in islet transplant and diabetes studies ( 7, 71, 
72), and it is simple to perform in the clinic setting. However, it may be less useful  than the intravenous stimuli 
as a direct measure of islet mass ( 73). I ntravenous stimuli —dextrose and/or arginine —have been shown to 
correlate with islet mass in animal and clinical transplant models  (74-76) .  Both the acute insulin response to 
glucose (AIRglu) derived  from the IVGTT and the maximal acute insulin response to arginine (AIRmax) 
measured  from GPAIS correlate strongly with transplanted islet mass in patients who maintain euglycemia long-
term ( 74).  While transplanted islet mass is not the same as engrafted islet mass, these studies were performed in 
patients who were specially selected from those with optimal long- term beta cell function, and so were likely the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283285] .  Thus, they appear to be reasonable  surrogate measure for engrafted beta cell 
mass.  Both measures were superior to a simple arginine stimulation test ( 22
). In allotransplant patients, the 
AIRglu and AIRmax at [ADDRESS_345793] 
performed early after transplant was predictive of key long -term clinical outcomes ( 22). 
 
Measures of islet loss 
14 
 Another approach to measuring engraftment is to use surrogate measures of islet loss.  Recently, a novel assay 
developed by [CONTACT_283351], measuring circulating levels of unmethylated insulin DNA as a measure of beta cell 
death, was validated in type 1 diabetes ( 77).  When studied in 80 diabetic patients (37 treated with teplizumab), 
researchers found that the levels of unmethylated insulin DNA were higher in new onset diabetics than in healthy controls, due to accelerated beta cell turnover.  Those type 1 diabetic p atients treated with teplizumab had lower 
levels of unmethylated DNA than the untreated patients, consistent with the observation that the teplizumab group 
preserved beta cell mass  and function (based on C -peptide secretion from MMTT).   In collaboration with [CONTACT_283393] , we have a novel opportunity to measure this marker in the early post -transplant period as a measure of 
islet loss.     
 Summary of significance  
Approximately 4 in every 10,000 persons  in the U.S. suffer from chronic pancreatitis, with few treatment options 
available (1).  Chronic pancreatitis can result from genetic or obstructive factors , trauma, or alcohol use, or, often, 
unknown causes ;  it is a disabling disease that affects many young adults with an otherwise long lifespan ahead 
of them.  While TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283286], application of this procedure is limited by [CONTACT_283352] (7, 19).  Success of the IAT is hampered by [CONTACT_283353]. In fact, 
insulin independence has been observed in low islet mass recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (<2500 IEQ/kg) (7), suggesting a high success 
rate could be achieved with a much lower number of islets if engraftment is optimized. Islet engraftment and 
surviving beta cell mass is compromised by [CONTACT_283354]. We have the opportunity to test the efficacy of two anti -inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], A1AT and etanercept, 
in patients undergoing TPI[CONTACT_50182].  This study will pave the way for a larger, definitive multicenter trial by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_283287]. While our study is focused on patients with pancreatitis at risk for 
surgical diabetes after TPI[CONTACT_50182], findings would  also be applicable to the field of islet allotransplantation for type 
[ADDRESS_345794] -transplant beta cell 
damage —TNF α—and thus may be more effective.  The most efficient approach to select the best therapy is to 
compare these two agents head -to-head.  Thus, we propose the following sub-hypothesis for the study: 
• Sub-hypothesis #1: The efficacy of etanercept will be superior to that of A1AT because  it specifically 
targets the cytokine most clearly implicated in beta cell apoptosis.  
• Sub-hypothesis #2:  The efficacy of A1AT will be superior to that of etanercept  because it both inhibits 
cytokine production and it blocks protease activity. 
Specific Aims  
Forty -five patients undergoing TP- IAT (day 0 ) at a single center will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive during the 
peri-operative period either: 1) etanercept  (50 mg SQ on day 0; 25 mg SQ on days 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21),  2) 
alpha -1 antitrypsin  (90 mg/kg IV infusion on days -1, and +3, 7, 14, 21, and [ADDRESS_345795]-transplant) or 3) standard 
care.   
SPECIFIC AIM #1:  To determine if anti -inflammatory treatment with etanercept or alpha -1 antitrypsin 
during the critical peri -transplant engraftment period improves islet engraftment and function after islet 
autotransplant , as assessed by [CONTACT_283326] C -peptide on mixed meal tolerance testing (oral stimuli), 
acute insulin response to glucose -potentiated arginine stimulation (IV stimuli), and insulin requirements at day 
[ADDRESS_345796] -transplant. The primary endpoint of the maximally stimulated acute in sulin response to arginine 
(AIRmax) from GPAIS  at day [ADDRESS_345797] promising therapeutic agent for further 
development and testing in a large randomized trial.  
SPECIFIC AIM #2:  To gather pi[INVESTIGATOR_283257]- term impact of etanercept or alpha -[ADDRESS_345798]-
transplant, as assessed by [CONTACT_283326] C -peptide on mixed meal tolerance testing (oral stimuli), acute 
insulin response to glucose -potentiated arginine stimulation (IV stimuli), and insulin requirements (units/kg/day) 
at [ADDRESS_345799] -TPI[CONTACT_50182].   In addition, insulin requirements and fasting/stimulated C -peptide by [CONTACT_283355] [ADDRESS_345800]-transplant. 
SPECIFIC AIM #3:  To evaluate the mechanistic effects of etanercept and alpha -1 antitrypsin on 
inflammation, islet cell viability/survival, and beta cell apoptosis.  This will be assessed by [CONTACT_283356] (a recently validated marker 
of beta cell death  in T1DM) in patient serum. 
The goal of the current research  is to select the anti -inflammatory agent with the greatest potential to preserve 
islet mass early after TPI[CONTACT_50182].   
 
  
[ADDRESS_345801] clinical criteria will be enrolled and  randomized 1:1:1 to three 
study arms:  
1) Alpha-1 antitrypsin ( A1AT ), 90 mg/kg/week IV, administered days -1, and +3, 7, 14, 21, and 28.   
2) Etanercept administered as 50 mg SQ prior to the islet infusion (day 0) and [ADDRESS_345802]-transplant.   
3) Standard TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283288] [ADDRESS_345803] -transplant for metabolic testing.  The maximally

requirements and fingerstick blood glucoses will be monitored throughout the study duration. Key secondary 
endpoints include the area under th e curve (AUC) for C -peptide from mixed meal tolerance testing, the acute 
insulin response (AIRglu) on IV glucose tolerance test, the acute C -peptide response to glucose (ACRglu) on 
IVGTT, and the maximally stimulated C -peptide response (ACRmax) from GPAIS at day [ADDRESS_345806] the basic clinically available measures of insulin use/dose, 
HbA1c, and simple fasting and stimulated glucose and C- peptide from a mixed meal test annually for years [ADDRESS_345807]-transplant , all part of the patients’ routine cares.

 Study Treatment  
Study drugs : The two investigational agents administered in this study are as follows: 
1) Alpha-1 antitrypsin (Aralast NP) intravenously at a dose of 90 mg/kg IV weekly.  Treatment will be started 
1 day  prior to surgery and on days +3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after infusion.  This is infused as a rate of no more 
than 0.2 mL/kg body weight/minute, and may be slowed depending on patient tolerability. 
2) Etanercept:  dosing in adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283289] 50 mg SQ on day 0, and 25 mg SQ on days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21.   
 
All medication doses will be administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (during post -operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or in the research 
center by [CONTACT_283358].   
 
Randomization  Patients will be randomized to one of the three arms in a 1:1 :[ADDRESS_345808] care .  Randomization will be stratified on BMI (< or >27 kg/m2).  The investigational pharmacist  will 
dispense study medication according to the randomization schedule provided by [CONTACT_46134].  Because of 
the nature of the drugs, given intravenously and subcutaneously, this initial study will not be blinded , to minimize 
the burden on participant s.   
 
Rationale for study drug dosing regimen  
Alpha- 1 antitrypsin doses of 90 mg/kg/week are currently administered in 8- [ADDRESS_345809] in New Onset Diabetes (RETAIN), sponsored by [CONTACT_122845], Immune Tolerance 
Network, and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.  This is a dose that has been administered without serious adverse events to adults and children (down to 8 years of age) in the RETAIN trial (personal communications, Drs. Kevan Herold and Eva Tsalikian). Although there are multiple clinical grade A1AT products, Aralast was 
selected for this trial based on: 1) pre- clinical studies which have primarily used Aralast; and 2) use of Aralast 
NP in clinical trials in new onset type [ADDRESS_345810] -transplant has been 
observed to be efficacious in murine models of islet transplantation, with benefits sustained beyond the period of 
treatment , and even 14 days of treatment (4 doses) was effective in permitting long- term survival of marginal islet  
mass grafts in non- human primates (49). Thus, we have focused therapy specifically in this early post -islet 
infusion period where it is likely to yield benefit, in the first one month after islet infusion.  The first [ADDRESS_345811]-transplant in clinical TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283290] -term outcomes.   Clinically, C -peptide to glucose 
ratios (SUITO index) at [ADDRESS_345812] achievement of insulin independence in auto and allo -islet transplantation (22, 78, 
79).  Thus, establishing early engraftment is key to improving later success.  The short- term post- operative 
treatment duration proposed for this clinical trial targets this critical period of early islet engraftment —by 
[CONTACT_283359] -term peri -transplant treatment, we expect to achieve superior long- term 
metabolic outcomes.    Etanercept has been administered as part of multiple clinical trials in allotransplantation.  The dosing regimen is 
extrapolated from the experience with islet allotransplantation, in which doses are administered on day 0, 3, 7, 
and 10.  Although this short duration of treatment appears efficacious in islet allotransplantation, because TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283291] a more significant surgical procedure than those patients who receive a cadaveric donor alloislet 
infusion for type 1 diabetes (a relatively minor proc edure with rapid recovery), we have extended the treatment 
duration in the TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283292] 21 days.

SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT  PROCESSES 
Study subject recruitment and rationale for study site  
Subjects will be recruited from patients who are scheduled to undergo TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283294].  
Importantly, all patients are screened  for TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283295], after review by a multi -
disciplinary committee to confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis, maximal medical 
management, and impaired quality of life 
and/or narcotic dependence, as previously described ( 19).   
 The University of Minnesota (UMN) performs 
the greatest number of islet autotransplants per 
year of any institution in the [LOCATION_002], making it an ideal site for a clinical trial in this 
population. Since 1977, over [ADDRESS_345813] been performed, with an 
anticipated patient volume  of 55-60 
patients/year.  The patient volume by [CONTACT_283362] [ADDRESS_345814]  60% of our TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283296], or ~33subjects per year will meet eligibility criteria for the proposed trial.  We anticipate enrolling 45 
participants  over 2.5- 3 years  based on our prior experience with drug- treatment clinical trials in adults ( 25- 30 
patients enrolled per year) .  Patient interest in study participation has been very high.  Patients from this population 
are interested in clinical trials for several reasons, including  an altruistic desire to help others who have suffered 
with similar chronic disease.   
 The multidisciplinary UMN team has complementary expertise in medical and surgical management of chronic 
pancreatitis, diabetes, metabolic testing of islet mass and function, and manufacturing and testing of human islet 
products.  It is in a unique position to help improve islet transplant protocols for both auto- and alloislet transplant.  
 Description of the recruitment process  
Recruitment plan  
Patients will be recruited from the pool of eligible participants scheduled for total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant at the University of Minnesota (UMN).  These patients are known to the PI, as a member of the 
TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283297].  Potential surgical pati ents undergo a comprehensive multi -disciplinary evaluation at UMN at an 
initial consult visit.  Participants will be informed of the study by [CONTACT_102]’s physician (medical doctor on the 
IAT team) or the transplant coordinator for the TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283298].  Patients will be 
offered a brief descriptive hand out for more information regarding the study.  It will be clearly emphasized that 
participation in not required to have TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283299].  Those interested in the study will be contact[CONTACT_283363], including risks and benefits of participation.  Patients 
will be provided with the informed consent document in advance of the initial visit to obtain informed consent.  Once the patients have reviewed the written description of the study, and after telephone conversation with the PI 

[ADDRESS_345815] from the study center for mileage and/or airfare, airport transportation, meals ($25/day), and hotel up to a total maximum reimbursement for travel of $750 per visit at the day 90, 365, and 730 follow up visit s (when the extended metabolic testing is performed).   
Screening can be coordinated during the patient’s preoperative visit in the week prior to surgery; however, because this will often require one additional night in Minnesota, we will provide reimbursement for one night’s 
hotel, up to $250.  In addition, because the metabolic tests are cumbersome, time consuming, and require a 
morning off of work, both local patients and those who travel will be given a stipend of $50 per study day ($100 
total for 2 days) for completing the metabolic testing at each follow up interval.  This is consistent with standard 
stipends provided to participants in diabetes studies at our institution.  
 
Recruitment and advertisement materials  
The study will include a one page informational handout which briefly describes the purpose of the study and the 
medications being tested.  This hand out will include an “opt out” phone number that the patients can call if they 
do not wish to be contact[CONTACT_283364].  In addition, as per standard guidelines for clinical 
trials, the study will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov.  It will be clearly emphasized that participation in a study is not required to have TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283300]. 
 Description of the informed consent process  
As detailed in the preceding section , interested patients will be mailed a copy of the informed consent document 
to review prior to the informed consent visit.  Informed consent will occur when the patient returns for the 
screening study visit.  Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_34351], or one of the co-investigators.  Because this is a treatment study, a physician will always be involved in the initial informed consent process.  Following review of the study protocol and the informed consent document, patients’ understanding of 
the study will be assessed with directed questions, and informed consent will be confirmed and documented in 
the patient’s record.  The informed consent process w ill take place before any  protocol- driven  screening studies 
are done, and within 4 weeks of the patient’s surgery date.  The informed consent process will occur in the clinical research center within the University of Minnesota CTSI.    
Adults that are unable to consent for themselves due to developmental delay or severe psychiatric illness will not 
be recruited for this study. 
 
Because patients are sent the informed consent document prior to the informed consent visit, they are provided opportunity to review the study protocol including risks and benefits, in writing, prior to the consent visit.  Patients 
are encouraged to discus s the study details and informed consent with significant others, family, and their local 
physicians.   
 
Any significant changes in the risk profile of study medications, other risks, study medication administration, or testing/labs would prompt a change in the informed consent document.  Updated informed consent will be 
obtained at the patient’s next study visit, before any study testing is done.

 Design and Methods to Evaluate Specific Aim #1  
SPECIFIC AIM #1:  To determine if anti -inflammatory treatment with etanercept or alpha -1 antitrypsin 
during the critical peri -transplant engraftment period improves islet engraftment and function after islet 
autotransplant , as assessed by [CONTACT_283326] C -peptide (AUC C -pep) on mixed meal tolerance testing 
(oral stimuli), acute insulin response to glucose -potentiated arginine stimulation ( AIRmax, IV stimuli), and 
insulin requirements at day [ADDRESS_345818]-transplant.   
Hypothesis 1:  Etanercept and A1AT groups will have higher  AIRmax per islet transplanted than the control 
group.   
Hypothesis 2:  Etanercept and A1AT groups will have higher acute insulin response to glucose (AIRglu), 
higher acute C -peptide response to glucose (ACRglu) and greater  AUC C -pep than the control group. 
Hypothesis 3:  A1AT group will have superior  AIRmax, AIRglu, and AUC C -pep compared to etanercept 
group, because A1AT has a more generalized effect on the inflammatory milieu.   
Hypothesis 4: Conversely, etanercept group will have superior  AIRmax, AIRglu, and AUC C -pep compared 
to A1AT group, because of the central role of TNF α in beta cell loss . 
 
There are reasons  to believe that either  of A1AT or etanercept may be superior to the other (hypotheses 3 and 
4), in view of their relative mechanism s.  Thus it is important to compare these two agents head- to-head, in 
order to select the more promising therapy.    
Definitions and procedures for metabolic assessments  
For this aim, patients will be asked to return for testing at day 90 +/ - 15 days after TPI[CONTACT_50182].  Patients will continue 
their basal insulin analog (if applicable) but will be instructed to withhold any rapid acting insulin in the [ADDRESS_345819]: 
1. Two Hour Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT):  Glucose and C -peptide are drawn at baseline and every 
half hour for [ADDRESS_345820] HP 6 cc/kg (max 360 ml), ingested within 5 min, after the time 0 blood draw. Area under the curve for glucose  (AUC glucose ) and C -peptide ( AUC C- peptide ) 
will be evaluated .  AUC C -peptide is the standard endpoint for assessment of beta cell function in the trial 
net studies for type 1 diabetes, and in the  alloislet transplant trials in the  Clinical Islet Transplant  
consortium.  Scheduled on a separate morning from the IVGTT and GPAIS testing.    An additional 2 mL 
plasma will be collected from each time point in a collection tube including protease and DPP -4 inhibitors; 
these samples will be stored for potential later analyses of incretin hormones and glucagon (which require 
the special inh ibitor cocktail to avoid sample degradation). 
2. S
imple intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) :  A bolus of 0.3 grams/kg of dextrose is administered 
at time 0 , and insulin, C -peptide, and glucose are sampled at times -10, -5, -1, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 
minutes.  The AUC for the 10 minute insulin values minus baseline are used to calculate the acute insulin response to glucose ( AIRglu ) and acute C -peptide response to glucose ( ACRglu ).  Glucose levels will be 
drawn additionally at +12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 minutes to calculate the glucose disposal rate (Kg=ln(glucose)/min x 100).   
3. * G
lucose potentiated arginine stimulation (GPAIS):  Immediately following the IVGTT  (at time +20 
minutes) , dextrose (D20%) is infused at a variable rate to maintain blood glucose at ~230 mg/dL until 
completion of the test .  Glucose levels are drawn and measured by [CONTACT_283365] [ADDRESS_345821] 30 minutes of continuous D20% infusion at target 
BG (~230 mg/dL) , baseline samples for glucose, insulin, and C -peptide are drawn (three samples  over 10 
minutes) , a bolus of 5 grams arginine is administered  (time 60 minutes) , and samples for glucose, insulin , 
and C -peptide are obtained  at 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 minutes after the arginine bolus.  Results are used to 
calculate the maximal potentiated arginine induced insulin secretion ( AIRmax ), a sensitive marker of beta 
cell mass , and the maximal C -peptide secretion ( ACRmax ). AIRmax is the *primary endpoint  for the 
study .  This is selected as the primary endpoint because it is the measure that most directly relates to islet 
mass in diabetes and transplant studies in humans and animal models. 
23 
 4. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM):  6 days of CGM monitoring (minimu m of 72 hours for endpoint 
inclusion) at day 90, 365, and [ADDRESS_345822] deviation, % of time in 
hypo- and hyperglycemia ( 80). 
5. Hemoglobin A1c level is measured as a marker of average glycemic control.  
6. Insulin use  is assessed from glucose and insulin diaries maintained by [CONTACT_283366] 14 consecutive days, 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_283302] 90.  Calculated as units/kg/day. 
7. H ypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] :  All severe hypoglycemic events will be recorded.  This is defined based on 
American Diabetes Association  criteria as a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] <54 mg/dL or (if not measured) 
associated with prompt recovery upon administration of glucose in which a patient is mentally or 
physically incapacitated and requires assistance from another person in order to treat hypoglycemia.   
8. H ealth related quality of life :  Assessed by [CONTACT_20763] -36, from which 8 subscale scores can be generated for 
physical and mental/emotional HRQOL, as well as standardized physical composite summary and mental 
composite summary scores.  In addition  specific diabetes burden will be assessed by [CONTACT_283367] (Diabetes Distress Scale ).  These instruments are administered as part of our standard follow 
up protocol in all TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283303] [ADDRESS_345823] a fasting C-peptide and fasting glucose drawn (as part 
of MMTT) , to calculate basic measures of early function, including: 1) Fasting C- peptide to glucose ratio; and 2) 
SUITO index (calculated as fasting C -peptide [ng/ml] / (fasting blood glucose - 63 [mg/dl]) × 1500) (78).   In 
addition , a random glucose and C- peptide level are obtained  at day [ADDRESS_345824] 4 times per day (pre-meal and bedtime).   Patients will be instructed  to send logs to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_283304].  Insulin doses are adjusted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_283305], to 
maintain the following goals: fasting glucose <126 mg/dL, 2 hours after a meal <180 mg/dL, and HbA1c <6.5%.  
Patients have HbA1c levels drawn quarterly for clinical monitoring (standard of care) . Any patient not meeting 
these goals off insulin is not considered insulin independent per protocol. 
 
Safety monitoring:   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_283306], 
as described in the human subjects monitoring plan.  The coordinator or investigator will collect a history for safety assessment at day 60 (may be done by [CONTACT_283368]).  
Additional monitoring for safety will include history at each scheduled visit day 0- 30 for symptoms of DVT or 
PE (using Wells criteria) with lower extremity ultrasound or spi[INVESTIGATOR_283307] ( DVT ) in the lower extremities  (Well’s>2)  or pulmonary embolism ( PE) 
(Well’s >4)  respectively. Note that in this population all patients are expected to have a Wells score of 3 (meets 
‘moderate’ suspi[INVESTIGATOR_283308]) as 100% are immobilized and nearly 100% have intermittent tachycardia from 
pain and thus a score of [ADDRESS_345825] PE .  Likewise, 
the Well’s score of >2 accounts for the surgery, im mobilization and bilateral lower edema swelling (normal post -
TPI[CONTACT_50182]) that will occur in all patients.   At day 60, the telephone encounter will include assessment of symptoms 
for PE or DVT.   An EKG will be performed at baseline, day 28 and day 90. 
   
Design and Methods to Evaluate  Specific Aim # 2 
SPECIFIC AIM #2:  To gather pi[INVESTIGATOR_283257]- term impact of etanercept or alpha -[ADDRESS_345826]-
transplant, as assessed by [CONTACT_283326] C -peptide on mixed meal tolerance testing (oral stimuli), acute 
insulin response to glucose -potentiated arginine stimulation (IV stimuli), and insulin requirements (units/kg/day) 
at [ADDRESS_345827]- TPI[CONTACT_50182].  
24 
 Hypothesis 1: AIRmax, AIRglu, and AUC C -pep from metabolic testing performed at yearly intervals  post-
transplant will be greater in the A1AT -treated patients and etanercept-treated patients, compared to 
controls.   
Hypothesis 2:   Mean daily insulin requirements (units/kg/day) will be lower in the A1AT -treated  group vs 
control and in the etanercept treated vs control. 
Hypothesis 3: AIRmax and AIRglu at [ADDRESS_345828]-
transplant. 
For specific aim #2, patients will return to the study center at day 365 ± 28 days and 730 ± [ADDRESS_345829]-
transplant for repeat metabolic testing.  Testing performed will be identical to that described under approach for 
specific aim 1.   Both insulin use and the proportion of patients insulin independent will be recorded.    
 
As an exploratory analysis, patients will continue to be followed yearly by a telephone or face- to-face visit, 
depending on whether they are returning to UMN for clinical care, at which time mean daily insulin use will be recorded, and records will be reviewed for home blood glucometer results, hemoglobin A1c level, and mixed 
meal fasting and stimulated glucose and C -peptide performed at the patient’s local lab, per our usual routine for 
clinical follow up.   
 
In addition to the metabolic data collected under this protocol, all TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283309] a prospective 
follow up study tracking diabetes, pain, and health related quality of life outcomes on an ongoing basis.  Under 
this protocol, patients complete the SF-36 health related quality of life instrument and  institutional derived 
questionnaires that include self-report of daily insulin use, pain symptoms, and pain medications.  These 
instruments are administered at 3 months and 6 months after TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283310].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_283311].  These assessments will permit 
long-term follow up of the study participants for both insulin requirements and health- related quality of life 
outcomes. 
  
 
 
Design and Methods to Evaluate  Specific Aim #3  
SPECIFIC AIM #3:  To evaluate the mechanistic effects of etanercept or alpha -1 antitrypsin on 
inflammation, islet cell viability/survival, and beta cell apoptosis.  This will be assessed by [CONTACT_283369] (a recently 
validated marker of beta cell death  in T1DM) in patient serum during days 0 - 28. 
Hypothesis 1 :  Peak levels and area under the curve for inflammatory cytokines will be lower in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283312]- 1 antitrypsin  and etanercept.   
Hypothesis 2 :  Lower rates of beta cell death will be observed post -transplant in the A1AT -treated  and 
etanercept -treated  groups, compared to standard of care, as evidenced by [CONTACT_283370]. 
To evaluate the potential mechanistic effects of the two drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we will obtain frequent serum 
measurements in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283313]/chemokines and markers of coagulation 
(the instant blood mediated inflammatory reac tion), and markers of circulating exocrine tissue (trypsinogen) .  In 
addition, we will profile in each patient beta cell death (islet loss) using the novel marker for unmethylated insulin DNA.  Unmethylated insulin DNA is specific to beta cells, and elev ated levels in serum indicate beta cell death.  
Patient assessments are described in detail below.  
 
1) Patient assessments:  
a. Inflammatory Cytokines :  Patient serum will be assayed for TNF α, IL-1, IL-6, IL- 8, IL -10, MCP-1, 
IP-10, and CCL2—at pre -surgical  (x2 draws)  and pre-infusion baseline, and at times 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 
25 
 and 72 hours and  7 days after islet infusion. Assays will be performed using a Luminex  ® multiplex 
bead cytokine  kit. These measures were  selected based on the  literature suggesting relative 
importance in islet transplantation.  These assessments are run in a CLIA certified cytokine laboratory 
(University of Minnesota cytokine laboratory).  
In addition, thrombin-antithrombin complexes,  C3a, and C -peptide will be obtained  pre-infusion and  
at times [ADDRESS_345830]-transplant , as a marker of the instant blood mediated inflammatory 
response.     
b. Unmethylated insulin DNA :  This novel marker has recently been validated as a measure of beta cell 
loss in new onset type 1 diabetes.  Dying beta cells release unmethylated insulin DNA into the serum 
(43).  The assay technique is performed as described by [CONTACT_283351] (43).  DNA is purified from [ADDRESS_345831] -
transplant loss of beta cell mass. This marker will be drawn  prior to  surgery and infusion (x 2 samples)  
and at  [ADDRESS_345832] -transplant , and repeated 
at each follow up visit (90 day, 1 year, 2 year).   
c. A
lpha-1 antitrypsin levels :  Measured at pre -treatment and prior to each infusion in the A1AT -treated 
group.  In the control and etanercept groups, these levels will be measured at baseline and weekly 
through day 28 for comparison. 
d. T rypsin and Trypsinogen activated peptide (TAP) :  To determine if dying acinar cells release 
activated proteases which degrade the insulin molecules in systemic circulation, trypsin levels will be measured in the patient’s serum pre- and  at [ADDRESS_345833]- transplant by [CONTACT_283371] (
81).  TAP is a small, 
measureable peptide that is released when trypsinogen is activated to trypsin.   
e. Serum markers of hepatocyte, Kupffer, and sinusoidal endothelial cell injury :  Serum obtained at pre-
infusion baseline and at 3, 12, 24, and 72 hours, and 7 days after islet infusion will be used for  
assessment of markers of  liver cell injury, which may occur in islet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], especially 
when exocrine acinar tissue is co -transplanted with the islets.  We hypothesize that  A1AT  and 
etanercept  may reduce occurrence of acute liver injury  that is associated with islet infusion, and may 
thereby [CONTACT_283372] a more hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283314].   
i. CK-19 and CK-18 fragments, and additional serum markers such as F -protein, and 
Glutathione- S transferase can serve as markers of hepatocyte damage or death ( 82-84). 
ii. Hyaluronic acid, vWF, thrombomodulin, --  markers of sinusoidal endothelial injury ( 85).   
 
2) Islet graft and pancreas assessments:  
a. The islet isolation team will provide key descriptive data for  the islet product.  Because chronic 
pancreatitis may theoretically inflict damage on the isolated islets, these assessments will provide 
information on baseline  comparability  of the islet grafts  between the three  treatment  groups.  The 
following islet assessments will be performed using a small islet aliquot ( <2,000 IEQ total required 
combined for all assays) for all study participants:  
i. Islet count, expressed as total islet equivalents (IEQ) and IEQ/kg body weight, which is a 
routine measure for all clinical transplants .  
ii.   Oxygen consumption ratio (OCR) / viability : Assay method is refined from that described 
by [CONTACT_283373]  (86) and/or assessed by [CONTACT_283374]; this assay measures the 
viable islet tissue to be transplanted.  This has been shown to be a superior measure of islet 
viability over FDA/PI.   
iii. An aliquot of 500 IEQ islets and a pancreatic biopsy will be embedded into paraffin and 
available for analysis of insulin content, glucagon content, replication markers (Ki67), and 
apoptosis (TUNL).   
26 
 iv. Nuclei counts:  A nuclei count is performed using the digest counting sample. 
v. Beta cell count:  Derived from proportion of insulin -positive staining islet cells in the  
histopathology sample  (i.e. the fractional representation of beta cells in the graft) multiplied  
by [CONTACT_283375].   
 
 
 
SAMPLE SIZE  AND PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], parallel- arm study to compare etanercept, A1AT, and control groups; the primary outcome is 
maximal potentiated arginine induced insulin secretion ( AIRmax ) measured at 90 days posttransplant. We  
propose to enroll 15 patients in each group which will give 80% power to detect a difference between any two groups of at least 1.06*(within-group standard deviation of the outcome).  From preliminary data for AIRmax 
measured more than one year post- transp lant, the study will have 80% power to detect a difference of at least 33 
mU/mL in pairwise comparisons of AIRmax between each of the 3 groups, corresponding to a 24% increase over standard treatment (control group).   
 The table below shows estimated minimum detectable differences for main outcomes, based on means and 
standard deviations from preliminary testing performed at [ADDRESS_345834] -transplant (for IVGTT and MMTT) or 
beyond [ADDRESS_345835] transplant (GPI[CONTACT_113879]) in this population of TPI[INVESTIGATOR_283276].

We will also compare the groups based on the longitudinal series of measurements using 
a mixed -effects linea r model with fixed effects of treatment group, transplanted islet mass and randomization 
stratum, and a random intercept for each participant to model the correlation between repeated m easurements 
from the same person. 
 
 
POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Forseeable Risks  
Medical risks arise from two primary components of the study:  the study medications, and the islet functional (metabolic testing).  Non- medical risks include risk of breech of privacy. 
 
Risks of metabolic testing:   IV placement is required for study testing, and can be associated with bruising or 
discomfort.  The IV placement is done only by [CONTACT_283377][INVESTIGATOR_283315].  Because 
these patients have difficult IV access, the IV is often placed  by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_283316] 
[ADDRESS_345838], but this is transient ( <1 hours) and not as sociated with any long- term sequelae 
for the patient or islet graft .  Blood draws for both days of metabolic testing will total up to [ADDRESS_345839] -
transplant labs, and the three follow up visits for metabolic testing.  Subsequent to 2 years, only routine clinical yearly labs are obtained at the patient’s local laboratory (no additional study labs). 
 
Risks of study drugs :  The known potential risks of alpha -1 antitrypsin (Aralast NP) and etanercept are detailed 
in the table below, as described by [CONTACT_283378]/DRUGDEX.  Patients with the highest risk of an infusion reaction from A1AT —those with IgA deficiency (IgA level <5 mg/dL) —are excluded from this 
trial. 
 
Both products are overall well tolerated.  Aralast NP has been associated with elevation of liver enzymes, which were generally transient and normalized within [ADDRESS_345840] NP, in 11% 
of patients.  Other patient symptoms include headache, cough, muscle aches, and rash or pruritus.  Infusion 
reactions are rare.  Although other A1AT products have been associated with cough, sinus, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_037], this may be a manifestation of the underlying disease in the clinically treated population (A1AT 
deficient) and were not seen with Aralast NP.  
 
Etanercept (Enbrel) is generally administered long -term for management of autoimmune disease, particularly 
arthritis and psoriasis.  Treated patients often are pre -disposed to autoimmunity, are treated long- term with this 
agent, and often receive other imm unomodulating drugs.  Major differences in this trial as compared to the 
conventional use of this medication include the short -term duration of treatment and lack of other 
immunosuppressive treatments; this is expected to overall reduce the risk of infecti on and other serious adverse 
events.  Enbrel administration (long- term) for management of arthritis or psoriasis has been associated with 
increased risk of infection (including, rarely, tuberculosis and opportunistic infections) and sepsis.  Serious infect ious AEs most often occurred in patients who were treated with other concomitant immunosuppressive 
therapy; such drugs are prohibited in the current trial.  The drug is halted or interrupted in case of sepsis or other 
serious infection. 
 
The most common AE associated with Enbrel is injection site reaction (occurs in about 1/3
rd of patients).  Most 
cases are mild and do not necessitate drug discontinuation.  Mild infections --most frequently URI, and less often 
UTI, bronchitis, sinusitis -- are also commonly reported in treated patients.  Such infections were also present in 
a hig h frequency of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were on placebo treatment (infection in 32% of 
placebo patients vs 35% of Enbrel -treated).  Post -marketin g surveillance suggests a statistically higher incidence 
of tuberculosis (in 0.006- 0.02% of treated patients), and therefore patients are screened for latent TB at screening.  
There are case reports of more serious or unusual pathogens that are of unclear  relationship to Enbrel given the 
confines of few patient events and frequent co-administration of other immuosuppressives in these patients; these 
have included reports of septic arthritis, herpes zoster, legionella, pneumocystis, histoplasmosis, apergill osis, 
coccidiomycosis, and listeriosis.  DRUGDEX ® notes that according to the FDA adverse event reporting system (AERS) the majority of patients affected by [CONTACT_283379]. 
 Other potential serious adverse events associated with Enbrel include exacerbation of CNS demyelinating disease, 
hematologic cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, thromobocytopenia), and malignancy of unclear causal 
relationship.  To reduce risk in this trial, we are excluding patients with prior history of neurologic demyelinating 
disease, and patients with significant anemia (hgb<10), thrombocytopenia (plt<150), or neutropenia (<1.0).  
Given the short duration of treatment, we do not expect malignancy to be a significant concern in this population.  
Other case reports of rare congestive heart failure, one case of membranous glomerulonephritis, are of unclear 
[ADDRESS_345841] conditions for which Enbrel may be later indicated.

Risk of loss of privacy:  There is a risk that a subject’s study medical records will be viewed by [CONTACT_283380].  Precautions taken to avoid breach of privacy include using study ID numbers rather than names on 
labs/documents that are not a component of the clinical record, maintaining electronic records on password 
protected and secure computers serviced by [CONTACT_163673], and storin g 
study binders in a locked storage area within the PI’s locked office.  
 Only the primary investigator, co-investigators, and study staff (coordinators) will have access to the patient’s 
private study records.  As indicated above, some labs obtained as a part of the study will be posted to the medical 
[ADDRESS_345842] and may be viewed by [CONTACT_283381]’ caring for the patient in a clinical setting.  These will be limited to 
test results that are important component of the patient’s routine clinical care .   
 
Risk management and emergency response 
The primary investigator or one of the co- investigators will be on call for any medical concerns during routine 
study visits or infusion of the study medication.   Patients will receive emergency or first aid care if an injury or 
illness occurs during the study visit, or during medication infusion.  All doses of medication are administered in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283317], with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283318].    
 
If patients experience an illness or symptom between during the study that could be related to the study drug, they will be directed to receive routine clinical care from their primary physician.   
 
Potential Benefits:  
Direct benefits :  If the study treatment is successful, then those participants treated with study drug (A1AT or 
etanercept) may require less insulin or be more likely to come off insulin than those patients receiving standard care.   
 If the treatment is successful, the potential benefit of the study treatment is significant, including potential for  
reduced incidence of diabetes, or better controlled diabetes after surgery.  The total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant is a major surgical procedure.  Minor complications (including nausea/ vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, pain) are not uncommon and recovery is gradual. There is a high risk of partial or total diabetes.  A1AT 
or etanercept used only temporarily, and have relatively  few safety risks over this short duration of treatment .  
Thus, we expect the additional study treatment to contribute only minor risks compared to the overall risks of the total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant.  
 
Other benefits :  The knowledge gained from the extensive metabolic and islet graft assessments performed in this 
trial will advance the understanding of islet autotransplantation.   
  
ADVERSE EVENT DOCUMENTATION AND TERMINATION CRITERIA 
Adverse events:  All adverse events will be recorded for all subjects, and graded according to the CTCAE version 
4.0.  All AEs, regardless of severity will be collected from day 0 to the day 90 visit (drug exposure window).  
Subsequent to day 90, only severe AE’s (as subsequently defined) are collected, from day 90 to the final face to face visit at day 730.  AE’s include new or worsening symptoms reported by [CONTACT_423], signs on physical exam 
(performed at each study visit), and/or abnormalities on study l abs.  AE’s will be reviewed by [CONTACT_283382].  Serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB per institutional guidelines (within 10 days for an event that meets rapid reporting requirements), and to the DSMB and the FDA within 72 
hours in accordance with IND regulations.   
 Each event will be analyzed to determine is relatedness to study medication (definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated) and the severity will be graded as follows, modified from the Common Toxicity Criteria: 
• MILD (Grade 1) – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention require.  
• MODERATE (Grade 2) – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or 
minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
• SEVERE (Grade 3) – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]. 
• LIFE -THREATENING or DISABLING (Grade 4) – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]. 
• DEATH (Grade 5) – event is a direct cause of death.  
30 
 All adverse events will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe, according to the guidelines established in the 
current Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). 
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
Defined as any adverse event that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. This includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: 
1. Death: A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the investigator during the 
protocol- defined follow -up after the completion of therapy, whether or not considered treatment- related, 
must be reported. 
2. Life-threatening: Any adverse therapy experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death). 
3. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6. Other serious (Important medical events).  
 
 
Events of special interest:   Any infectious event will be specifically recorded, in as much detail as possible, for 
patients in all three study arms.  While the lack of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy and short duration of 
treatment with Enbrel is expected to result in a lower  risk of infection risk compared to that reported in post -
marketing studies (in patients with long- term treatment and other immunomodulators), we recognize that this 
patient population has special risks associated with the major surgical procedure.  As det ailed below, drug therapy 
will be suspended in the cases of sepsis or serious infection that requires procedural intervention for treatment; 
more than one such infection in a single treatment arm will prompt DSMB review. 
 
Regulatory oversight:   The study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_283383].  Because the drugs being studied are currently FDA -approved, we have 
requested the FDA to review our protocol to determine if it meets criteria for a new IND.  If the FDA determines that this protocol is non- exempt due to the unique patient population, we  will request an investigator -initiated 
IND from the FDA for etanercept and alpha -[ADDRESS_345843] at UMN.  In addition the DSMB will be contact[CONTACT_283384], within 72 hours of the event.  This is further described 
below. 
 
Clinical trial monitor :  A clinical trial monitor external to the study and not paid by [CONTACT_283385] (CTSI).  The study monitor will review study conduct every 6 months.  
The purpose of the CTSI clinical monitor is to verify that: (1) the rights and well- being of human subjects are 
protected ; (2) trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable; and (3) conduct of the trial is in compliance with 
GCP guidelines and with applicable regulatory requirements.  Activities of the CTSI monitor include (but are not 
limited to) review of facilities, storage and dispensing of investigational products, protocol compliance, informed consent, appropriate recruitment and screening of subjects, case report form s, accurate data recording, and adverse 
event reporting. 
 
 
 Drug or Study Termination 
Study drug termination in an individual patient: This is an intent -to-treat study.  Any patient treated with study 
drug will be followed for endpoint assessment (unless the patient withdraws from the study). 
 Study drug will be discontinued and the patient will continue to be followed for any of these events: 
31 
 • Serious allergic reaction  
• patient refusal to continue study drug (but willingness to continue with endpoint assessment) 
• ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_345844] and bilirubin >1.5x ULN.  Note that elevation in ALT and AST is expected to 
occur as a result of islet infusion itself.  However, bilirubin elevation is uncommon.  If ALT an d/or AST 
subsequently fall to <5x ULN and bilirubin to <1.5x ULN, the study drug will be resumed, if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], enzyme elevations were suspected secondary to the surgical procedure.    
• Serious infection including sepsis (positive blood culture  AND suspi[INVESTIGATOR_283319], need for vasopressors, or organ failure ; or significant physician concern for sepsis due to 
latter symptoms in the absence of a positive blood culture ) or intra-abdominal abscess requiring an 
operative intervention. Treatment will be temporarily held until the infection is adequately treated, and 
then resumed if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_217054]’s physician, it is safe to do so.    Hypotension and tachycardia 
are common on POD 0- POD 1, due to the surgery, and alone, would not necessitate halting therapy.  
Antibiotic prophylaxis is routinely given in this population. 
• Wound infection or minor infection – Superficial wound infections are relatively common in this 
population. In the etanercept arm only, etanercept will be held until infection is treated with antimicrobial 
therapy, per standard care with this agent.  
• Any diagnosis of malignancy 
• Any new diagnosis of CNS demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, transverse 
myelitis, or a new diagnosis of Guillan Barre. 
• Pregnancy (not expected in first few months after major abdominal surgery) 
• Other new medical condition which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372], or the patient’s surgical and medical team, present a contra-indication to continuing treatment. 
• Occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis  
• Occurrence of DVT or PE  
 
Study Termination/ Study arm termination :   If two or more patients in one arm experience any of the following 
safety events:  (1) documented  sepsis,  (2) an intra -abdominal infection that requires drainage and/or  operative 
intervention (excludes superficial wound infection) , (3) PE or DVT, or (4) diabetic ketoacidosis, all within the 
first 90 days of  surgery, the study will be temporarily halted, and the external DSMB will be asked to review the 
data.  The study arm in question (alpha -1 antitrypsin or etanercept) will be resumed only with permission from 
the DSMB.  If the DSMB deems that the serious infections were likely related to the study drug, no additiona l 
patients will be treated with this agent .  Any patient death, regardless of  relation to study drug will prompt halting 
of study pending DSMB review.     
 
The data safety and monitoring board for islet transplantation at the University of Minnesota is headed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Bruce Redmon.  The DSMB meets every 6 months to review all active islet transplant clinical trials.  The DSMB will review the study semi-annually, to ensure safety of the study participants.

Lab facilities  
The majority of lab assays will be run in the Fairview Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283321], affiliated with the University of Minnesota.  
However, the following are not available or are inadequate at the Fairview lab and will be run in the facilities described 
below:  
• Insulin levels (GPAIS and IVGTT):  To obtain accurate results in this population, we require an insulin 
assay that is resistant to interference from hemolysis.  Fairview does not offer an adequate assay for this purpose.  We will ship serum for insulin levels to the Northwest Lipid Research Laboratories at the 
University of Washington.  Timed test glucose and C -peptide measures will also be run at NWLRL due 
to their ability to handle such timed, repeated measures specimens.   
• Unmethylated insulin DNA: This specialized assay will be run by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kevan Herold’s lab at Yale 
University  
• Trypsinogen, TAP, and liver injury markers:  ELISA kits for the respective assays will be purchased and the laboratory assessments run by [CONTACT_283387]. Gregory Beilman’s lab.   
For labs that require shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], all specimens are labeled with the study ID number and contain no identifying 
information.  Specimens are shipped overnight by [CONTACT_283388].  All study personnel performing specimen 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_283322] a session offered to research staff at the University of Minnesota.  Appropriate precautions and labeling for biohazard materials are undertaken .

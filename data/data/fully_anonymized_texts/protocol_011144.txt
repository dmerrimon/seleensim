SYNOPSIS 
Study Number:  ICL-23-ABSSSI1  
Title of Study:  A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of intravenous iclaprim versus vancomycin in the treatment of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections suspected or confirmed to be 
due to Gram -positive pa thogens.  (REVIVE -1) 
Indication:  Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) suspected or 
confirmed to be due to Gram -positive pathogens . 
Number of 
Investigators and 
Study Centers:  Approximately 80 study centers in the [LOCATION_002], the EU, and other 
countries around  the world.  
Development Phase:  3 
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
The primary objective  of this study is to  demonstrate that iclaprim is 
non-inferior to vancomycin in achieving a ≥20% reduction in lesion size at 48 
to 72 hours (Early Time Point  [ETP] ) compared to baseline in all randomized 
patients (ITT). 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this study are to demonstrate non -inferiority of  
iclaprim compared to vancomycin in the ITT , mITT , mCE, PP, and mPP  
populations for the following:  
1. Resolution or near resolution of ABSSSI (clinical cure, defined by a 
≥90% reduction in lesion size from the size at baseline, no increase in 
lesion size sinc e ETP, and no requirement for additional antibiotics 
[except aztreonam and metronidazole] or unplanned significant 
surgical procedures  after ETP other than bedside wound care ) at Test 
of Cure (TOC) visit (7 to14 days after the end of treatment);  
2. Resolution  or near resolution (≥90%) of ABSSSI at End of Therapy 
(EOT);  
3. Resolution or near resolution (≥90%) of ABSSSI at EOT and TOC 
among patients with severe infection at baseline defined by [CONTACT_94143]: 
a. fulfilled the published d efinition for systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (SIRS) by [CONTACT_7661] ≥2 of the following 
findings: body temperature >38°C or <36°C,  heart rate >90 
bpm,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] >20 breaths/minute, and   WBC 
>[ZIP_CODE]/mm3 or <4000/mm3 or >10% bands;  
b. Evaluated as having severe tenderness or severe erythema at 
the infection site; and  
c. Positive blood cultures at baseline.  
4. Time to resolution of systemic and local signs and symptoms of 
ABSSSI . 
Additional secondary objective s are to:  
5. Assess m icrobiological outcome in the  mITT , mCE , and mPP 
populations at EOT and TOC ; 
6. Establish the PK profile for iclaprim using population  
pharmacokinetics ; and  
7. Establish the safety profile of iclaprim in patients with ABSSSI . 
Study Population:  Patients  ≥18 years of age of either gender with ABSSSIs suspected or 
confirmed to be due to Gram -positive pathogens . 
Methodology/  
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind study of the efficacy and safety 
of iclaprim compared to vancomycin. Pa tients will receive either iclaprim or 
vancomycin for 5 to 14 days. Patients will be evaluated daily up to ETP, then

Motif BioSciences  Clinical Protocol  Protocol /Amendment  No.: 
Iclaprim  ICL-23-ABSSSI1 -[ADDRESS_1001624] dose of study drug 
falls on a day when an evaluation was not planned, an add itional evaluation visit 
will need to be performed on that day (ie. All EOT evaluations should be 
performed on the last day [+2 days ] of drug dose).  Patients will also be 
evaluated at the TOC visit ([ADDRESS_1001625] -EOT), and will have  a Late 
Follow -Up (L FU) phone call  ([ADDRESS_1001626] dose ). 
 
After completing screening procedures, including obtaining cultures from a clinical specimen prior to antibacterial therapy, a total of 600 patients (300 per 
treatment group) will be randomized (1:1) to rece ive either: (1) iclaprim 80 mg 
every 12 hours or (2) weight -based vancomycin.  The duration of treatment for 
both groups will be 5 days (minimum duration) to 14 days  (maximum duration) . 
 
The investigators, clinical study personnel, sponsor , and the patients will remain 
blinded with respect to the study drug treatment allocation. The unblinded 
pharmacist or his/her designee will be responsible for preparation of infusions. 
Normal saline dummy infusions will be used to maintain the blind where  
vancomycin is dosed at a different interval than q12h.   
 
For patients in whom Gram staining  of culturable material or cultures indicates 
that Gram -negative coverage is required, and  for patients in whom anaerobic 
pathogens are suspected or confirmed as p athogens at the  infected site, 
aztreonam and metronidazole may be administered, respectively.  Concomitant 
antibiotics aztreonam and metronidazole will be used in compliance with their 
respective prescribing information at the discretion of the investigator  during 
the study treatment phase.  
 
Systemic antibiotics (other than aztreonam and metronidazole) or topi[INVESTIGATOR_94118], steroids >20 mg/day 
prednisolone or equivalent; and Type I A and Type III -antiarrhythmic  drugs are 
prohibited.  
 
Clinical Assessments:  
 
The primary endpoint for clinical response (defined as  the reduction in lesion 
size ≥ 20% compared to baseline) will be evaluated in all randomized patients at 
ETP ([ADDRESS_1001627] dose) . Patients who have died or who received 
rescue antibacterial therapy prior to that time will be included as treatment 
failures. In addition, clinical outcome will be evaluated by [CONTACT_733125] ([ADDRESS_1001628] EOT). The assessments of clinical outcome 
will be categorized as cure, failure, or indeterminate . 
 
Microbiological Assessments:  
 
An adequate clinical specimen for microbiologic evaluation will be obtained at 
baseline prior to randomization.  Additional clinical specimens will be ob tained, 
if clinically feasible and if the patient has persistent clinical signs or symptoms, 
at ETP , EOT and TOC. If the patient is discontinued from the study due to 
treatment failure, a clinical specimen will be obtained at that time . Specimens 
will be e valuated by [CONTACT_94145]; in addition, isolates will 
be subcultured and sent to a central microbiology laboratory for confirmation of 
pathogen identity and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). 
 
Two sets of blood samples for aerobi c/anaerobic cultures  [ADDRESS_1001629] 
dose of  study drug . Blood cultures from intravascular devi ces are not permitted.

Any potential pathogen will be subcultured and the isolates shipped to the 
central laboratory.  Anti-streptolysin O titers will also be taken within 24 hours 
of the start of treatment.  
 
Microbiological response will be assessed at the patient level and at the 
microbiological  level on the basis of  results of the cultures, the susceptibilities 
of identified organisms, and the clinical outcome of the patient. Microbiological 
response by [CONTACT_94146], EOT , and TOC visits and 
categorized as eradication, presumed eradication, persis tence, presumed 
persistence, indeterminate , superinfection , or recurrent infection  in patients with 
a Gram -positive pathogen isolated at baseline . 
 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from patients on [ADDRESS_1001630] their samples assayed . 
 
Safety and tolerability assessments:  
 
All patients who re ceive any study drug will be evaluated for safety on the basis 
of medical history and physical examinations, reports of clinical AEs, routine 
electrocardiography, and clinically significant findings from routine liver 
function tests, serum chemistry, hemat ology, coagulation, and urinalysis ( UA) 
tests.  All a dverse events will be recorded throughout the study period, up to and 
including the LFU  phone call . While blinded to treatment assignment, the 
investigator will categorize the severity of each AE and the potential for 
relationship to study drug. Serious AEs (SAEs) include  those that were life 
threatening, led to prolongation of the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect,  or caused persistent or significant disability, incapaci ty, or 
death. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be defined as those that start or 
worsen in severity during or after the first dose of study drug admi nistration 
through end of study.  
Number of Patients 
(planned and 
analyzed):  A total of 600 patients ( approximately 300 per treatment group ) will be 
randomized (1:1) for this study.  
 
Using Farrington and Manning’s method for non -inferiority (NI) testing with a 
1 sided alpha of 0.025, assuming a 75% early clinical response rate in each 
group and a 10% non -inferiority bound delta, a sample size of 295 ITT patients 
per treatment group is required for 80% power. In addition, using similar 
methods of NI testing with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, assuming a 90% early 
clinical response rate at TOC in each group and a 10% NI bound delta, a sample 
size of 300 patients in the ITT population per treatment group  is required for 
82% power. If the initial endpoint of clinical response at ETP does not achieve 
statistical significance, no further statistical testing will be done.

Exclusion Criteria:  The following are the main exclusion criteria:  ABSSSI of the following 
categories : severely impaired arterial blood supply such that a mputation of the 
infected anatomical site is likely, infected diabetic foot ulcers, i nfected 
decubitus ulcers, infected human or animal bites, necrotizing fasciitis or 
gangrene, uncomplicated skin or skin structure infection, s elf-limiting 
infections , skin and/or skin structure infection that can be treated by [CONTACT_94148], infections associated with a pros thetic device, and s uspected or 
confirmed osteomyelitis ; known or suspected concurrent infection or conditions 
requiring systemic anti -microbial treatme nt, prophylaxis, or suppression 
therapy ; received  more than one dose of a short -acting (i.e., q12h dosing or less) 
systemic antibiotic(s) active against Gram -positive pathogens within the last 7 
days, unless there is documented evidence of treatment failure OR demonstrated 
resistance of Gram -positive pathogens to the prior antibiotic therapy . 
Study Medications:  Iclaprim will be administered at a dose of 80 mg in 500 mL normal saline, 
infused over 2 hours  q12h (every 12 hours)  for 5 to 14 days.  For subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class B ), iclaprim will be 
administered at a dose of 40 mg in 500 mL normal saline, infused over 2 hours 
q12h for 5 to 14 days.  
 
Vancomycin will be dosed as follows: 15  mg/kg  body weight in  500 mL  normal 
saline  infused over 2 hours for 5 to 14 days.  Dosing interval will be every q12h, 
q24h, q48h, or dosed by [CONTACT_94149] . Patients 
randomized to vancomycin who require dosing intervals of q24h, q48h, or 
dosed by [CONTACT_733126] 
(normal saline) at 12 hour intervals when they are not to receive vancomycin.  
 
Vancomycin dosing will be adjusted based on trough levels  to maintain a trough 
of either 10 to 15 mg/L for patients with an organism whose  MIC  is ≤1 mg/L or 
15 to 20 mg/L for patients with  an organism whose  MIC  is >1 mg/L . Dose 
adjustments made due to t rough monitoring  will need to be performed in such a 
manner as to ensure that the blind is maintained.  Normal saline d ummy 
infusions will be used to maintain the blind  for patients randomized to 
vancomycin who have a dosing frequency other than Q12h . 
Dose and Regimen:  Iclaprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor being studied for the treatment of 
ABSSSI. The dosing re gimen of iclaprim is 80 mg q12h  via an intravenous 
administration . Each dose will be infused over 2 hours , and the duration of 
treatment will be 5 days (minimum duration ) to 14 days (maximum duration).  
Duration of 
Treatment:  The total duration of treatment in the study for each patient  is 5 to 14 days.  
Duration of Patient 
Participation in 
Study:  The total duration of participation in the study for each patient is 29 to 33  days.

Study Populations:  Intent -to-treat (ITT) popul ation — All randomized patients (primary population 
for efficacy analyses).  Patients will be analyzed in treatment group to which 
they were randomized.  
 
Microbiological intent -to-treat (mITT) population — All randomized patients 
who have a Gram -positive  baseline bacterial pathogen identified as the cause of 
ABSSSI.  
 
Modified clinically evaluable (mCE) population consists of all patients 
excluded from the PP population only because they ha ve received prohibited  
concomitant or preceding antibiotic therapy  active against Gram -positive 
pathogens . 
 
Per-protocol (PP) population — ITT patients who receive at least 80% of their 
planned doses and provide adequate data for assessment for each of the 
following timepoints: ETP, EOT and TOC . This excludes patients wi th 
Gram -negative bloodstream infections who were discontinued in order to treat 
the Gram -negative  pathogen . 
 
PP microbiologically evaluable population  (mPP ) — mITT  patients who receive 
at least 80% of their planned doses and provide adequate data for asses sment for 
each of the following timepoints: ETP, EOT , and TOC . 
 
Safety population — All patients who receive any study drug during the trial 
(primary population for safety analyses).  Patients will be analyzed according to 
the treatment they received.  
Evaluation: Efficacy  The primary efficacy endpoint  is the proportion of  randomized  patients who 
achieve an early clinical response (defined as  reduction in the lesion size ≥ 20% 
compared to baseline) at 48 to 72 hours (ETP) and will be evaluated among all 
randomized patients (ITT population).  The primary efficacy analysis will be the 
non-inferior ity (NI) of iclaprim (group  1) to vancomycin (group  2) for the 
proportion of patients with a ≥ 20% reduction in lesion size at ETP compared to 
baseline.  
 
The primary  NI efficacy analysis will be repeated in the mITT , mCE, the PP, 
and the mPP  populations  as secondary outcome s. 
The secondary endpoints are : 
1. Resolution or near resolution of ABSSSI ( ie, clinical cure, defined by a 
>90% reduction in lesion size from the size at baseline, no increase in 
lesion size since ETP, and no requirement for additional antibiotics 
[except aztreonam and metronidazole] or unplanned significant 
surgical procedures  after ETP other than bedside wound care ) at TOC 
for iclaprim ( 80 mg q12h) compared with vancomycin ( weight -based 
dose) for ITT, mITT , mCE, PP, and mPP  populations  
2. Resolution or near resolution (≥90%)  of ABS SSI at EOT  for ITT, 
mITT , mCE, PP, and mPP  populations  
3. Resolution or near resolution (≥90%)  of ABS SSI at EOT  and TOC 
among patients with severe infection at baseline for ITT, mITT,  mCE  
PP, and mPP populations

mCE,  and mPP  populations  
6. Pathogen -level  bacteriological response rate  at EOT and TOC  for 
mITT , mCE,  and mPP  populations  
Evaluation: Safety  Treatment emergent AEs, SAEs, hematology, clinical chemistry, UAs, vital 
signs, physical ex aminations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) , and liver function 
tests will be evaluated.  
Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics  Iclaprim plasma concentrations will be used to determine population PK 
parameters, including C max, AUC to infinity (AUC 0-∞), clearance, and volume of 
distribution . Interindividual  variability (IIV) will be determined for PK 
parameters , as well as  residual variability. The potential influence of clinical  
characteristics (age, size, sex, hepatic function, renal function, concomitant 
medications,  etc.) on PK parameters will be evaluated.  Further details will be 
detailed in a separate population PK analysis plan.  
Statistical Methods:  In general, statistical tests will be two -sided, and at the level of significance 
alpha = 0.05. The non-inferior ity assessment will be made with a one -sided test 
at significance level of 0.025. Confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated at a 
95% confidence level.  
 
Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_733127] ( N), mean, standard deviation  (SD), median , 
and range , and categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_22136] N 
and percentage.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be the NI (at significance level 0.025 ) of 
iclaprim (group 1) to vancomycin (group 2) for the proportion of ITT patients 
with a ≥20% reduction in lesion s ize at ETP compared to baseline. The NI 
bound will be 10%. Let P1 be the proportion for iclaprim and P2 be the 
proportion for vancomycin. Equi valently, if the lower bound of the two -sided 
95% CI for P1 – P2 is greater than -0.[ADDRESS_1001631] with unpooled 
variance estimate, NI will be concluded.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
 
The primary NI efficacy analysis will be repeated in the mITT , mCE, the PP, 
and the mPP  populations. The secondary endpoints are resolution or near 
resolution of ABSSSI ( ie, clinical cure) at TOC for iclaprim (80 mg q12h) 
compared with vancomycin ( weight -based dose ), resolution or near resolution 
(≥90%)  of ABS SSI at EOT, resolution or near resolution (≥90%)  of ABS SSI at 
EOT  and TOC among patients with severe infection at baseline, time to 
resolution of signs and symptoms of ABSSSI, by -patient bacteriological 
response rate  at EOT and TOC , and by -pathogen bacteriological response rate  at 
EOT and TOC . 
 
Safety Analyses:  
 
All patients who received any amount of iclaprim or vancomycin  during the 
trial will be evaluated for safety. Safety evaluation include incidence of TEAEs, 
laboratory test results  (including liver function tests) , vital signs, ECG results, 
and physical examination findings. All summaries of safety data will be based

on the safety  population  (all treated patients) . No formal statistical analysis of 
the safety data will be performed.  
Summary tables will be provided for all AEs by [CONTACT_1570]. The incidence 
of AEs, related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of the study 
treatment will be presented by [CONTACT_733128] (SOC) and preferred ter m. In addition, the incidence of AEs 
by [CONTACT_94153].   
The AE summary tables will include patient counts . Therefore, if a patient 
experiences more than one epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a particular AE, the patient will be 
counted only  once for that event. If a patient has more than one AE that is coded 
to the same preferred term, the patient will be counted only once for that 
preferred term. Similarly, if a patient has more than one AE within a SOC, the 
patient will be counted only onc e in that SOC.  
Laboratory test variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_72082] (number of patients, mean, SD, minimum, maximum, as well as mean change from baseline, SD 
for mean and standard error for mean 
change, min imum, median, maximum, and number and percent of patients 
within specified categories).  Shift tables (ie, cross -tabulations of below the 
lower limit of the normal range, within the limits of the normal range and above 
the upper limit of the normal range at  baseline versus scheduled visits) will be 
presented by [CONTACT_94155].  Laboratory tests with categorical results that 
cannot be analyzed by [CONTACT_94156], but will be listed.  Data obt ained from laboratory 
tests not required by [CONTACT_94157], but will be listed.  
Descriptive statistics of vital signs and ECG results at each visit will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  Physical examination findings will be listed for  
each patient.

5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections  
Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSIs ) are predominantly caused by [CONTACT_94163] -positi ve pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus , including  methicillin -resistant staphylococci  (MRSA), 
beta hemolytic streptococci (most commonly  S. pyogenes  and S. agalactiae ), enterococcus spp., and 
viridans group streptococci.  
Due to the rapid emergence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - and community -acquired strains of resistant  bacteria, there is an 
urgent need to identify and develop compounds that are active  against drug -resistant and emerging 
pathogens, such as MRSA, which are associated with  increased rates of morbidity and mortal ity and , 
therefore , with significantly increased  pharmacoeconomic costs.  
5.2 Properties of Iclaprim  
Iclaprim ( MTF -100) is a potent and selective inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)  of important 
bacterial pathogens, including antibiotic -resistant strain s. Iclaprim inhibits human DHFR minimally, 
resulting in a selectivity index of more than  4 orders of magnitude. These results, together with more than 
2 decades of clinical  experience with trimethoprim (a related diaminopyrimidine), provide the proof of  
concept that selective DHFR inhibitors are safe and efficacious.  
A major advantage of iclaprim over many existing antibiotics is its potent bactericidal  activity against a 
broad spectrum of Gram -positive bacteria, including MRSA,  vancomycin -intermediate  S. aureus , 
vancomycin -resistant enterococc i (VRE), and quinolone -resistant strains. Moreover, iclaprim exhibits 
potent activity against most  trimethoprim -resistant strains. Iclaprim is active against the majority of the  
Gram -positive pathogens in ABSSSI.  
Further details about iclaprim can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

administered by [CONTACT_108967] ( IV) or oral  (p.o.) routes in in vivo rodent infection models.  
In a 4 -week toxicity study in male and female rats, single daily IV bolus doses up to  60 mg/kg were given. 
Little evidence of systemic toxicity was observed, even at the  highest dose tested (60 mg/kg/day). 
However, poor loc al injection site tolerability  precluded the determination of a no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL). However,  the Non -Toxic -Effect level was at least 30 mg/kg/day. In a 4 -week toxicity 
study in male  and female marmosets, single daily infusions up to 3 0 mg /kg over 20 minutes were well  
tolerated, with the exception of a slight irritation response at the injection site. Therefore,  the NOAEL was 
considered to be 30 mg/kg/day.  
In safety pharmacology studies with IV bolus doses up to 30 mg/kg in rats,  no behavioral  changes or effects

5.3.2 Phase 1 Clinical studies  
Iclaprim has been administered in single -dose studies up to 3.2 mg/kg and in repeated escalating IV dose 
studies up to 1.6 mg/kg.  
Following IV administration, iclaprim rapi[INVESTIGATOR_94119] a terminal 
elimination half -life of about 3 hours. Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties  are independent of the dose; 
maximum concentration (C max) and area under the  concentrati on-time curve (AUC) increased 
proportionately with the dose. Iclaprim is  excreted, mainly in the urine, as conjugated metabolites.  
In a single -dose ECG -study with 1.6 mg /kg and 3.2 mg/kg infused over 30 minutes,  iclaprim prolonged the 
QTc interval (QT inte rval corrected for heart rate) in a  dose-dependent manner. Maximal increases 
coincided with C max levels and were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_94120]. Dosing with 1.6 mg/kg was assessed as acceptable 
for clinical purposes,  whereas dosing at 3.2 mg/kg was associated with rel evant QTc prolongations 
(>60  msec ) and nonspecific T -wave alterations.  
In a second single -dose ECG study using doses of 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg iclaprim base  infused over 
30 minutes and 1.6 mg/kg infused over [ADDRESS_1001645] of iclaprim on  the duration of the QTc interval at 0.8 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg. 
Importantly, at both the  0.8-mg/kg and 1.6 -mg/kg doses, no subject had a maximal QTc value >500  msec . 
When  QTc was corrected according to Frid ericia (QTcF), no subject exhibited any postinfusion  QTcF 
prolongation of  >60 msec  from Baseline (BL). In addition, in both of the ECG  studies, no gender 
differences concerning QTc prolongations were observed, nor were  any cardiovascular adverse events 
(AEs) reported.  
A transient C max-related mean increase in QTc corrected according to Bazett (QTcB) of  approximately 
10 msec  was observed after infusion of 0.8 mg/kg iclaprim over 30 minutes.  This transient QTc 
prolongation is similar to or less than QTc prolongations observed with other antibiotics, eg, 51 msec  for 
IV erythromycin  [1], 3 to 11 msec  for clarithromycin  [2,3,4] ; moxi floxacin showed QTc prolongations of 9 
to 17  msec  in several  studies submitted in their N ew Drug Application  [5]. 
Iclaprim was sa fe and well tolerated; no treatment -related severe AEs were observed in  any of the subjects 
exposed to iclaprim in Phase [ADDRESS_1001646] doses tested, 
3.2 mg/kg as a single dose and multiple doses of  1.6 mg/kg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 10 days.  
5.3.3 Phase 2 cSSSI Study  
In a Phase 2 clinical study of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections ( cSSSI ), patients 
were randomized to receive  either iclaprim base at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg or 1.6 mg/kg in fused over 
30 minutes every  12 hours or vancomycin 1 g every 12  hours. Clinical cure rates in all groups were >90%  
at Day  [ADDRESS_1001647] of Cure (TOC) visit.  
Drug -related AE rates were 0%, 6%, and 1 0%, for the 0.8 mg/kg, 1.6 mg/kg, and  vancomycin 1 g 
regimens, respectively. Both doses of  iclaprim were well tolerated.  No treatment -related serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were observed. In 48 patients who  had ECGs performed during the study medication 
administration period, central  evaluation of these data revealed an increase in QTcB interval >60  msec  
immediately  following study medication infusion in 2 patients ( 1 patient in each of the iclaprim  1.6 mg/kg 
and vancomycin groups), but the corresponding QTcF increases were below  60 msec . No QTc interval 
recorded immediately following completion of the infusion  exceeded 480  msec . Furthermore, no 
treatment -emergent cardiac rhythm disturbances were  observed.

The CI presented in this table were calculated using SAS -generated 95% CI. The ASSIST -[ADDRESS_1001649] -2, in the combined data set, the incidence of 
possibly or probably treatment -related AEs was 22.6% for the iclaprim treatment group, compared to 
27.9% for the linezolid group.  No treatment -related SAEs were observed in ASSIST -1; [ADDRESS_1001650] -2 was considered to be possibly treatment related (elevated alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] in one 
iclaprim -treated patient) . In general, iclaprim was safe and well tolerated with a similar AE profile to the 
comparator drug linezolid . 
With respect to cardiac effects, results from the combined Phase 3 clinical studies indicated that the 
incidence of QTc prolongations of concern (QTcF >60  ms) in the iclaprim treatment arms were similar to 
those observed in the linezolid treatment arms (3 patients each). Adverse events  of QTc prolongation were 
reported infrequently (4 cases in the iclaprim arms and 2 cases in the linezolid arms) and no cases of QTc 
prolongation related cardiac effects classified as treatment related AE were observed in thes e studies. 
Iclaprim led to a mean increase of the QTc interval by [CONTACT_2902] 5 to 6  msec  greater than that observed with 
linezolid, which is considered clinically well tolerated.  
The analysis of liver enzyme level increases in cSSSI patients was complex, as in addition to study drug 
treatment a number of other conditions can contribute to such effects, such as general state of health, 
underlying inflammatory condition, HCV, HBV and HAV, lifestyle (ie , drug / alcohol abuse), besides the 
effects of treatment with the study drug. Overall, the increases in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST ) levels observed upon IV exposure using the therapeutic dose in the cSSSI population were similar to 
those observed with linezolid treatment and were considered not to be of major clinical significance, since 
they were asymptomatic and without significant concomitant increase in bilirubin: no Hy’s law cases were

observed.  
5.4 Rationale  
5.4.1 Rationale for the Current Study  
Iclaprim is a n antibiotic (DHFR ) designed to be effective against bacteria that have developed resistance to 
other antibiotics, including trimethoprim. Iclaprim exhibits potent activity against Gram -positive clinical 
isolates of many genera of staphylococci, including methicillin sensitive staphylococci , MRSA , and beta -
hemolytic streptococci (eg, Group A and B streptococci) . It is also effective against  vancomycin -
intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin -resistant Enterococci, and quinolone -resistant 
strains . 
In 2008, following a Phase [ADDRESS_1001651] to the FDA and the EMA  (European 
Medicines Agency ) for approval to market the compound. On the basis of submitted data, iclaprim was not 
approved and ceased to be developed.  Motif has reviewed all preclinical and clinical data, incl uding the US 
and European regulatory correspondence s. Compared to the previous ASSIST protocols, the current study 
(protocol ICL -23-ABSSSI1 ) will employ a different dosing strategy  (fixed iclaprim dose instead of weight -
based iclaprim ) and  will use a diffe rent comparator (vancomycin instead of linezolid) . This study will also 
be larger, recruiting 100 more patients, and will be conducted in more sites from a number of different 
countries. Protocol s ICL-23-ABSSSI1  and ICL -23-ABSSSI2  will also use a new early timepoint (ETP) to 
evaluated early response as a primary efficacy endpoint, as recommended by [CONTACT_94164][INVESTIGATOR_94121]  [6]. 
Liver function test elevations of uncertain significance were seen in the previous ASSIST protocols. There 
is a need  for additional clinical studies to further demonstrate iclaprim’s safety and efficacy. For this 
reason, t his Phase [ADDRESS_1001652] the major pathogens associated with ABS SSI. Therefore, adult patient s with signs 
and symptoms of wound infection  (caused by [CONTACT_94147] [eg, needle sticks or insect bites]) , cellulitis, 
or major cutaneous abscess with surrounding cel lulitis  are eligible for this study. Evaluation of patient s 
with the se major infection subtypes of AB SSSI will provide support for the use of iclaprim in the broader 
ABSSSI population.  
5.4.3 Rationale for Iclaprim dose regimen  
Therapy for ABSSSI is generally 5 t o 14 days. An iclaprim dose of 80 mg administered over 2 hours every 
12 hours ( q12h) is selected as the dosing regimen to be progressed in pi[INVESTIGATOR_94122]. The selected dose is designed to optimize the efficacy and safety pr ofiles of iclaprim based on 
the following considerations  
• When iclaprim was tested in standard rodent models of infectio n, good efficacy was observed. The 
primary PK/PD predictors for efficacy were determined to be (1 ) the ratio of the area under the curve 
(AUC) to the minimum in hibitory concentration (MIC), ie,  AUC/MIC, and (2) the time above the 
MIC, ie,  T > MIC, expressed as a p ercent of the dosing interval. Thus, optimization of these two 
parameters would be expected to maximize the efficacy of the drug.  
• A thorough QTc (TQTc) study indicated that there was an association between the maximum QTc 
value and the maximum plasma iclaprim concentration (C max). Thus, minimization of C max would be 
expected to correspond to optimal card iovascular safety of iclaprim . In the TQTc study, doses of 
1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg administered over 0.5 hours led to dose  related increases in the QTc, whereas 
Protocol Version (3 Dec 2015 ) Page 27 of 84  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Motif BioSciences  Clinical Protocol  Protocol /Amendment  No.: 
Iclaprim  ICL-23-ABSSSI1 -01 
 
0.5 mg/kg administered over 0.5 hours did not. The increases in QTc for the 1 mg/kg dose were 
considered to be mild, with a mean  (95% confidence interval) change in the placebo - and baseline -
corrected QTcB of 10.3 (3.3, 17.3) msec. This dose was associated with a geometric mean (95% 
confidence interval) C max of 792 (682, 919) ng/mL. A reference Cmax of 800  ng/mL was therefore 
used for the evaluation of potential dosing regimens with respect to the risk of QTc prolongation.  
• Iclaprim was administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg over 0.[ADDRESS_1001653] -2 
to 470 patients.  Iclaprim was well tolerated  in both studies at this dose. Adverse events related to QTc 
prolongation were reported infrequently (4  cases in the iclaprim arms and 2 cases in the linezolid arms) 
and no cases of QTc prolongation -related cardiac effects classified as treatment related AEs were 
observed in these studies. Iclaprim led to a mean increase of the QTc interval by [CONTACT_2902] 5 to 6 msec 
greater than that observed with linezolid, a drug that is considered to be clinically well tolerated.  
• A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of the data from the AS SIST studies demonstrated no 
relationship between the clearance (CL) of iclaprim and body weight, suggesting that a fixed rather 
than weight -based dose should be used.  
The ASSIST -[ADDRESS_1001654] -hoc 
estimates of the individual patient PK parameters were used to simulate the plasma iclaprim concentration -
time profiles for each patient and from those profiles, the corresponding values for Cmax ss, AUC(0 -24) ss, 
AUC/MIC, and T  > MIC. In these a nalyses, the MIC value used was based on the MIC 90 of S. aureus  of 
120 ng/mL identified in worldwide surveillance studies.  Various fixed dose regimens were examined with 
respect to maximizing AUC/MIC and T  > MIC while minimizing the probability of a steady -state C max 
(Cmax ss) ≥800 ng/mL.  The results of these simulations form the basis for the selection of the dose in 
proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].  
The data from the simulations of the fixed dose regimens (64  mg, 72 mg, and 80 mg) based on the post -hoc 
estimates of iclaprim PK in 470 patients indicate that administration of 80 mg as a 2 hou r infusion should 
provide a 28% increase in AUC/MIC and a 32% increase in the T > MIC compared to the dosing regimen used in the previous ASSIST trials, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_733116] 800  ng/mL from 
the TQTc study and lower than the observed mean values for Cmax at doses > 0.5 mg/kg in the TQTc studies. The refore, the  regimen of 80 mg administered over 2 h ours q12h  would be expected  to maximize 
the likelihood of antibacterial efficacy while minimizing the potential for QTc prolongation.  
An iclaprim dose of 40 mg administered over 2 hours every 12 hours ( q12h) is selected as the dosing 
regimen  for patients with moderate hepatic impair ment (Child -Pugh Class B  [Appendix E]). An open -label, 
parallel, single dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of iclaprim in subjects with hepatic or renal 
dysfunction and in obese subjects showed a 2.5 -fold increase in AUC and a 1.4 -fold increase  in C
max. Since 
iclaprim clearance was reduced by 50%, a 50% reduction in dose will be used  for patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment [ 7]. 
5.4.4 Rationale for choice of comparator  
In this study, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive fixed -dose iclaprim (group 1) or 
weight -based vancomycin  (group 2).  
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic and is active against many Gram -positive bacteria, including 
Staphylococcus aureus  [8]. It is indicated in potentially life -threatening infections, is used for therapy of 
severe staphylococcal infections, and remains as the recommended first -line empi[INVESTIGATOR_733117] 
(purulent and nonpurulent)  [8,9]. It is widely available, is cost -effective, and its safety has been well 
established over years of use [9]. 
Vancomycin  has been chosen as the comparator  in this double -blind study  because it is the standard of care 
Gram -positive treatment for ABSSSI according to Infectious Diseases Society o f America  guidelines, most 
commonly used empi[INVESTIGATOR_94125] -positive treatment for ABSSSI, it will help facilitate blinding ( compatible

infusion times ), and recent FDA -approved ABSSSI treatments used vancomycin as the treatment 
comparator during clinical trials.  
According  to the most recent recommendations for vancomycin dosing compi[INVESTIGATOR_94126], the American Society  of Health- System Pharmacists, and the Society  of Infectious 
Diseases Pharmacists , it is recommended that dose a djustments be based on monitored trough levels  to 
maintain the required therapeutic concentration levels  [10]. This is the most practical and accurate method 
of assessing vancomycin effectiveness  [10]. The recommended trough serum concentrations are either  10 
to 15 mg/L  for patients with an organism whose minimum inhibitory concentration  (MIC ) is ≤1 mg/L or 15  
to 20 mg/L for patients with an organism whose MIC is >1 mg/ L [11]. Normal saline dummy infusions will 
be used to maintain the blind.  
Vancomycin dosing will be capped at 1750 mg per dose ; in morbidly obese patients (above 100  kg of body 
weight ), there is little additional increase in creatinine clearance  at doses >1750 mg  [12,13,14,15] . 
6. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective : 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that iclaprim is non-inferior  to vancomycin in 
achieving a ≥20% reduction in lesion size at 48  to 72 hours (ETP) compared to baseline  in all randomized

from the size at baseline, no increase in lesion size since ETP, and no requirement for additional 
antibiotics [except aztreonam and metronidazole] or unplanned significant surgical procedures  
after ETP other than bedside wound care) at Test of Cure (TOC) visit (7 to14 days after the end of 
treatment);  
2. Resolution or near resolution  (≥90%)  of ABSSSI at End of Therapy (EOT);  
3. Resolution or near resolution ( ≥90%)  of ABSSSI  at EOT and TOC among patients with severe

planned, an additional evaluation visit will need to be performed on that day (ie. All EOT evaluations 
should be performed on the last day [+2 days ] of drug dose).  Patients will also be evaluated at the TOC 
visit ([ADDRESS_1001656] -EOT), and will have a Late Foll ow-Up (LFU) phone call ([ADDRESS_1001657] 
dose) Note, however, that p atients with high LFTs and unresolved AEs at TOC must be seen in person for 
an additional visit at LFU . The total duration of participation in the study for each patient  is 29 to 33  days.  
After completing screening procedures, including obtaining cultures from a clinical specimen prior to 
antibacterial therapy, a total of 600 patients (300 per treatment group) will be randomized (1:1) to receive 
either: (1) iclaprim 80 mg every 12 hours or (2) vancomycin 15 mg/kg . The duration of treatment for both 
groups will be 5 days (minimum duration) to 14 days  (maximum duration). Assignment to study treatment 
will be performed using a central randomization system.  Approximately  [ADDRESS_1001658] or his/her designee will be responsible for preparation of infusions. To account for the variable vancomycin dosing  intervals , normal saline dummy 
infusions will be used  to maintain  the blind for patients who require a vancomycin dosing frequency other 
than Q12h . 
Concomitant antibiotics aztreonam and metronidazole used in compliance with their respective prescribing 
information are allowed at the discretion of the investigator during the study treatment phase.  
Systemic antibiotics (other than aztreonam and metronidazole) or topi[INVESTIGATOR_733118], steroids >20 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent; and Typ e I A and

7.3.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Replacement Procedures  
Patients withdrawn from the study or prematurely discontinued from study medication  treatment will not be 
replaced.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from  study medication  and termination of study participation  
Reasons  for withdrawal of study drug : 
• Death  of patient ; 
• Patient withdraws consent to participate in the study; and  
• At the request of the investigator or the sponsor : 
o General or specific changes in the patient's condition that render him or  her unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator;  
o Patient noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the prescribed dosing 
and follow -up regimen. 
Termination of study par ticipation : 
Patients must be withdrawn from the study if they withdraw consent to participate. They  are not required to 
state their reasons for withdrawing consent.  
Patients must have study treatment discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
• Infection -related reasons:  
o Baseline bacteriological cultures of acceptable specimen(s) demonstrate  exclusively 
Gram -negative pathogens and/or fungi  (patients with no growth in their baseline cultures 
may continue if they are improving clinically ); 
o Worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of ABSSSI during study  medication treatment 
such that additional or alternative systemic  antibacterial therapy is warranted;  
o Treatment with a prohibited concomitant antibiotic (Section 7.4.4 .2); 
o Treatment with antibiotics other than those specified in the protocol;  
o Development of a confirmed concomitant infection that is not an ABSSSI such that 
additional or  alternative syste mic antibacterial treatment is warranted; and  
o Diagnosis of osteomyelitis made while  the patient is receiving study medication.  
o A baseline blood culture that is growing a Gram -negative organism.  
• Treatment -emergent cardiovascular abnormalities:  
o QTcF  values that both exceed an absolute  QTcF  value of 520 msec  and exceed the 
baseline  QTcF  value by >60  msec ;

Motif BioSciences  Clinical Protocol  Protocol /Amendment  No.: 
Iclaprim  ICL-23-ABSSSI1 -01 
 
o Ventricular arrhythmia; and  
o Requirement for Type  IA or III anti -arrhythmic drugs.  
• Treatment -emergent  LFT abnormalities  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].4 for expected evaluations) : 
o Patients who have con firmed AST or ALT elevations of > 5X ULN  should be 
discontinued from study medication and followed through LFU for safety ; and  
o Patients who have a bilirubin ≥ 2X ULN with an AST or ALT ≥ 3X ULN and with an 
alkaline phosphatase  (ALP)  < 2X ULN should be immediately discontinued from study 
medication and followed through LFU . 
• Treatment -emergent  acute kidney injury : 
o Patients who  have a confirmed increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of 0.5 mg/dL from 
baseline, if SCr was normal at baseline, or (2) a 50% increase in SCr from baseline, if the 
upper limit of SCr was not normal at baseline. This does not apply to patients on hemodialysi s, continuous renal replacement therapy (e.g., CVVH, CVVHD), or 
peritoneal dialysis  [12]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Patient s Prematurely Discontinued from the Study Treatment Regimen or 
Withdrawn from Study 
If a patient must be discontinued  from the study treatment prior to the EOT evaluation,  premature 
termination procedures should be performed at the time of withdrawal and appropriate standard of care 
therapy instituted. The reason for discontinuation, if known,  and the antibacterial thera py must be recorded 
on the case report form (CRF). All  patients will be requested to return for the TOC visit irrespective of  
whether randomized study treatment is completed.  
7.4 Treatment of Patients  
7.4.1 Treatments Administered  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigational product, dosage and  mode of administration  
Iclaprim will be administered at a dose of 80 mg in 500 mL normal saline, infused over 2 hours  q12h for 5 
to 14 days.  A window of +/ - [ADDRESS_1001664] not be administered  as a bolus injection, undiluted solution, intramuscular  injection, or 
subcutaneous injection.  
For subjects with moderate hepatic impairment  (Child -Pugh Class B  [Appendix E]), iclaprim will be 
administered at a dose of 40 mg in 500 mL normal saline, infuse d over 2 hours  q12h for 5 to 14 days.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reference therapy, dosage, and mode of administration  
Vancomycin will be dosed as follows: 15 mg/kg body weight  (to a maximum of 1750 mg; using actual 
body weight)  in 500 mL  normal saline infused over 2 hours for 5 to 14 days. Dosing interval will be every 
q12h, q24h, q48h, or based on daily levels  based on creatinine clearance.  Patients randomized to 
vancomycin who require dosing intervals of q24h, q48h, or dosed by [CONTACT_733131]  (normal saline) at 12 hour intervals when they are not to receive vancomycin.  
Patients who are on intermittent hemodialysis will be dosed after dialysis  based on their pre -hemodialysis  
level . Patients who are on continuous renal replac ement therapy  will be dosed q24h.

Vancomycin dosing will be adjusted based on trough levels to maintain a trough of either 10 to 15 mg/L for 
patients with an organism whose MIC is ≤1 mg/L or 15 to 20 mg/L for patients with an organism whose  
MIC is >1 mg/L. Trough levels should be drawn at Dose 5 for patients with normal renal function. For 
patients with renal impairment ( creatinine clearance  < 75 mL/min), the following table should be used for 
the in itial dosing interval :

Patients with a creatinine clearance ≥25 m L/min should have their vancomycin level checked with the 5th 
dose due to difficulty interpreting levels checked prior to achieving st eady state . 
For patients with a creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, a daily level should be obtained and the unblinded 
team should monitor and re -dose the patient when that level is below 20  mg/L .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Accountability, Reconciliation, and Return  
The sponsor  will provide each investigator with sufficient  amounts of the study  medication. The 
investigator will confirm receipt of all batches of study medication in  writing.  
The investigator  will administer the study medication only to patients enrolled in this  study and according 
to the procedures in this stu dy protocol. Each patient will be given  only the study medication carrying his 
or her randomization number. Each administration  of study medication will be documented in the  
electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
All supplies must be accounted for at the end of the study. The investigator ’s unblinded designee  must 
maintain accurate and adequate records, including dates; lot numbers; quantities received;  individual usage, 
etc. The investigator ’s designee  must also return all unused supplies to the sponsor  (or d esignee), noting the 
exact amount used in the study, regardless of whether the study  was completed or terminated prematurely. 
At the time of return, the investigator ’s unblinded designee  must  verify that all unused or partially used 
study medication suppli es have been returned and  that no remaining supplies are in the investigator's 
possession.  
7.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  and Measures to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Randomization /Patient Identification  
Once a signed and dated consent form and th e patient’s medical history have  been obtained, the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria have been met, appropriate information has been obtained  (including demographics, 
such as age and gender, as well as creatinine value) , a complete physical examination has  been completed  
(including weight) , the biological samples have been collected, and ECGs have been obtained, the patient 
will be assigned a  patient number and drug assignment  via a centralized randomization system (I XRS). 
Randomization will occur in a 1:1  ratio into 1 of the 2 treatment groups: fixed -dose iclaprim or 
weight -based vancomycin. The IXRS  will calculate the weight -based vancomycin dose  (including CrCL  
considerations) . 
As this is a double -blind study, all individuals except the unblinded pharmaci st (and delegated unblinded 
staff) at the study site must remain blinded to the  IV study therapy regimen. The unblinded pharmacist will 
access the IXRS  and will receive open -labeled clinical supplies from Motif  to prepare each dose of IV 
study therapy for each individual patient.  
 A single patient cannot be assigned more than 1 allocation number.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blinding  
This is a double -blind study (operating under in -house blinding procedures) in which the patient enrolled, 
the study investigator, study center personnel, and the sponsor  will be blinded to which clinical material is 
received until all patients have completed the study, the data have been screened for  completeness and 
accuracy, the database has been locked, and protocol violators have been identified. There will be an 
unblinded pharmacist (and delegated unblinded staff) at each study center who will prepare and account for 
the infusion bags of active study therapy according to guidelines provided in the pharmacy  manual . 
Vancomycin weight -based dosing levels, as well as  adjustments made during the study as a result of  trough 
monitoring, will only be known to the unblinded study team. The unblinded pharmacist and his/her 
delegated staff will not be involved in any management or evaluation of the safety and efficacy parameters

in the patient. All study personnel involved with patient eligibility and evaluation of safety and efficacy 
outcomes, including the study coordinator(s), investigator, or subinvestigator(s), must not have access to 
the treatment group assignment or the preparation of the infusion.  
Study blinding is employed to ensure the integrity of the data being collected. However, the safety of the 
patients participating in the study must not be compromised . If unblinding is urgent ly required to guide the 
immediate medical management of the patient, the investigator will be able to access the IXRS  to 
determine the patient’s treatment group assignment. The IXRS  unmasking feature is intended to be used 
only in situations in which emergency unblinding of the patient ( eg, knowledge of the exact treatment 
group required for treatment of a serious adverse experience) is deemed medically necessary. If any patient 
is unblinded prior to the completion of the study (either accidental unblinding or emergency unblinding for 
a serious adverse experience), the investigator must promptly contact [CONTACT_733133].  
Study medication accountability will be noted by [CONTACT_94174].  
7.4.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Any medication the patient takes other than study medications is considered a  concomitant medication. All 
concomitant medications (except parenteral or enteral  nutrition or IV solutions solely for the purpose of 
hydration or keepi[INVESTIGATOR_94129],  and all nondrug therapy [surgeries, debridements, etc.]) must be 
recorded in the  eCRF . The follo wing information must be recorded in the  eCRF  for each concomitant  
medication: trade  name, route of administration, dates of administration, dosage, and  indication.  
At baseline , patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the  previous [ADDRESS_1001667] dose to TOC, patients will be asked what  concomitant medications they are currently taking or changes 
since their previous study  visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Permitted  
Aztreonam and metronidazole are allowed concomitant antibiotics  at the discretion  of the investigator. No 
synergism or  antagonism has been observed with these antibio tics and iclaprim or vancomycin.  They  must 
be used in compliance with their respective package insert . For patients in whom Gram staining  of 
culturable material or culture s indicates that Gram -negative coverage is required, and  for patients in whom 
anaerobic pathogens are suspected or confirmed as pathogens at the  infected site, aztreonam and 
metronidazole may be administered, respectively. Treatment  with these agents shoul d be continued for at 
least [ADDRESS_1001668] 
anaerobic bacteria without cross -coverage of aerobic Gram -positive pathogens.  The investigator has the 
discretion to determine if IV or p.o. metronidazole is  administered. Please refer to the country -specific 
package insert for recommendations about  metronidazole dosing.  
No other systemic antibiotics or topi[INVESTIGATOR_733119].  
In the event of suspected Clostridium dificile colitis, vancomycin may be administered orally .

specimens , or punch biopsies  of an area contiguous to the infected wound should be obtained. Swabs are not acceptable; cult ures will be performed locally, where isolates  will be retained for transport 
to a central microbiology laboratory for susceptibility testing according to CLSI -approved methodology . Note that only target pathogens will be sent to the central microbiology l aboratory (therefore, 
contaminants/Gram -negative isolates [from mixed wound infections] in blood cultures do not need to be sent). If the patient is discontinued from the study due to treatment failure, a clinical specimen 
will be obtained at that time onl y. Additional clinical specimens will be obtained, if clinically feasible and if the patient has persistent clinical signs or symptoms, at ETP, EOT, and TOC.  
20 For vancomycin patients with a creatinine clearance < 25mL/min, a daily level should be obtaine d and the unblinded team should monitor and re -dose the patient when that level is below 20 mg/L.  
21 Vancomycin p atients with a creatinine clearance ≥25 mL/min should have their vancomycin level checked with the 5th dose due to difficulty interpreting levels checked prior to achieving steady state.

The following procedures will be performed during the  baseline  visit, within 24 hours of study  entry  (first 
dose of study drug): 
• Obtain informed consent;  
• Record medical history  (pre-existing conditions) ; 
• Prior medications (within the preceding 30 days)  
• Verify inclusion and exclusion criteria ; 
• Perform complete physical examination , including vital signs (includes determination of body 
temperature ), height, weight, and a re view by [CONTACT_94176] ; 
• Assess clinical signs and symptoms of ABSSSI ; including photography (procedure outlined in 
Appendix B). Acetate based planimetric tracing will follow the procedures outlined in 
Appendix  C. (Planimetry measurements are based upon autom atic detection of pi[INVESTIGATOR_94134].  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_94135]

peripheral sites ;  
• Perform and assess 12-lead ECG ([ADDRESS_1001683] 1 minute apart);  
• Obtain sample for culture from infection site . Deep culture samples, such as from a biopsy, needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], surgically obtained specimens , or punch biopsies  of an area contiguous to the infected 
wound should be obtained. Swabs are not acceptable; cultures will be performed local ly, where 
isolates will be retained for transport to a central microbiology laboratory for susceptibility testing 
according to CLSI -approved methodology ;

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of randomized patients who achieve an early clinical 
response (defined as reduction in the lesion size ≥20% compared to baseline) at 48 to 72 hours (ETP)  as 
measured by [CONTACT_94179]  (See Appendix C). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
The secondary endpoints are resolution or near resolution of ABSSSI ( ie, clinical cure) at TOC for iclaprim 
compared with vancomycin, resolution or near resolution (≥90%)  of AB SSSI at EOT, resolution or near 
resolution (≥90%)  of ABS SSI at EOT  and TOC among patients with severe infection at baseline , time to 
resolution of signs and symptoms of ABSSSI, by -patient bacteriological response rate  at EOT and TOC , 
and by -pathogen bacteriological response rate  at EOT and TOC . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Clinical Assessment  
The primary endpoint for clinical response (defined as the reduction in lesion size ≥20% compared to 
baseline) will be evaluated in all randomized patients at ETP ([ADDRESS_1001696] dose ). Patients who 
have died or who received rescue antibacterial therapy prior to that time will be included as treatment 
failures. In addition, clinical outcome will be evaluated by [CONTACT_94144] ([ADDRESS_1001697]-EOT). The assessments of clinical outcome will be categorized as cure , failure,  or indeterminate  
defined as follows:  
• Cure: defined by a ≥90% reduction in lesion size from baseline, no increase in lesion size since 
ETP, and no requirement for additional antibiotics (except aztreonam and metronidazole ) or 
unplanned significant surgical procedures;  
Protocol Version (3 Dec 2015 ) Page 51 of 84  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Motif BioSciences  Clinical Protocol  Protocol /Amendment  No.: 
Iclaprim  ICL-23-ABSSSI1 -01 
 
• Failure: reduction in lesion size that is <20% for ETP and <90% for EOT and TOC compared to 
baseline, death related to the infection, persisting or recurrent infection, need for unplanned 
surgical procedure, or administration of rescue antibiotic therapy for the index infection or 
recurrence of index infection; or  
• Indeterminate: data inadequate for assessment of efficacy  (there are no post-baseline  local or 
systemic signs and symptoms data available to make th is assessment [eg, patient lost to follow up ] 
after <2  days of treatment or <4 doses and no EOT evaluation ), lost to follow -up prior to ETP, 
withdrawal of consent , receipt of effective antibiotic therapy for a cause other than the index 
infection, or death  not attributed to the index ABSSSI or complication of ABSSSI.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Infection  
Eight signs (tenderness to palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], erythema, edema, purulent drainage/discharge,  fluctuance, 
induration, ulceration, and necrotic tissue) and 4  symptoms (localized pain,  swelling, chills, and fever) of 
infection will be assessed at each evaluation and graded on  a scale of 0 to 3 ( 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 
or 3=severe).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Microbiology Assessment  
An adequate clinical specimen for microbiologic eval uation ( eg, pus from a wound or abscess, an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_733120]) will be obtained at baseline prior to 
randomization. Additional clinical specimens will be obtained, if clinically feasible and if the patient has 
persistent clinical signs or symptoms, at ETP, EOT , and TOC. If the patient is discontinued from the study 
due to treatment failure, a clinical specimen will be obtained at that time . Specimens will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_94145]; in addition, isolates will be subcultured and sent to a central 
microbiology laboratory for confirmation of pathogen  identity and MIC s 
Two sets of blood samples for aerobic/anaerobic cultures [ADDRESS_1001698] be withdrawn from study 
medication and started on the appropriate antibiotics for com plicated bacteremia. If patient has signs of 
bacteremia  at any Visit , 2 sets of aerobic/anaerobic blood cultures that are collected at different sites should 
be obtained [ADDRESS_1001699] be withdrawn from study medication and started on the appropriate 
antibiotics for complicated bacteremia. If patient has a blood culture that g rows a Gram -positive pathogen 
from Visit 1 and/or Visit [ADDRESS_1001700] be withdrawn from study medication and started on the 
appropriate antibiotics for complicated bacteremia.  Blood cultures from intravascular devi ces are not 
permitted. Any potential pathogen will be subcultured and the isolates shipped to the central laboratory.  
The data generated by [CONTACT_733135].  Anti-streptolysin O titers 
will also be taken within 24 hours of the start of treatment.  
Microbiological response will be assessed at the patient  level and at the microbiological level on the basis 
of results of the cultures, the  susceptibilities of identified organisms, and the clinical outcome of the patient. 
In patients with a Gram -positive pathogen isolated at baseline , microbiological response by [CONTACT_733136], EOT , and TOC visits and categorized as eradication, presumed eradication (no material 
available for culture in clinically cured patients), persistence, presumed persistence (no material available 
for culture in patients who had clinical failure), indeterminate (those patients with clinical outcome of  
indeterminate) , superinfection ( ie, the emergence of a new isolate documented at the site of infection with 
worsening signs and symptoms of infection –identified after completion of therapy), or  recurrent infection 
(pathogen that is different from  baseline  pathogen[s] is isolated).  
The protocol for shipment of isolates from the local laboratory to the central laboratory , and details of the 
environmental conditions under which specimens and isolates will be stored , can be found in the

Laboratory Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.1  By-Pathogen Bacteriological Response  
For each assessment (ETP, EOT, and TOC), t he by- pathogen bacteriological response for each causative 
organism identified at  baseline  will be defined as follows:  
• Eradication:  baseline  causative organism cannot be isolated fr om any culture(s) at  the assessment.  
• Presumed eradication: The patient is a clinical cure at the assessment, and there is  no appropriate 
material for culture from the original site of infection.  
• Persistence: The  baseline  causative pathogen (based on susceptibility profile or  molecular typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) 
is isolated at the assessment.  
• Presumed persistence: The patient is a clinical failure at the assessment, and no  appropriate 
material is available for culture from the original site  of ABSSSI.  
• Indeterminate: Clinical response was Indeterminate at the assessment and no appropriate material 
is available for culture from the original  site of ABSSSI.  
• Superinfection : A pathogen is isolated at the assessment  that is different from the  baseline  
causative pathogen.  
• Recurrent infection: A pathogen is isolated only after the EOT visit that is different  from the  
baseline  pathogen(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.2  By-Patient Bacteriological Response  
The by -patient bacteriological response will be determined according to the following  definitions:  
• Eradication: All baseline  Gram -positive causative organism(s) have a response of  Eradication . 
• Presumed eradication: All  baseline  Gram -positive causative organism(s) have a response of 
Presumed Eradication or a combination of responses of  Eradication and Presumed Eradication.  
• Persistence: All or some  baseline  Gram -positive causative organism(s) have a response of 
Persistence or a co mbination of responses of  Persistence and Presumed Persistence . 
• Presumed persistence: All or some  baseline  Gram -positive causative organism(s) have a  response 
of Presumed Persistence . 
• Indeterminate: All baseline  causative organism(s) have a response of Ind eterminate . 
• Superinfection: Any patient classified as a clinical failure who has a pathogen  isolated during 
therapy that is different from the  baseline  causative  pathogen . 
• Recurrent infection: Any patient classified as a clinical failure who has a pathogen  isolated after 
the EOT visit only, that is different from the  baseline  pathogen(s) . 
7.6.2 Safety Assessments  
All patient s who receive any study drug will be evaluated for safety on the basis of medical history and 
physical examinations, reports of clinical AEs, routine electrocardiography, and clinically significant

findings from routine liver function tests,  serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and UA tests. All 
adverse events will be recorded throughout the study period, up to and including the LFU phone  call. While 
blinded to treatment assignment, the investigator will categorize the severity of each AE and the potential 
for relationship to study drug. Serious AEs include  those that were life threatening, led to prolongation of 
the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a congenital a nomaly/birth defect,  or caused persistent or significant disability, 
incapacity, or death. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be defined as those that start  or worsen in 
severity during or after the first dose of study drug administratio n through end of study . 
The guidance for grading the severity of adverse events can be found in Appendix G. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Definitions  
The term "adverse event," as used by [CONTACT_456] , is synonymous with the term "adverse experience," 
which is used by [CONTACT_1622] . 
An AE is any untoward, undesired, unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or 
laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a human being participating in a clinical study with a 
sponsor  test article, regardless of cau sal relationship.  This includes the following:  
• Any clinically significant worsening of a pre -existing condition.  
• Note: Emergence of a new pathogen associated with a clinical event during therapy at a site 
other than the initial site of infection will be co nsidered to be an AE.  
• Any recurrence of a pre -existing condition.  
• An AE occurring from overdose of a sponsor  study drug whether accidental or intentional ( ie, a 
dose higher than that prescribed by a health care professional for clinical reasons).  
• An AE occurring from abuse of a sponsor  study drug ( ie, use for nonclinical reasons).  
• An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a sponsor  study drug.  
 
A procedure is not an AE , but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
A pre-existing condition  is a clinical condition (including a condition being treated) that is diagnosed 
before the patient signs the ICF.  Pre-existing conditions will be recorded on the Medical  History/Current 
Medical Conditions page of the  eCRF . 
The questions concerning whether the condition existed before the start of the active phase of the study and 
whether it has increased in severity and/or frequency will be used to determine whether an event is a 
TEAE.  An AE is considered to be treatment emergent if (1) i t is not present when the active phase of the 
study begins and is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, or (2) it is present at 
the start of the active phase of the study or as part of the patient’s medical history, but the  severity or 
frequency increases during the active phase.  The active phase of the study begins at the time of the first 
dose of the study drug.  The active phase of the study ends at the last follow -up visit.  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical  signs or symptoms or 
require therapy, and are recorded on the AE page of the  eCRF  under  the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis 
associated with them.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1001701] be documented. Volunteered, observed, and elicited AEs 
will be recorded in the eCRF. This includes AEs the patient reports  spontaneously, those the investigator 
observes, and those the patient reports in response  to open -ended questions.

Each AE must be assessed and recorded in the eCRF as serious or not serious. S erious AEs must  be 
reported as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. I nternational Conference on Harmonisation  Guidelines and the 
Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR; 21  CFR 312.32, revised as of 01 April  2014) define an  SAE as any  
adverse drug experience occurring at any  dose that results in any of the following  outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life-threatening adverse event;

• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94137];  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions ; or 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize  the patient and 
may require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed in the above definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not  result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Events not considered to be SAEs are:  
1. Clinical failure, which is the primary study endpoint/variable;  
2. Routine treatment or monit oring of the studied indication not associated with any  deterioration in 
condition;  
3. Elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen; and  
4. Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the  definitions of 
serious given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Review of Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator and the sponsor  (or designee) will review each SAE report and evaluate  the relationship of 
the SAE to  study treatment. Based on the investigator 's and sponsor 's assessment of the SAE, a decision 
will be made concerning the need for further action.  The primary consideration governing further action is 
whether new findings affect the  safety of patients part icipating in the clinical study. If the discovery of a 
new SAE related  to the study medication raises concern over the safety of continued administration of the  
study medication to patients, the sponsor  will take immediate steps to notify the US FDA/other regulatory 
authorities and all investigator s participating in clinical studies of the study medication.  
Further action that may be required includes the following:  
• Modification of the protocol;  
• Discontinuation or suspension of  the study;  
• Modification of th e existing consent form and informing current study  participants of new 
findings;  
• Addition of any newly identified study medication -related AEs to the list of  expected AEs.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Protocol Deviations due to an Emergency or Adverse Event  
Departures from the protocol may occur  in the event of an emergency. In such cases, t he investigator or 
other physician in attendance must contact [CONTACT_94190]. All protocol deviations and the reasons for  such deviations must be 
reported accordingly . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Laboratory Determinations  
Investigative sites will use local laboratory results to confirm patient eligibility  (inclusion/exclusion 
criteria). A central laboratory will receive samples for al l safety  laboratory evaluations as described in 
Table 3. 
Procedures for the collection, preparation, and transportation of samples to the central  laboratory for 
evalua tion are detailed in the Laboratory M anual . 
Although the results of  these analyses will be provided to the respective investigators on  a regular basis, 
investigators should use their local laboratories to generate data necessary  for the routine management of 
the patient's medical conditions, since central laboratory  results will not be available in a timely manner for 
patient management.  
Clinical hematology and chemistry tests and UA will be performed on certain study  days as shown in the 
Schedule of Study  Procedures ( Table 3). In addition, a  serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed 
immediately prior to randomization  for female patients  of childbearing potential . (Patients who are 
pregnant will be excluded or withdrawn from  the study.  Patients who become pregnant during the study 
must inform the investigator and be withdrawn from study medication. ) 
Clinical hematology tests will include hematocrit, hemoglobin, re d blood cell (RBC)  count, WBC count, 
platelet count, and WBC differential including neutrophils,  lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils, MCH, MCHC, MCV , and CRP.  
Clinical chemistry tests will include creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),  AST, AL T, ALP , gamma 
glutamyl transferase , lactate dehydrogenase , creatine phosphokinase , total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, 
glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate.  
Urinalysis will include determination of pH, specific gravity, presence  of blood, glucose,  protein, ketones, 
and bile, and microscopic examination of sediment.

study medication dose. In  addition , a 12-lead ECG will be performed at ETP  within 10 minutes after the 
end of  infusion, as specified in the  Schedule of Study Procedures  (Table 3). 
If the median QTcF  value is >500  msec  and/or is >60 msec  different from the predose  baseline  value, 
follow -up ECG tests should  be performed every 1 to 2 hours until they are below these threshold  values.  
Fredericia’s formula is as follows:  
QTcF = QT / RR1/[ADDRESS_1001710]  1 minute apart and the median QTcF  value will be 
evaluated at  the respective study site for exclusion criterion 1 5 (Section  7.3.2 ), for compliance with study 
protocol -defined procedures (see above) and safety.  
Furthermore, all ECG tests will also be transmitted to, and electronically stored at , a central center 
speciali zed in the standardized evaluation of ECG tests. Procedures for performing  ECG tests and 
subsequent transmission to and interpretation by [CONTACT_94192] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Liver Function Tests  
Liver function tests will be taken at screening, and patients with s evere hepatic disease (Child -Pugh 
Class C) or known AST or ALT  >5 times the upper limit of normal and/or bilirubin >[ADDRESS_1001711] ion tests will 
also be taken at V2 visits, ETP, EOT, and TOC. Patients with high liver function tests at TOC will be 
required to come in for an additional visit at LFU. Blood samples will be obtained to document 
normalization.  
For patients who meet 1 of the 2 LFT discontinuation criteria  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , an appropriate evaluation of 
causes for the liver enzyme abnormalities should be initiated and the LFTs should be followed every 48 -72 
hours until normalization or stability.  The following evaluations should be considered:  
• History , including alcohol and other drugs of abuse ; 
• Clinical symptoms – RUQ pain, nausea etc .; 
• Viral hepatitis serologies ; 
• Autoimmune hep atitis serologies ; 
• Concomitant medication review to eliminate possible heptatotoxic medications where possible ; 
• Ethanol and acetaminophen/paracetamol levels ; and  
• Abdominal ultrasound . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Safety Information  
The investigator  must promptly report to his or her IRB/IEC/ REB all  unanticipated problems involving 
risks to patients. This includes death from any cause  and all SAEs associated, or possibly associated, with 
the use of the study medication.

7.7 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from patients on 3 occasions : following the first dose of study 
medication, at ETP , and at EOT. After the study is complete, the database locked , and the data unblinded, 
patients randomized to iclaprim will have the ir samples assayed . 
7.7.1 Collection and Handling of Samples  
Pharmacokinetic blood samples (5 mL) for determination of iclaprim concentrations will  be collected on 
Day 1, ETP and EOT  at the following timepoints: before  study medication infusion, and within 5 to 15 
minutes, 1 to 3 hours, and 5 to 7 hours after  the end of study medication infusion (see Table 3). Per patient, 
a total of 12 samples, for a  total of 60 mL blood, w ill be obtained for PK analysis. All samples will be 
labeled to  indicate the clinical study number, patient number, actual relative time after study  medication 
administration, and sampling number. Processing,  storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_733121] . Plasma concentrations of  iclaprim will be measured by a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass  spectrometric detection assay  [16].

7.8.1 Data Quality Assurance  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit , or at an investigator's meeting, a sponsor  representative will 
review the protocol and CRFs with the investigators and their staff. During the study, the CRA  will visit the 
site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries in the CRFs, the 
adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and also to ensure that study medication 
is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel should be 
availab le to assist the monitor during these visits.  
Subsequently, information entered into the database is systematically checked by [CONTACT_94193], 
using error messages printed from validation programs and database listings. Obvious errors, eg, simple 
spelling errors, will be corrected by [CONTACT_94194]. Other errors or omissions will be entered 
on Data Query Forms, which will be returned to the investigational site for resolution. A copy of the  signed 
Data Query Form is to be kept with the CRF s, and, once the original is received at the sponsor  (or 
designee), the resolutions will be entered into the database. Quality control audits of all key safety and efficacy data in the database will be made after entering data from each visit.  
When the dat abase has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked and 
unblinded. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_733138], the Study Statistician, and the Data Ma nager.  
Further details are defined in the separate guidelines for data entry and data management personnel.  
7.8.[ADDRESS_1001713] complete the CRFs and transmit the data as instructed by [CONTACT_456]  (or designee) 
and must store a copy of the source documents with other study documents, eg, the protocol, the 
investigators' brochure, and any protocol amendments, in a secure place. All entries to the CRFs must be 
made as described in the CRF Completion Guideline or as instructed by [CONTACT_456]  (or designee) at study 
initiation.  
Patient data collected within the eCRFs during th e study will be documented in an anonymous fashion and 
the patient will only be identified by [CONTACT_92361], and by [CONTACT_5657]/her birth date if also required. If, as an

procedures by  [CONTACT_12142]. Essential documents include:  
1. IRB/IEC/REB approvals for the study protocol and all amendments; 
2. All source documents and laboratory records;  
3. eCRF copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
4. Patients' ICFs (with study number and title of study);  
5. FDA Form 1572 (as required); and  
6. Any other pertinent study document.  
7.9 Statistical Methods  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients who achieve an early clinical response 
(defined as  reduction in the lesion size ≥ 20% compared to baseline) at 48 to 72 hours (ETP) and will be 
evaluated among all randomized patients (ITT population).  
In general, statistical tests will be two- sided, and at the level of significance alp ha = 0.05. The NI 
assessment will be made with a one -sided test at significance level of 0.025. Confidence intervals will be 
calculated at a 95% confidence level.  
Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_733140] ( N), mean, standard deviation  (SD), median and range and categorical data will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_22136] N and percentage.

7.9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Using Farrington and Manning’s method for non -inferiority (NI) testing wi th a 1 sided alpha of 0.025, 
assuming a 75% early clinical response rate in each group and a 10% non -inferiority bound delta, a sample 
size of 295 ITT patients per treatment group is required for 80% power. In addition, using similar methods 
of NI testing with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, assuming a 90% early clinical response rate at TOC in each 
group and a 10% NI bound delta, a sample size of 300 patients in the ITT population per treatment group  is 
required for 82% power. If the initial endpoint of clinical  response at ETP does not achieve statistical 
significance, no further statistical testing will be done.  
A total of 600 patients will be randomized (approximately 300 per treatment group  will be randomized ). 
7.9.2 Patient Populations Analyzed  
Intent -to-treat (ITT) population — All randomized patients (primary population for efficacy analyses).  
Patients will be analyzed in treatment group to which they were randomized.  
 Microbiological intent -to-treat ( mITT ) population — All randomized patients who have a Gram -positive  
baseline bacterial pathogen identified as the cause of ABSSSI.  
 
Modified clinically evaluable (mCE) population  consists of all patients excluded from the PP population 
only because they have received prohibited concomitant or preceding antibiotic therapy active against 
Gram -positive pathogens.  
 
PP population — ITT patients who receive at least 80% of their planned doses and provide adequate data 
for assessment for each of the following timepoints: ETP, EOT , and TOC . This excludes pa tients with 
Gram -negative bloodstream infections who were discontinued in order to treat the Gram -negative  
pathogen . 
 
PP microbiologically evaluable population ( mPP ) — mITT  patients who receive at least 80% of their 
planned doses and provide adequate data for assessment for each of the following timepoints: ETP, EOT , 
and TOC . 
 Safety population — All patients who receive any study drug during the trial (primary population for safety 
analyses).  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they received.  
7.9.3 Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Outcome Measures 
The primary efficacy endpoint  is the pro portion of  randomized  patients who achieve an early clinical 
response (defined as  reduction in the lesion size ≥ 20% compared to baseline) at 48 to 72 hours (ETP) and 
will be evaluated among all randomized patients (ITT population).  The primary efficacy analysis will be 
the NI of iclaprim (group  1) to vancomycin (group  2) for the proportion of patients with a ≥ 20% reduction 
in lesion size at ETP compared to baseline.  Let P1 be the proportion for iclaprim and P2 be the proportion 
for vancomycin. Equivalently, if the lower bound of the two -sided 95% CI for P1 – P2 is greater than -
0.[ADDRESS_1001717] with unpooled variance estimate, NI will be concluded.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The primary NI efficacy analysis will be  repeated in the mITT , mCE,  the Per Protocol, and the mPP  
populations  as secondary outcome s.

The secondary endpoints are : 
1. Resolution or near resolution of ABSSSI ( ie, clinical cure, defined by a >90% reduction in lesion 
size from the size at baseline, no increase in lesion size since ETP, and no requirement for 
additional antibiotics [except aztreonam and metronidazole] or unplanned significant surgical 
procedures  after ETP other than bedside wound care ) at TOC for iclaprim ( 80 mg q12h) compar ed 
with vancomycin ( weight -based dose ) for ITT, mITT , mCE, PP, and mPP  populations  
2. Resolution or near resolution (≥90%)  of ABSS SI at EOT  for ITT, mITT , mCE,  PP, and mPP  
populations  
3. Resolution or near resolution (≥90%)  of ABS SSI at EOT  and TOC among patients with severe 
infection at baseline for ITT, mITT,  mCE,  PP, and mPP populations  
4. Time to resolution of signs and symptoms of ABSSSI  from start of treatment for ITT, mITT , 
mCE,  PP, and mPP  populations

Summary tables will be provided for all AEs by [CONTACT_1570].  The incidence of AEs, related AEs, SAEs, 
and AEs leading to discontinuation of the study treatment  will be presented by [CONTACT_94198] (SOC) and preferred term.  In addition, the incidence of AEs by 
[CONTACT_94153].   
The AE summary tables will include counts of patient s. Therefore, if a patient experiences more than one 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a particular AE, the patient will be counted only once for that event.  If a patient has more than 
one AE that is coded to the same preferred term, the patient will be counted only once for that preferred 
term.  Similarly, if a patient has more than one AE within a SOC, the patient will be counted only once in 
that SOC.  
Laboratory test variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_72082] (number of patients, mean , SD, minimum, maximum, as well as mean change from baseline, SD for mean 
and standard error for mean change, minimum, median, maximum, and number and percent of patients 
within specified categories).  Shift tables ( ie, cross -tabulations of below the lower limit of the normal range, 
within the limits of the normal range and above the upper limit of the normal range at baseline versus 
scheduled visits) will be presented by [CONTACT_94155]. Laboratory tests with categorical  results that cannot 
be analyzed by c hange from baseline or shift table analysis will not be included in these summaries, but 
will be listed.  Data obtained from laboratory tests not required by [CONTACT_94157], but 
will be listed.  
Descriptive statistics of vital signs and  ECG results at each visit will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
Physical examination findings will be listed for each patient.

7.9.5 Population Pharmacokinetic s 
Iclaprim plasma concentrations will be used to determine population PK parameters, including C max, AUC 
to infinity (AUC 0-∞), clearance, and volume of distribution . Interindividual variability (IIV) will be 
determined for PK parameters , as well as  residual variability. The potential influence of clinical  
characteristics (age, size, sex, hepatic function,  renal function, concomitant medications,  etc.) on PK 
parameters will be evaluated.  Further details will be detailed in a separate population PK analysis plan.  
7.9.6 Interim Analysis  
When 75% of the randomized patients have undergone the 48- to 72 -hour (ETP)  response assessment, the 
sponsor  will do a blinded interim analysis to estimate the percentage of patients in the study who classify as 
having a reduction in the lesion size ≥20% compared to baseline at the 48 - to 72-hour visit. Based on the 
observed overall percentage, the sponsor  may increase the total sample size to  attempt to ensure that an 
adequate number of ITT patients are included in the study. Since the review is blinded and the efficacy 
analyses will not be reviewed by [CONTACT_1570], no adjustment of p -values is required. Nevertheless, the 
sponsor  will take steps to minimize the distribution of results to avoid introducing any bias.

compared with vancomycin. The two iclaprim (0.8 and 1.6 mg base per kg  body weight) and vancomycin 
study arms were associated with high clinical cure and  bacteriological response rates . 
Both doses of iclaprim were well tolerated; however, AEs and shifts from normal  baseline  in laboratory 
parameters were recorded somewhat more frequently in the iclaprim  1.6 mg/kg group.  
Phase [ADDRESS_1001720] indicated that  doses up to 1.6 mg/kg 
b.i.d. are considered safe for clinical use.  
Iclaprim has the potential to be a new antibacterial agent active against Gram -positive  drug- resistant  
strains, with a good safety profile, and therefore should be furth er studied in larger patient  populations.

1. Tracings of ABSSSI site are conducted at:  baseline, ETP, EOT, and TOC.  
2. All required patient demographic information is to be recorded on tracing film header.  Both films 
are to be peeled away from the cardboard backer and placed face -up over the patient’s infection 
site. Tracing of the infection s ite is to be accomplished with the supplied Itoya tracing pen using a 
continuous stroke.  
3. The traced edge must be dark and continuous with no broken ink line.  
4. The following ABSSSI demarcations are made: 
a. Erythema (red pen)  
b. Induration (green pen)  
c. Wound (black  pen), if necessary  
5. The top film is to be peeled from the bottom film and placed back onto the cardboard backer.  The 
bottom film that came into contact [CONTACT_733143].  
6. The top film containing the actual tracing and header information is to be attached to the “waxy” side of the cardboard backer.   
7. The tracing is scanned on a supplied flatbed scanner and the scan uploaded to Canfield’s secure 
website for instant image analy sis.  
8. The Canfield planimetry application automatically detects the outlines of each of the colored 
demarcations contained on the tracing, and measures each demarcation for area (cm

the

described

Although
 
many

However,
 
failure
 
to

the

The

of
 
this

is
 
to
 
specify
 
the
 
emulation
 
of
 
the
 
SURPASS

trial
 
(

Tirzepatide
 
became
 
available
 
on
 
May
 
13,
 
2022,
 
when
 
it
 
was

to
 
treat

or

On
 
December

2024,
 
tirzepatide
 
was
 
approved
 
to
 
treat
 
moderate

(OSA)
 
in
 
adults
 
with

to
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
combination
 
with
 
a

diet
 
and

Finally,
 
on
 
November

2022,
 
dulaglutide
 
was
 
approved
 
for
 
use
 
in

10

The

examines

below
 
1.05
 
also
 
indicating
 
superiority
 
of

An
 
upper

of
 
the
 
95%

HR
 
of
 
≥1.05
 
but
 
<1.23
 
for
 
tirzepatide

will
 
indicate
 
noninferiority
 
and
 
proven
 
safety
 
of
 
tirzepatide
 
to
 
putative

If
 
the
 
upper
 
95%

a

Rationale
 
for
 
study
 
design
 
choice:
 
The
 
new
 
user
 
active-comparator
 
design
 
is
 
a
 
powerful
 
design
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
address
 
confounding
 
by
 
[CONTACT_35151].
 
It
 
accomplishes
 
this,
 
in
 
large
 
part,
 
through
 
judicious
 
selection
 
of
 
an
 
appropriate
 
active-comparator
 
group.
7,8
 
While
 
selection
 
of
 
an
 
appropriate
 
comparator
 
in
 
the
 
design
 
phase
 
is
 
crucial,
 
cohort
 
studies
 
often
 
require
 
additional
 
adjustment
 
of
 
measurable
 
confounders.
 
A
 
common
 
method
 
for
 
adjusting
 
for
 
confounding
 
is
 
via
 
a
 
propensity
 
score.

Context
 
and
 
rationale
 
for
 
outcome(s)
 
of
 
interest
 
The
 
primary
 
outcome
 
for
 
the
 
database
 
study
 
was
 
deﬁned
 
to
 
emulate
 
the
 
primary
 
outcome
 
of
 
the
 
trial,
 
i.e.,
 
MACE
 
(composite
 
of
 
cardiovascular
 
death,
 
myocardial
 
infarction,
 
or
 
stroke).
 
Due
 
to
 
the
 
inability
 
to
 
capture
 
cause
 
of
 
death
 
in
 
our
 
emulation,
 
we
 
modiﬁed
 
the
 
MACE
 
outcome
 
to
 
capture
 
all-cause
 
mortality,
 
myocardial
 
infarction,
 
or
 
stroke.
 
See
 
appendix
 
tables
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
for
 
operational
 
deﬁnitions
 
and
 
detailed
 
code
 
algorithms.
 
Optum

death
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
inpatient
 
discharged
 
dead
 
status,
 
social
 
security
 
death
 
master
 
ﬁle,
 
and
 
deaths
 
scraped
 
from
 
obituaries
 
or
 
other
 
sources.
 
MarketScan
 
includes
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
inpatient
 
discharged
 
dead
 
status
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
social
 
security
 
death
 
master
 
ﬁle.
 
PPV
 
for
 
myocardial
 
infarction
 
11
 
 
using
 
ICD9
 
codes
 
was
 
94%.
 
9–11
 
PPV
 
for
 
ischemic
 
stroke
 
using
 
ICD9
 
codes
 
was
 
95%.
 
Both
 
of
 
the
 
above
 
ICD9
 
codes
 
were
 
mapped
 
to
 
ICD10,
 
but
 
no

was
 
performed.
12
 
 
 
Secondary
 
outcomes
 
from
 
the
 
trial
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
evaluated
 
include:
 
1.
 
Individual
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
primary
 
endpoint,
 
i.e.,
 
all-cause
 
mortality,
 
myocardial
 
infarction,
 
and
 
stroke
.
 
Control
 
outcomes
 
of
 
interest
 
include:
 
1.
 
Hernia
 
(excluding
 
patients
 
with
 
recent
 
outcome
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
follow-up
 
time
 
window)
.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
negative
 
control
 
outcome
 
where
 
no
 
difference
 
in
 
effect
 
is
 
expected
 
for
 
tirzepatide
 
vs
 
dulaglutide.
 
2.
 
Lumbar
 
radiculopathy
 
(excluding
 
patients
 
with
 
recent
 
outcome
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
follow-up
 
time

Th
is
 
is
 
a

outcome
 
where

6.4.3
 
Context
 
and
 
rationale
 
for
 
follow-up
 
 
Both
 
on-treatment
 
(OT)
 
and
 
intention-to-treat
 
(ITT)
 
analyses
 
will
 
be
 
conducted.
 
Adherence
 
in
 
clinical
 
practice
 
databases
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
much
 
worse
 
than
 
in
 
the
 
trial,
 
therefore
 
the
 
OT
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
primary
 
analysis.
 
The
 
OT
 
analysis
 
targets
 
the
 
relative
 
hazard
 
of
 
outcomes
 
while
 
on
 
treatment
 
and
 
may
 
more
 
closely
 
emulate
 
the
 
effect
 
observed
 
in
 
highly
 
adherent
 
trial
 
participants.
 
Both
 
OT
 
and
 
ITT
 
analyses
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
with
 
up
 
to
 
1-year
 
follow-up.

databases:
 
Optum

(2022-2023).

from
 
the

will
 
only
 
be
 
included
 
if
 
sufficient

Strengths
 
of

source(s):
 
Each

and
 
medication

The

has
 
high

While

of

Amazon
 
EC2,
 
Amazon
 
EBS,
 
and
 
Amazon
 
VPC
 
are
 
integrated
 
with
 
AWS
 
CloudTrail,
 
a
 
service
 
that
 
provides
 
a
 
record
 
of
 
actions
 
taken
 
by
 
a
 
user,
 
role,
 
or
 
an
 
AWS
 
service
 
in
 
Amazon
 
EC2,
 
Amazon
 
EBS,
 
and
 
Amazon
 
VPC.
 
CloudTrail
 
captures
 
all
 
API
 
[INVESTIGATOR_567831]2,
 
Amazon
 
EBS,
 
and
 
Amazon
 
VPC
 
as
 
events,
 
including
 
calls
 
from
 
the
 
console
 
and
 
from
 
code
 
calls
 
to
 
the
 
APIs.
 
MGB
 
IT/security
 
staff
 
have
 
full
 
access
 
to
 
CloudTrail
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
CloudTrail
 
monitoring
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
all
 
times.
 
Amazon
 
CloudWatch
 
Events
 
delivers
 
a
 
near-real-time
 
stream
 
of
 
system
 
events
 
that
 
describe
 
changes
 
in
 
AWS
 
resources.
 
Amazon
 
CloudTrail
 
can
 
log,
 
continuously
 
monitor,
 
and
 
retain
 
account
 
activity
 
related
 
to
 
actions
 
across
 
the
 
MGB
 
AWS
 
infrastructure.
 
CloudTrail
 
provides
 
event
 
history
 
of
 
MGB
 
AWS
 
account
 
activity.
 
This
 
event
 
history
 
simpliﬁes
 
security
 
analysis,
 
resource
 
change
 
tracking,
 
and
 
troubleshooting
 
and
 
complies
 
with
 
requirements
 
to
 
ensure
 
the

ﬁle

is
 
controlled
 
by

Backups:
 
Backups
 
are
 
created
 
using
 
industry
 
recognized
 
Cryptographic
 
mechanisms
 
(e.g.,
 
256-bit
 
AES
 
encryption)
 
as
 
appropriate
 
and
 
required.
 
Data
 
are
 
backed
 
up
 
within
 
the
 
MGB
 
network
 
from
 
the
 
MGB
 
Needham
 
data
 
center
 
to
 
the
 
MGB
 
Marlborough
 
data
 
center
 
via
 
replication/mirroring
 
and
 
47
 
 
volume-level
 
snapshots.
 
AWS
 
Backup
 
supports
 
both
 
instance-level
 
backups
 
as
 
Amazon
 
Machine
 
Images
 
(AMIs)
 
and
 
volume-level
 
backups
 
as
 
separate
 
snapshots
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
resource
 
tags.
 
AMIs
 
allow
 
MGB
 
IT
 
and

staff
 
to
 
create
 
backups
 
of
 
all
 
S3
 
and

We completed a PS overlap weighted comparative analysis using this outcome. The PS included only 3 covariates: age, sex, and combined comorbidity index.

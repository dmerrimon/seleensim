2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
N. gonorrhoeae  poses global public health threats because of emerging antibiotic resistance.   
The WHO estimates over 60 million new cases of N. gonorrhoeae  (Ng) infection occur each year 
worldwide, making it one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection s1. Most 
cases of Ng infection are limited to the lower genital tract, causing urethritis in men and cervicitis 
in women. Antibiotic resistance in Ng presents a major problem in the control of this pathogen2. In 
2018, three cases of extensively drug resistant Ng were identified in Australia and the [LOCATION_008] after treatment failure with currently recommended dual antibiotic therapy
3. Effective 
preventative strategies, particularly vaccines, are urgently needed to reduce the public health burden of Ng infections throughout the world.   
Ng infection in humans does not lead to protective adaptive immune responses. Uncomplicated 
Ng infections are associated with increased risk of recurrent infections. Re- infections with the same 
Ng strain occur at a higher frequency than with other circulating strains in the community, 
indicating there is little strain -specific imm unity to Ng
4. Moreover, male subjects in experimental 
human Ng infection studies show no evidence of immunity upon rechallenge5.    
 OMV -based meningococcal vaccines appear to provide cross- species protection against Ng 
infection.  Effective vaccines for the most p revalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (Nm) have been 
in use in humans for decades. Meningococcal vaccines were first generated against polysaccharide capsular antigens of Nm serogroups A,C,Y, and W. Nm serogroup B (NmB) capsule is a poorly 
immunogenic disaccharide in humans which has made the  deve lopment of vaccines targeting NmB  
IGHID # [ZIP_CODE]  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_5951] A. Duncan, MD, PhD  
Version 1.2/June [ADDRESS_46517] contributed to 
decreased Ng rates in these settings. However, a recent OMV -based vaccine campaign in New 
Zealand demonstrated decreased gonococcal infection rates, and surveillance data showed that infection rates for  Chlamydia trachomatis  (another sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen that 
causes urethritis and cervicitis) did not mirror the decrease in gonorrhea rates. This, and the fact that the effect was greater in vaccinated than unvaccinated persons, strongly supports the 
hypothesis that the Nm vaccine provided specific protection from Ng infection
14. Data from New 
Zealand suggest that the Nm -OMV- based vaccine offered ~30% protection against Ng infection. 
Researchers at the Uniformed Services U niversity of Health Sciences have demonstrated that mice 
vaccinated with the FDA -approved four component NmB OMV vaccine (4CMenB), delivered 
subcutaneously (SC) or intraperitoneally (IP), substantially accelerated Ng clearance and reduced vaginal Ng burdens vs. unvaccinated or adjuvant only- treated animals, supporting the ecologic data 
in humans that suggests Nm -OMV can induce immune responses that protect from Ng.  Serum 
pooled from [ADDRESS_46518] to Nm, infection with 
non-encapsulated Ng weakly  induces antibodies; anti -Ng antibody concentrations in vaginal 
secreti ons and sera are not different in individuals with current or past Ng infection vs. those with 
no history of infection19. The re are few published studies of Ng- directed T cell responses in patients 
with Ng, but one small study showed that T cells from 30 Ng- infected patients exhibited weak 
proliferative responses to gonococcal PorB not significantly greater than proliferation wi thout 
antigen20. Interleukin 17 (IL -17), the main cytokine from Th17 lymphocytes that stimulates 
neutrophil (PMN) recruitment and causes local inflammation, increases during Ng infections in humans and mice
21-23. However, Ng is resistant to PMN killing, leading Russell et al. to suggest 
that stimulation of adaptive Th17 responses to Ng may partially explain the lack of protective immunity to Ng in humans
22. 
 
Identification of the immunologic correlates of protection against N. gonorrhoeae  would provide 
critical information tha t would allow for development and testing of vaccines for the prevention 
of N. gonorrhoeae  infection. Characterization of the anti -gonococcal immune responses that 
develop in response to 4CMenB immunization will provide preliminary data that defines the immunologic parameters that can be assessed in the setting of a clinical trial designed to test the 
efficacy of 4CMenB or other vaccines for protection against N. gonorrhoeae  infection.  There is 
currently no data regarding the identity of gonococcal outermembrane  antigens recognized by 
[CONTACT_44307] 4CMenB immunization as well as no documented reports of the cellular 
IGHID # [ZIP_CODE]  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_5951] A. Duncan, MD, PhD  
Version 1.2/June [ADDRESS_46519] step to defining the immunologic correlates of immunity to N. gonorrhoeae  infection. 
Although the 4CMenB vaccine has been FDA approved, it is not currently required for 
enrollment as a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 4CMenB vaccine 
uptake has been estimated at 14%  based on teen National Immunization Survey data; however, uptake rates between 14% and 98% have been found at Universities that have implemented 
vaccination ca mpaigns in the setting of NmB disease outbreaks
24,25. Thus, it is timely to conduct 
this study while prior MenB  immunization rates in the target population are relatively low.   
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a single center, single arm, interventional pi[INVESTIGATOR_44283] -doses of the 4CMenB vaccine according to the recommended adm inistration 
schedule and will provide blood, pharyngeal swabs, and urine or self- collected vaginal swabs at 
each of four study visits.  
 
The study population will include 15 individuals  aged 18-25 years with no contraindication to 
vaccination and no known immune compromising medical condition or medication .  
 Participants will be seen for informed consent  and eligibility screening . Enrolled participants will 
be given 1 dose of 4CMenB at enrollment and a second dose at week 5. Participants will  be seen 
at entry, weeks 5, 6, and 7 for blood collection , pharyn geal swabs, and provide urine (male 
participants) or self -collected vaginal swabs collected for secondary screening and baseline 
immunologic testing .

The week 6 visit should occur 5-9 days after the second dose of vaccine; if week 6 visit samples 
are not collected , the participant may continue  in the study and attend the week 7 visit 12-16 days 
after receiving the second dose of vaccine. If the week 7 visit is not collected between day 12-16 
after the second dose of vaccine, participant will be discontinued from the study.  
 
Vaccination should be deferred at the discretion of the site investigator if the participant is 
febrile  with reported or observed temperature greater than or equal to 38 °C or acutely ill 
with symptoms (ongoing or present within 7 days of planned vaccination) consistent with 
infection of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], gastrointenstinal tract, urinary tract, or skin/soft tissues.

7.1 Dose Modification  
No modification of the study vaccine dose is allowed.  
 
7.2 Toxicity Management  
7.2.1 Management of Injection Site and Allergic Reactions 
Local and systemic reactions will be graded according to the DAIDS A dverse Event (AE)  
Grading Table, Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, found on the DAIDS RSC Web site: 
http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/ .  
 
Injection Site Reactions 
• Swelling, induration, or redness at the injection  site 
• Pain or tenderness, or other reactions at the injection site  
 
Systemic reactions occurring within 48 hours after vaccination 
• Fever or chills  
• Malaise or fatigue  
• Headache or pain, e.g. , myalgia or arthralgia  
• Nausea or vomiting  
• Allergic reactions, e.g., rash, hives, dyspnea, pruritis 
 
For any Grade [ADDRESS_46540] possibly related to vaccines:  
Grade 1 or 2 Toxicity/AE: 
Participants who develop a Grade 1 or 2 AE may continue  in the study and receive the second 
dose of vaccine (which may be postponed as directed in section 6.3.5) and return for evaluation 
study visits as noted in section 6.2.3. For p articipants experiencing Grade 1 or 2 AEs who choose 
to discontinue study treatment or study participation prior to receiving the second vaccine dose, see section 6.2.4.  
Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity/AE: 
Participants who develop a Grade [ADDRESS_46541] possibly related to vaccine should be re-evaluated for that toxicity until the AE returns to Grade ≤2. Participants who experience  Grade 
[ADDRESS_46542] possibly related to vaccine should not receive the second immunization if 
the AE occurs prior to the week 5 study visit and their par ticipation in the study should be 
discontinued. Participants who experience a grade 3 or 4 AE that  is considered by [CONTACT_44309] 6 and 7 visits if the AE has returned to Grade ≤2. 
For instructions regarding participants experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_46543] possibly related to vaccine that result in premature discontinuation of study vacc ine and/or  study 
participation, see section 6.2.4. These participants should be followed until resolution of the AE Toxicity .

8.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
8.1 Definitions  
 
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. 
 
An unexpected (unlisted) adverse event is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an 
approved product). 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death;  
• is life -threatening; 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 or 
•  is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Other i mportant medical events as assessed by [CONTACT_44310].  
 
An Unanticipated Problem (UP) /New Safety Information (NSI) is defined by [CONTACT_44311], experience, or outcome that: 
• is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• is related or possibly related to a participant’s participation in the research; and  
• suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
 
AE attribution  will be assigned according to the following scale:  
• Not related:  The AE is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of 
the event is mos t plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent 
with the onset of the event).   
• Possibly related:  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the initiation of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of 
other factors. 
• Related:  The AE is clearly related to the study procedures.

 8.2 Reporting  
The protocol- defined expedited event reporting period for this protocol is the entire study 
duration for an individual participant (from study enrollment until study completion or 
discontinuation of the participant from study participation for any reason). 
 
All AEs defined below must be recorded on the eCRFs if any of the following criteria have been 
met: 
• All grade >3 AEs  
• All AEs that led t o a change in study treatment/intervention regardless of grade 
• All AES meeting SAE definition  
 
For all of these adverse events reported or observed, the information should be recorded in the 
electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF) for that participant and will  include a full description of the 
event, its seriousness, its severity or toxicity grade (intensity), the relationship to the study drug, and the treatment, outcome, and sequelae of the event.   
 
Any serious or unexpected event, which occurs to any participant in the course of his/her treatment 
on this study or within [ADDRESS_46544] be reported within 24 hours 
to the principal  investigator.  The immediate reports should be followed promptly by [CONTACT_12908], 
written reports.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_44290]: 
• UNC IRB  if it meets the UNC IRB UP/NSI reporting requirements  
• Events that are reportable to the UNC IRB will also be submitted to the a ppropriate 
representative of the study funding source/ sponsor (NC TraCS) : Marie Rape, RN, BSN, 
Associate Director of Regulatory, NC TraCS ( [EMAIL_829]

9.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
Due to the majority of the target population likely to be undergraduate students, we anticipate that enrollment will be limited to ~[ADDRESS_46557] (months when student 
population residing in Chapel Hill is low) and that the remaining participants will be enrolled at ~6/month in September and October. All Se rum and PBMC will be stored until a complete 
specimen set is obtained from at least 8 subjects ; the serum and PBMC specimens will then be 
transferred to [CONTACT_44325] MacIntyre’s laboratory at Duke University in batch for immunologic 
assays
. We plan to enroll up to [ADDRESS_46558] 8 subjects.

9.5. Analyses  
9.5.1 Statistical Methods : 
Descriptive statistics such as age and gender will be reported in means, standard deviations, 
frequencies, and proportions when appropriate. As recently recommended for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], ours 
will focus on point estimates of immuse responses  and their  80% confidence intervals (CIs) in 
place of 95% CI used for traditional statistical inferences26 .The geometric mean concentration 
(anti-log of the arithmetic mean of log transformed concentration s) of antibodies while the 
arithmetic mean of T cell population frequencies and secreted cytokine levels from in vitro 
antigen- stimulated PBMC will be  identified.  C ompar isons between  measurements of immune 
response in  pre- and post- immunization specimens  (as specified for primary outcome 
measurements) will be completed using paired Student's t- test for normally distributed data or 
Wilcoxon rank signed test  for non-normally distributed data .  For repeated outcome 
measurement s at 4 time points  (as specified in exploratory outcomes) , we will use generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) with unstructured covarianc e matrix to estimate the time difference. 
The link function for GEE will be chosen depending on the data type.   
9.5.2 Sample Size and Power: 
There is only one published report describing the anti-gonococcal antibody titers in [ADDRESS_46560] whole cell N. gonorrhoeae  (stra in 1291) demonstrated a statisti cally significant 
increase between  pre (95% CI : 25,906–90,811) and post (95% CI : 49,228–126,115 ) 
immunization samples
15. We do not have preliminary data and there is no published data 
regarding cross- reactive antibodies in 4CMenB -immunized humans against the N. gonorrhoeae  
strain FA1090 (the strain used by [CONTACT_44314]) or specific FA1090 outer- membrane antigens. Further, there is no published 
data on anti -gonococcal antibody subtype or levels of these antibodies in mucosal surface 
secretions in any 4CMenB -immunized humans. Fin ally, there is no published data regarding 
cellular immune responses to gonococcal antigens in 4CMenB -immunized individuals. Thus, the 
proposed study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_44297] N. 
gonorrhoeae  antigens is unknown. The study will provide baseline values and variability in 
measurements for non -immune individuals as well as post immunization measurements for the 
studied immunologic parameters . We will enroll up to 15 individuals, including similar numbers 
of men and women; this sample size is proposed based on size of potential participant pool and 
available funding for the study. The data generated will provide valuable information for how to 
deploy these assays in hu man populations receiving 4CMenB immunization for testing efficacy in 
preventing N. gonorrhoeae  infection in the future.

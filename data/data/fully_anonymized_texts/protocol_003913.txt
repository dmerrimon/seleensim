CLINICAL PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Sponsor:  CDC 
Title:  Open -Label, Randomized Study of Immune Response to Licensed Influenza Vacc ines in 
Adults 65 -74 Years of A ge 
Study short name: [CONTACT_301985] -Label Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (OLIVE)  
Vaccines:  Fluvirin , Fluzone High -Dose, Fluad , FluBlok  
Regimen and Dosing:  Subjects will receive a  0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection of one of three 
licensed 2016 -17 influe nza vaccines at study visit 1  and either 2017 -18 Fluzone High -Dose (HD-
IIV3) , Fluad (aIIV3)  or FluBlok (RIV3)  at study visit 4 (approximately 1 year after enrollment) .  
Study Rationale:  
Influenza vaccination is recommended annually for all persons aged ≥[ADDRESS_697698] been developed and are recommended for persons aged ≥65 years , including 
vaccines with increased amounts of antigen (high dose) or adjuvant , to increa se immune 
response. The recombinant influenza vaccine has also shown high effectiveness in older adults.  
Immunologic response to influenza vaccination is dependent on age and pre -existing antibody 
levels from prior exposure either to vaccination or disease . Recent observational studies of 
influenza vaccine effectiveness have suggested that prior season vaccination status may be an 
important factor in vaccine protection , but studies have been inconsistent . Limited data suggest 
that repeat high -dose vaccination does not interfere with immune response while there are no 
data on immune response to repeat vaccination with adjuvanted vaccines.  
 
Given the universal recommendation for annual vaccination for all adu lts, increased risk of 
complications from influenza infection in older adults,  and the availability of vaccines 
specifically formulated to increase immune response to vaccination for persons aged ≥65 years, 
a better understanding of the humoral immune resp onse to repeat influenza vaccination and 
vaccine type in this population is needed.  There is currently no preferential recommendation 
for a specific vaccine for the population  aged ≥[ADDRESS_697699] dose vaccines upon vaccination and revaccination 
will help to guide vaccine policy for this age group.  
 
Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
 Compare immune responses to vaccine and drifted viruses as measured by 
[CONTACT_35318] (HI) among p ersons aged 65 -74 years vaccinated with one of 
two licensed influenza vaccines: high -dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ( HD-IIV3) 
or trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine with adjuvant (aIIV3 ) approximately 28 days, 6 
months, and 1 year after r eceipt of the 2016 -17 vaccine  
 Compare immune responses to vaccine and drifted viruses as measured by [CONTACT_535986] (2016 -17 and 2017 -18) with HD-IIV3 and aIIV3  
approximately 28 days and 6 months after receipt of the 2 017-18 vaccine.

(MFR), seroresponse rate (SRR), and seroprotection rate (SPR).  
 Seroresponse  rate defined as the proportion of subjects with paired samples with 
prevaccination HI titer <1:10 and postvaccination (day 28) HI titer ≥1:[ADDRESS_697701] a 
4-fold increase in HI from prevaccination HI titer ≥1:10.  
 Seroprotection rate defined as the propor tion of subjects with postvaccination HI 
titer ≥1:40.

Surveillance for Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_19269]:  
From approximately November 1, 2016 through April 1, 2017 and November 1, 2017 through 
April 1, 2018, subjects will enter passive and active surveillance for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]. 
Surveillance will include:  
 Instructions to contact [CONTACT_535991][INVESTIGATOR_4375] . 
 Weekly calls from study staff to solicit respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]  
“New onset” will require a period  free of symptoms, or with baseline symptoms, and at least [ADDRESS_697709] a nasal and throat swab within 7 days 
of illness onset for influenza testing . 
Subjects will continue to receive weekly telephone calls for ascertainment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_037]. Subsequent weekly calls will document resolution, or return to baseline, of 
symptoms . 
Statistical Methods:  
General  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_535992]. Continuous variables will be presented by [CONTACT_535993] (e.g., mean, and 
standard deviation (SD)) for non -immunogenicity endpoints, and geometric means and their 
95% confidence interval for the immunogenicity endpoints. Categorical variables will be 
presented by [CONTACT_119395]; i.e., frequency co unts and percentages for the non -
immunogenicity endpoints, and the percentages and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the 
immunogenicity endpoints.  
 
Analyses of Primary Objectives  
Geometric mean  HI antibody titers at each time point will be compared by [CONTACT_29299].  For 
the primary aim, adults receiving high dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine will be 
compared with those receiving aIIV3 . Linear mixed -effects models will be used to adjust for 
variables such as age, given the potential for sm all differences in age and the known difference 
in GMT by [CONTACT_654] , baseline antibody titer and prior season vaccination status . The mean fold rise 
(MFR), defined as the mean of the ratio of post vaccination GMT and pre -vaccination GMT  for 
each subject,  between  the groups will be computed from  mixed -effects model along with its 
associa ted 95% CI .

Power Considerations  
A sample size of 60 per group will provide over 90% power using a one -sided, two -sample t -test 
to conclude that one vaccine group is superior as defined by [CONTACT_535994] a null hypothesis of 
equality if the GMT values differ by [CONTACT_3450] 20%.

1 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Influenza is an important cause of death and serious illness among persons aged ≥[ADDRESS_697710] traditionally 
targeted persons aged ≥[ADDRESS_697711] been 
developed and are recommended for persons aged ≥65 years , including vaccines with increased 
amounts of antigen (high dose) or adjuvant , to increase immune response.  One advantage of 
adjuvanted vaccines may be cross -protection a gainst antigenically drifted influenza viruses,8 
while cross -protection provided by [CONTACT_5019] -dose vaccine is unknown.   Additionally, recombinant 
influenza vaccine, licensed for all adults aged ≥[ADDRESS_697712] infl uenza A among adults aged ≥50 
years  during a season with an antigenic mismatch  between circulating and vaccine influenza 
strains (relative efficacy: 36; 95% CI 14 to 53){Dunkle, 2017 #2603}.  There is currently no 
preferential recommendation for a specific  vaccine for the population  aged ≥[ADDRESS_697713] 
dose vaccines upon vaccination and revaccination will help to guide vaccine policy for this age 
group.  
 
The immune response to influenza vaccine in older adults, particularly those with chronic 
disease, is less well studied than that of younger, healthier adults and children .  
Immunosenescence likely increases the risk of disease in older adults while at the same time, 
decreases the desired response to vaccination .9 Moreover, while hemaggluti nin inhibition (HAI) 
titers have typi[INVESTIGATOR_535979], with a 4 -fold or 
greater increase in titers associated with a 50% reduction in infection ,[ADDRESS_697714] that repeat high -dose vaccination does not interfere with immune response while 
there are no data on immune response to repeat vaccination with adjuvanted vaccines.17

Given the universal recommendation for annual vaccination for all adults and the availability of 
vaccines specifically formulated to increase immune response to vaccination for persons aged

there is evidence of differing immune response given the type of vaccin e received  or the order

Version 3.0 –July 201 7  Page 17 
 
16 influenza vaccine. Within each group ( vaccinated or unvaccinated in 2015 -16), sequential 
enrollment numbers will be randomly assigned to each vaccine group in random blocks ranging 
from four to ei ght. This will ensure proper distribution of subjects across vaccine group 
assignment.  
 
In Fall 2017, only participants who received IIV in 2016 -17 will be randomized. We will use 
stratified block randomization and subjects will be stratified based on par ticipation in this study 
during the 2016 -17 season  (previously participated or new recruit) .  
 
This is an open -label study, therefore the vaccine type will be known to the participant. Trained 
research staff will prepare and administer the influenza vaccin e.  Randomization to vaccination 
type will  occur at the participant’s first study visit after eligibility is confirmed and informed 
consent obtained . Those enrolled in year [ADDRESS_697721]’s participation in the study is approximately two years.  
 
4 VACCINES  
All subjects will  receive an FDA approved and recommended influenza vaccine  in each season . 
Any individual with a contraindication to influenza va ccination will be unable to participate in 
the study. The four influenza vaccines that will be used in this study are 1) IIV3 (Fluvirin ,

7 SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING  
All blood samples will be collected at the Marshfield Clinic Central Laboratory by [CONTACT_32341] . 
The blood samples will be collected using Vacutainer tubes, with uniformly colored tops 
according to type of proce ssing (e .g., red tops for serum), and appropriately labeled with a 
uniform scheme (including study ID and collection time point). Up to [ADDRESS_697738] samples by [CONTACT_19288]. Sample 
quality (human RNase P) will be monitored by [CONTACT_937] -PCR to ensure adequate sample collection 
procedures.  
 
To support better understanding of the immune response following influenza vaccination, 
specimens will be banked for future studies that might involve respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711] . 
7.1 Serum  
For serum collection, whol e blood drawn in a tube without anticoagulant will be left at room 
temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and maximum of 2 hours. The samples will then be 
placed at 4ᵒ C. Samples will be processed within 24 hours of collection, and ideally the following 
morning for these afternoon/evening appointments. Tubes will be placed in a table -top 
centrifuge and serum will be clarified by [CONTACT_128934] [ADDRESS_697739] com pleted all required blood draws, batched samples will be 
shared with collaborators at the CDC (or their designee) in order to conduct  serologic assays .

7.2 Swabs  
Combined nasal and  oropharyngeal (throat) swab s for influenza testing will be collected by 
[CONTACT_535996]. The nasal swab is quick and painless, and we have found that it 
is acceptable and well -tolerated . The nasal swab is collected by [CONTACT_4859] a large Dacron or 
rayon tipped swab into one nostril to a depth of [ADDRESS_697740] will be drawn for influenza serology testing at each of 
the six scheduled study visits. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibod y titers  will be 
determined for all subjec ts at all time -points . Testing for v irus neutralizing antibody titers, 
neuraminidase antibody mediated inhibition titers, and anti -human CD107a antibody titers will 
depend on HI results. Serologic parameters will include geometric mean titers (GMT), mean f old 
rise (MFR), seroresponse rate (SRR), and seroprotection rate (SPR) by [CONTACT_29299].  Additional 
measures of humoral immune function may also be examined.  
 
A brief description of each serological assay is provided in the following sections.  
8.[ADDRESS_697741] collected at each of the 6 study visits  will be tested by 
[CONTACT_35318] (HI) assays to estimate antibody titers against the 201 6-17 vaccine 
strains and representative strains of circulating influenza viruses that are antigenically or 
genetically different during 2016 -17 season  in year 1 (visits 1, 2, 3 and 4) and 2016 -17 and 
2017 -18 vaccine strains and representative strains of circulating influenza viruses that are 
antigenically or genetically different  during 2017 -18 season  in year 2 (visits 4, 5, and 6)  using 
standard techniques .19 Each serum sample is tested in duplicate and the final titer is the 
geometric mean titer (GMT) of the duplicate titers.  HI testing will be conducted at CDC or by a 
CDC-designated laboratory.   
8.[ADDRESS_697742] microneutralization  (MN) assay, 
which  is a highly  sensitive and specific assay for detecting virus -specific neutralizing antibodies 
to influenza viruses.19Testing for MN titers will depen d on the circulating virus for each season.  
Each serum sample will be  tested in duplicate and the final titer is the geometric mean titer 
(GMT) of the duplicate titers.  MN testing will be conducted at CDC.

Version 3.0 –July 201 7  Page 24 
 
8.3 Neuraminidase Antibody Testing  
Testing to  assess n euraminidase antibody mediated inhibition of influenza viruses with the 
neuraminidase inhibition assay (NAI) will depend on HI responses.  Neuraminidase inhibition 
assays will be conducted at CDC  using standard techniques .19 
 
The NAI assay, also known as the enzyme -linked lectin assay, measures antibodies that inhibit 
the enzymatic activity of viral neuraminidase, utilizing a reassortant influenza virus with a 
mismatched h emagglutinin (H6 subtype), to avoid interference by [CONTACT_33821] -specific antibodies, and 
neuraminidase from vaccine reference viruses. The percent inhibition of neuraminidase 
enzymatic activity at each serum dilution is calculated by [CONTACT_535997] (virus but no serum); end -point NAI titers are calculated as the reciprocal of the 
highest dilution with at least 50% inhibition.   
8.4 Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytot oxicity  (ADCC)  Analysis  
A modified i nfluenza HA -specific antibody -dependent  cell-mediated cytotoxicity natural killer 
(NK) cell activation assay  will be quantified using a modified ADCC natural killer (NK) cell 
activation assay.[ADDRESS_697743] serum dilution that achieved  the 3% of the arbitrary 
threshold. Each serum sample is tested in duplicate and the final titer is the geometric mean 
titer (GMT) of the duplicate titers.  ADCC testing will be conducted at CDC.  
8.5 RT-PCR 
Nasal and oropharyngeal (throat) swab s will be combine d and tested using real -time reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) by [CONTACT_535998].  CDC primers, probes, and procedures 
will be used for this assay. This PC R assay was developed and evaluated by [CONTACT_29510]. Standard 
operating procedures for RT -PCR have been developed and will be followed.  Total nucleic 
extractions will be  performed using the [COMPANY_002] MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Kit ([COMPANY_002] 
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, I N) on 200 μl of clinical samples . This is a high throughput, automated 
magnetic bead technology.  Real -time RT-PCR will be performed on nucleic acid extracts using 
the LightCycler® Real -Time PCR System  ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The RT-PCR 
assay is a TaqMan® based real -time detection of the matrix protein (M1) of influenza A and the 
non-structural protein 1  (NS1)  of influenza B. Both have been shown to be highly conserved, 
representing effective targets for detection.  For each sample, the in itial RT-PCR amplifies  
nucleic acid for type A and type B . The human RNase P gene primer and probe set serves as the 
internal positive control for human RNA. Samples positive for influenza A will be  retested for 
subtype identification. These include primer s for H1N1pdm09 , and H3 . Samples positive for 
influenza B will be  further tested for B lineage.

10 SHARING OF LABORATOR Y SPECIMENS AND DATA  
Mars hfield Clinic Research Institute  will share participant samples (serum and swabs) with CDC , 
or a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_29510] . Record review and vaccination history data will also be 
shared with  CDC, with appropriate privacy measures in place.  
 
[ADDRESS_697745] procedures to ensure accurate and complete data collection. Access will 
require documentation of informed consent, responses to all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
specimen collection dates, and vaccination information (date, type, manufacturer, and lot 
number). Radio buttons, pi[INVESTIGATOR_535982] -programmed data checks will be used to ensure valid 
data entry. Access records will be exported to SAS files for final analyse s. RECIN immunization 
records will be merged with Access enrollment records to define exposure (vaccination) status.  
 
Reports will be generated on a regular basis to track recruitment, enrollment, and study visit 
completion and shared with collaborators d uring bi -weekly conference calls.  
11.2 Data Quality Assurance  
Study data will be entered by [CONTACT_3665]. The study programmer will monitor and 
review the study databases regularly. The study programmer will run a series of quality checks 
and validation  to look for missing, incomplete, or inconsistent data. Any identified data issues 
will be reconciled with study staff prior to finalization of the dataset and analysis.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 General  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_535999]. Continuous variables will be presented by [CONTACT_148216] (e.g., mean, and 
standard deviation (SD)) for non -immunogenicity endpoints, and geometric means a nd their 
95% confidence interval for the immunogenicity endpoints. Categorical variables will be 
presented by [CONTACT_119395]; i.e., frequency counts and percentages for the non -
immunogenicity endpoints, and the percentages and their 95% confidence  intervals for the 
immunogenicity endpoints.  
 
12.2 Analyses Addressing Objectives  
 Analyses of Primary O bjectives  12.2.1
After log transformation of the antibody titers , geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) pre - and 
post - vaccination will be compared within subjects by  [CONTACT_338593].  For the primary aim, adults 
receiving high dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine will be compared  with those 
receiving aIIV3 .  
 
The mean and standard deviation of log titers will be calculated. Linear mixed -effects models 
will be use d to adjust for variables such as age, given the potential for small differences in age 
and the known difference in GMT by [CONTACT_654] , baseline antibody titer and prior season vaccination 
status . The mean fold rise (MFR), defined as the mean of the ratio of post vaccination GMT and 
pre-vaccination GMT  for each subject,  between the groups will be computed from  mixed -
effects model along with its associated 95% confidence interval (CI).  For the declaration of non -
inferiority of GMT between groups, the lower bound of  the adjusted 95% CIs for the GMT ratios 
will be determined for each strain.   
 Analyses of Secondary O bjectives  12.2.2
Analyses of virus neutralizing antibody titers, neuraminidase antibody mediated inhibition 
titers, and anti -human CD107a antibody titers  will be similar to HI data described above. 
Secondary analyses will also include comparisons of GMT  for HI and neuraminidase inhibition 
assays, seroconversion rates, and ADCC measures by [CONTACT_536000].  
 
If vaccine failures (RT -PCR confirmed influenza infection) occur, we will assess factors 
associated with failure using logistic regression, including vaccine type.

Version 3.0 –July 201 7  Page 27 
 
12.3 Power Considerations  
Study sample size was based on available resources. For the analysis on HI titers, a sample size 
of 60 per group will provide over 90%  power using a one -sided, two -sample t -test to conclude 
that one vaccine group is superior as defined by [CONTACT_535994] a null hypothesis of equality if the 
GMT values differ by [CONTACT_3450] 20%.

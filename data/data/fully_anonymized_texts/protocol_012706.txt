70 versus 110 Degrees Side-cut Angles in Femtosecond Laser-assisted in situ Keratomileusis
6. Study Purposes and Objectives:
Different side-cut angles have been used in Femtosecond Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (FS-LASIK), but no
study has compared the safety and efficacy of [ADDRESS_1045424] comparison of outcomes, minimizing confounding variables. Additionally , the LASIK
flap will be performed using either the Abbott Medical Optics Intralase femtosecond laser or the Alcon W avelight
FS200 femtosecond laser.

8. Background and Introduction:
Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis has become the preferred corneal procedure to correct certain refractive errors.
Technological advances have increase the accuracy and precision of current treatments. One of the major
advancements in LASIK has been the introduction of Femtosecond Laser technology for flap creation. Several
studies have compared microkeratome and femtosecond laser technology , showing superior accuracy and precision
of flap dimensions in the latter.
The Femtosecond Laser technology provides different parameters and settings that can be changed according to the
surgeon's preference. One of such parameters is the side-cut angle. Some of the most common side-cut angles used
today include 45, 70, 90, and [ADDRESS_1045425] reported on the visual outcomes of side-cut angles,
but head to head comparisons are lacking.  Currently, there are no studies comparing the safety and efficacy of the
70 and 110 side-cut angles in FS-LASIK. Information regarding the outcomes and complication rates between these
side-cut angles will provide an objective measure that can be used when deciding which one is more suitable in FS-
LASIK.

completed in the research project.
Patients who are interested and eligible to participate in this study will sign the study informed consent prior to
surgery. As is standard for our LASIK cases, they will also be required to watch an informational video, read and sign
the “Consent to Have Refractive Surgery” and respond to a brief test concerning its content.
All surgical procedures will be performed according to the surgeons’ standard practices. The study outcome
measures are standard of care for pre-operative and post-operative evaluation of refractive surgery patients.
All study outcome measures will be evaluated for both eyes at every visit. Patient will be masked as to the treatment
they receive in either eye so as not to influence their sunjective responses and visual measurements.  Post-operative
evaluations will be performed at 1 day, 1 week (± 3 days), 1 month (± 10 days), 3 months (± 14 days), 6 months (± 1
month), and 12 moths (± 1 month). Interim examinations may be performed as necessary according to the surgeon’ s
usual care, but are not considered part of the study data.
Patients will be discontinued from the study if, on the day of surgery , both eyes cannot be randomized and operated
as per protocol. Patients have the right to withdraw at any time and future medical care will not be influenced by [CONTACT_763010].
Patients will be evaluated with the following procedures:
·       Manifest refraction (sphere, cylinder and axis): Pre op and post-op months 1 (± 10 days), 3 (± 14 days), 6 (± 1
month), and 12 (± 1 month).
·       Uncorrected corrected visual acuity: Pre-op and post-op day 1, week 1, and months 1 (± 10 days), 3 (± 14
days), 6 (± 1 month), and 12 (± 1 month) using the Snellen Eye chart
·       Best corrected visual acuity: Pre-op and post-op months 3 (± 14 days), 6 (± 1 month), and 12 (± 1 month).
·       Pupil size measured in the dark: Pre-op only
7. Are all procedures for research purposes only (non-standard or non-standard of care procedures)?
  Yes No
If no, list the procedures that are performed for research purposes only (non-standard or non-standard
of care procedures):
Data collection and analysis are for research purposes only.
8. Is there a safety monitoring plan for this study?
  Yes No
9. Provide a summary of the statistical methods, data analysis, or data interpretation planned for this study .
Factors for determining the proposed sample size (e.g., power) should be stated.
Summary statistics will be calculated and used to describe the treatment groups (70 versus 1 10 degrees side-cut
angles) in terms of all study variables: manifest refraction, corrected and uncorrected visual acuity and LASIK system
used (FS200 or intralase). Statistics will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_763005], one month, three month, six month and [ADDRESS_1045426] op
corrrected and corrected visual acuities. In order to provide a statitistically significant beta values, a N number of 200
patients will be needed.

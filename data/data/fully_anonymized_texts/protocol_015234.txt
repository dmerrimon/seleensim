 1.1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
1.2 Summary  
 
This will be a single -institution,  non-randomized,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_28598] 7 patients  at MSKCC  
Main  Campus.  
 
We wish to study  ribavirin  in this patient population  because: (1) eIF4E  can function  as an 
oncogene; (2)  we have  recently  found  that expression  of phosphorylated  eIF4E is 
associated  with p16-positive  tonsillar  squamous  cell carcinoma  (3) ribavirin  has been  shown  
to decrease  eIF4E  levels  in vivo. 
 
The Primary  Aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_545954] 2 weeks  decreases  
tumor  expression  of phosphorylated  eIF4E  among  patients  with tonsillar  and/or base  of 
tongue  squamous  cell carcinoma.  
 
Subjects will have  tonsil  and/or base  of tongue  squamous  cell carcinoma  that is previously  
untreated.  
 
Subjects will not have  a history of more  than [ADDRESS_714528]  had a  prior diagnostic  surgical or core needle  biopsy.   Patients  for whom  definitive  
local-regional  treatment (primary  surgery  or primary  radiation  therapy  +/- chemotherapy,  
given  sequentially  or concurrently)  is planned  will be offered  participation  in the study.  
Subjects will take ribavirin  800 mg/day  in divided  doses  for two weeks, which  is a standard  
time frame  for pre-operative  planning.   Patients  will be evaluated  in clinic  by [CONTACT_545982]  1 and week  2. (For patients  who undergo  research  biopsy,  this will 
be performed  in the clinics  of the Head  and Neck  Disease  Management Team.)  
 
Patients  will be considered  done  with treatment at time of surgery  and/or research  biopsy.  
 
Post-surgical  (or post research  biopsy) management  will be off  protocol,  according  to 
established  standards  of care.

3.1 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.2 HPV/p16 -positive  HNSCC  is a distinct  clinical  and biological  entity  
 
HNSCC  comprises  at least two distinct  clinical entities:   HPV-positive  tumors  and HPV- 
negative  tumors (1).   Approximately  half of oropharynx  (tonsil,  base  of tongue)  squamous  
cell carcinomas  are HPV-positive,  but tumors  arising  at other  sites in the upper  aerodigestive  
tract (i.e.,  oral cavity,  hypopharynx,  or larynx)  generally  are not associated  with HPV (1). 
HPV-negative  tumors  typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occur  in individuals  with histories  of tobacco  abuse,  whereas  
HPV-positive  HNSCC  usually  is not associated  with tobacco  abuse  (2, 3).  In a prospective  
randomized  clinical trial  of cisplatin  plus concurrent radiation  in HNSCC,  HPV-positive  
squamous  cell carcinomas  arising  in the oropharynx  were  associated  with superior overall  
survival  compared  with HPV-negative  oropharynx  tumors  (4). 
 
Potentially,  differences  in the molecular pathogenesis  mechanisms  of these  tumors account  
for their distinct treatment  responsiveness.   Landmark  cytogenetic  studies  of HNSCC  
demonstrate  frequent gene  loss at the locus  enco ding p16 and p14 (CDKN2A ), and 
amplification  at the gene  locus  encoding  cyclin  D1 (5-7)  Whereas  p16 loss and cyclin  D1 
amplification  characterize  HPV-negative  (tobacco -related) tumors,  p16 overexpression  and 
downregulation  cyclin  D1 typi[INVESTIGATOR_545955]-positive  tumors  (8). The high p16/low  cyclin  D1 profile  
in HPV-positive  tumors  is due to loss  of negative  feedback  on p16 when  the E7 viral 
oncoprotein  inactivates  the pRB tumor suppressor  protein  (1, 9). Immunohistochemical  
detection  of p16 is a marker for HPV-associated  carcinogenesis  in HNSCC  (10-12). 
 
In summary,  HPV-positive  and HPV-negative  head and neck  cancers  are distinct  at the 
molecular  pathology  level.  There  are converse  molecular  profiles  for HPV-positive  tumors

 (ie, overexpression  of p14 and p16; downregulation  of cyclin  D1; p53 wildtype)  and HPV- 
negative  tumors  (ie, overexpression  of cyclin  D1; downregulation  p14, p16 and p21; p53 
mutan t) (3, 8, 10, 13-15), and these  molecular profiles  can inform  the development of clinical  
studies.  
 
3.3 Rationale  for targeting  eIF4E  in HPV/p16 -positive  tumors  
 
The translation  initiation  factor eIF4E  is a central regulator  of gene  expression  (16). eIF4E  
binds  the 7-methyl  guanosine  (m7G) cap structure  in the  5’ end of mRNAs,  and selectively  
stimulates  the translation  of several  oncogenic  transcripts  that are repressed  under normal  
circumstances.   Malignancy  related  mRNAs  that are regulated  at the level of translation  by 
[CONTACT_329240]4E include  cyclin  D1, VEGF,  bcl-2, MMP -9 and Pim-1 (16, 17). Wendel and colleagues  
demonstrated  that eIF4E  functions  as an oncogene  and confers resistance  to therapeutic  
mTOR  inhibition  in a murine  lymphoma  model  (18, 19). 
 
In 1999  clinicopathologic  study  of 65 HNSCC  surgical cases, Nathan  and colleagues  reported  
that expression  of eIF4E  was detectable  by [CONTACT_545983].   
Expression  of eIF4E  in histologically  tumor -free margins  was present  in 55% of specimens,  
and was associated  with a significantly  increased  risk of tumor recurrence  (20).                 
This group  subsequently  demonstrated  that antisense  inhibition  of eIF4E  mRNA  reduced  the 
malignant  properties  of a HNSCC  cell line (FaDu),  as measured  by [CONTACT_545984],  reduced  growth  in soft agar,  and reduced  tumor  growth  in xenograft  mouse  models  
(21). Growth  inhibitory effects  also were  observed  when  another  HNSCC  cell ine 
(UMSCC22B)  was subjected  to eIF4E  silencing  with siRNAs  (22). As further  evidence  of 
eIF4E’s  central  role in translation  regulation  in HNSCC  cells,  eIF4E -targeted  suicide  gene  
therapy  in a murine  model of HNSCC  (SCC -7 cells)  improved  disease -free survival  (23). 
 
Our current interest in  eIF4E  in head and neck  cancer  is an offshoot  of our DMT’s  research  
program  into inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR  pathway  (IRB 06-129, IRB  08-138, IRB  09- 
028, IRB  09-131).   To explore  if expression  levels  of any proteins  in this pathway  are 
associated  with p16 status,  we constructed  a tissue  microarray  (TMA)  with 46 archived  tonsil  
squamous  cell carcinoma  specimens  (24). The TMA was interrogated  with antibodies  
directed  against  proteins  in this pathway  and against  p16.  The antibody  panel  included  anti- 
eIF4ESer209, because  phosphorylation of eIF4E appears to be  essential  for oncogenic  activity  
(19, 25). 
 
We demonstrated  that downstream  components  of the PI3K pathway,  such as  
phosphorylated  Akt and  S6, are expressed  in the majority  of the specimens  (24),  in 
agreement  with the results  of the Head  and Neck  Cancer Tissue  Array  initiative  (26).  Sixty - 
five percent of the tumors  expressed  p16, the marker  for HPV-driven  carcinogenesis ( 10-12). 
The salient  new finding  was that p16 expression  was associated  with expression  of 
phosphorylated  eIF4E  (p= 0.03,  Table  1) (24). Expression  of p16 also correlated  with 
expression  of p21 (p = 0,02, Table  1) (24), in agreement with the immunohistochemistry  
study  of Hafkamp  (8). There  was no association  between  expression  of p16 and 
phosphorylated  S6 or phosphorylated  4E-BP1.  In agreement with multiple  reports  regarding  
HPV-status  and tobacco  history  (2, 3), we found a  significant correlation  between  history  of 
tobacco  abuse  (>10 pack/years) and  absence  of p16 expressio n (p = 0.01)  (24).

Note:   For the following  antibodies,  tumor  sample  was missing  from the TMA for   one patient each:   p21, p53,

4E-BP1Thr37/46  and phosphorylated  S6Ser235/236  (24). 
 
 
The association  between  p16 and  phosphorylated  eIF4E expression  has potential  
implications  for clinical study.    In the context  of the central role  of eIF4E  in the translation  of 
proteins  encoded  by [CONTACT_545985]  (27), the association  between  p16 and phosphorylated  
eIF4E  may reflect  interplay  between  virus  and cellular  translational apparatus.  In cells 
infected  with herpes  simplex virus -1 or vaccinia  virus,  phosphorylation  of eIF4E by  [CONTACT_248563]-1 is 
critical  for viral protein  synthesis  and replication  (28, 29).  It is not known  if similar  
mechanism occurs  in HPV-positive  HNSCC,  but HPV  is associated  with increased  cap- 
dependent translation in  differentiating  cervical  cancer  cell lines  (30), and eIF4E staining  is 
increased  in cervical neoplasia  (31). 
 
In summary,  several  observations  indicate that eIF4E  is an attractive  research  target  in 
HPV/p16  positive  tonsillar  squamous  cell carcinoma:  (1) eIF4E  expression  has prognostic  
significance  in HNSCC  (2) eIF4E  knockdown  in HNSCC  cell lines is associated  with reduced  
tumorigenicity  (3) phosphorylated  eIF4E is associated  with p16 status  in a tonsil  squamous  
cell carcinoma  tissue  microarray  (4) eIF4E  is critical  for viral protein  synthesis  in other  
systems.

In 1972, the guanosine  ribonucleotide  analogue  ribavirin  (Virazole®; 1-β-D-ribofuranosyl - 
1,2,4 -triazole -3-carboxamide)  was reported  to have  broad  spectrum  activity against both  
RNA and DNA  viruses.  The combination  of ribavirin  + peginterferon  (PEG -IFN) α-2b is an 
effective  treatment for chronic  hepatitis  C. The most  common  adverse  events  associated  
with ribavirin  are mild anemia, cough, and  rash. For  patients  treated  with prolonged  ribavirin,  
anemia  usually  is mild and hemoglobin  remains  in the normal range  (32, 33).  Risk factors  
for moderate  to severe  anemia  with ribavirin  are advanced  age, low body  weight,  hepatic  or 
renal insufficiency,  and baseline  marrow  dysfunction  (34-36). In the current  study,  eligibility  
criteria  exclude  patients  with factors  that might put them at increased  risk of  anemia  with 
ribavirin.  
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_149966] (n = 1530  subjects)  establishing  PEG -IFN α-2b + ribavirin  efficacy  against  
chronic  hepatitis  C showed that treatment for 48 weeks  with PEG -IFN α-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week)  
and a flat dose  of ribavirin  (800 mg/day)  was statistically  superior  to IFN α-2b or low-dose  
(0.5 µg/kg/week) of PEG-IFN α-2b and weight -based dose  of ribavirin  (1000  – 1200  mg/day)  
(37). A subsequent randomized  clinical trial (n = 5027  subjects)  demonstrated  that a weight - 
based  ribavirin  (800 – 1400  mg/day)  + PEG -INF α-2b was more  effective  than flat-dose  
ribavirin  (800 mg/day)  + PEG -IFN α-2b (38). However,  the improvement in  sustained  
virologic  response  was modest  (44.2%  for weight -based  dosing  versus  40.5%  for flat dosing),  
and appeared  to be restricted  to patients  with HCV  genotype  1. Additionally,  mean  
hemoglobin  levels  decreased  to a lesser  extent  in the flat-dose  group  than in the weight  
based-group  (38). In the current protocol, ribavirin  will be given  at flat dose  of 800 mg/day  to 
optimize  patient safety.  
 
Ribavirin  has been  reported  to have  clinical activity  against laryngeal  papi[INVESTIGATOR_28602]  (LP) in a 
small  non-randomized  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (39). LP, a rare condition  with an incidence  of 
approximately  7.[ADDRESS_714533]  becomes  progressively  occluded  with mucosal  papi[INVESTIGATOR_28603].  Repeated  laser surgery  
for removal of lesions  has been  commonly  applied  as a management  strategy.   In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480],  patients  (3 adults,  1 child)  received  pre-operative  ribavirin  (23 mg/kg  daily)  on the  day 
of laser surgery,  and continued  oral ribavirin  at the same  daily dose  for an additional 6 
months  (only  3 months  for the child).  The viral strain  was HPV-6 in the  papi[INVESTIGATOR_545956], and  was HPV-11 in one patient.  
 
Treatment was generally  well tolera ted, with only one patient requiring  a 25% dose  reduction  
for anemia, which  resolved  with continued  treatment  at the reduced  dose.  Ribavirin  
treatment  was associated  a decrease  in observable  disease  on follow  up examinations,  as 
determined  by a previously  described  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_545957]. Ribavirin  treatment  was associated  
with an increase  in the time interval between  successive  required  surgeries  by a factor  of at 
least  2 in all patients  (39).  No pharmacodynamic  correlates  were  done  in this study. The 
efficacy  of ribavirin  against  laryngeal  papi[INVESTIGATOR_545958] a subsequent  case  
report  (40), and ribavirin  is considered  to be  one treatment option  for this uncommon  entity  
(41). 
 
The mechanism  of ribavirin’s  antiviral activity  is not conclusively  established,  and at least five 
potential  mechanisms  have  been proposed ( 42).  For example, ribavirin  is a potent  
competitive  inhibitor  of cellular  inosine  monophosphate  dehydrogenase  (IMPDH),  thereby  
[CONTACT_545986].  Ribavirin  also 
inhibits  viral 7 -methylguanosine  (m7G) RNA cap synthesis  in vaccinia  virus (43, 44). These  
two mechanisms  may be complementary:   by [CONTACT_545987], ribavirin

 may be more  effective  as a cappi[INVESTIGATOR_545959]  (42). The precise  mechanism  of ribavirin  may 
be influenced  by [CONTACT_545988],  but the cappi[INVESTIGATOR_545960], s uch as HPV-16. 
 
In 2004,  Borden  and colleagues  proposed  that ribavirin  competitively  prevents  eIF4E  from 
binding  the m7G cap of mRNAs, thereby  [CONTACT_545989]  (45). Because  many  capped  mRNAs  are important  for oncogenesis, these  findings  
suggested  that ribavirin  might  potentially  have  activity  against  eIF4E -overexpressing  cancers.   
However,  this particular mechanism  has been  called  into question  as other labs  hav               
e not been  able to reproduce  the finding  that ribavirin  mimics  the m7G cap (46, 47), perhaps  
due to assay  conditions  (48). While  the precise  mechanisms  of ribavirin  require further  
study, subsequent  clinical study  in AML patients  demonstrates  that ribavirin  decreases   
eIF4E  levels  in vivo  (49). 
 
The in vivo demonstration  of the impact  of ribavirin  on eIF4E  levels  was also reported  by 
[CONTACT_545990].  They  evaluated  ribavirin  in a proof -of-principle  study  for patients  
with relapsed  or refractory  AML,  a disease  which  commonly  overexpresses  eIF4E  (49). The 
starting  dose  of ribavirin  was 1000 mg/day, with dose increases  allowed  for lack of response  
at 14 days.  Treatment  was well tolerated; no patient required  dose  reduction  for toxicity.  
Among  [ADDRESS_714534] 
responses,  4 stable  diseases,  2 progressive  diseases,  and 2 patients  were  inevaluable  (49). 
 
Ribavirin  treatment   decreased  levels  of eIF4E  mRNA  (Table  2) and protein  (Table  2, Figure  
1) in AML patients  (49) (including  Supplemental  Data).    Prior to treatment, all  patients  
evaluated  had elevated  eIF4E  mRNA  levels  versus  healthy  controls.  With a  single  
exception,  patients  receiving  28+ days  of therapy  had a 2- to 10-fold drop in eIF4E RNA 
levels  by [CONTACT_4475] 28 (Table  2), and  these  levels  remained  reduced  for the duration  of treatment.  
Levels  of eIF4E  protein  and other  pathway proteins  were  assessed  by [CONTACT_545991], demonstrating  decreases  in eIF4E  levels  with ribavirin  treatment  in each  
case (Figure  1) (49).  Based  on these  encouraging  studies,  a follow -up clinical trial is  
underway  in AML (www.clinicaltrials.gov ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Ribavirin  is also being  evaluated  
in advanced  breast  cancer  (www.clinicaltrials.gov ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]),  due to evidence  of 
aberrant  eIF4E  activity in that disease  (50, 51).

The demonstration  of efficacy  in AML motivates  the exploration  of ribavirin  in other  
malignancies.  Head  and neck  cancer is  an obvious  choice  due to clinical and  preclinical  data 
demonstrating  the eIF4E  appears to play a significant role  (20, 21, 52).   Additionally,  ribavirin  
has potent  antitumor activity  against a HNSCC  cell line (FaDu)  that overexpresses  eIF4E.  In 
vitro, ribavirin  inhibits  phosphorylation  of Akt and reduces    anchorage  independent growth  of FaDu  
cells (53). In a xenograft model using  FaDu  cells,  20 days  of treatment with ribavirin  yielded  a 6- 
fold reduction  in mean  tumor volume  in treated  animals,  compared  with the control  group (45). 
The hypothesis  that this  growth  inhibition  may be mediated  by [CONTACT_202788]’s  effect  of eIF4E is 
supported  by [CONTACT_545995]4E  expression  in FaDu  cells with antisense  
RNA also reduces  the tumorigenic  and angiogenic  properties  of FaDu  cells (21). Taken  
together, we feel that these  observations  support  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_545964].  
In order to enrich  for patient population  that expresses  the eIF4E  target, the study  is limited  to 
never   smokers  (or past oligo  smokers)  with tonsillar  squamous  cell cancer (see Table  1 above).

 3.5 Rationale  for Tissue  Pharmacodynamic  Studies  
 
To obtain  proof -of-principle  regarding  the hypothesis  that ribavirin  is an inhibitor  of eIF4E  (45, 
48, 49), we will compare  pre and post treatment tumor levels  of phosphorylated  eIF4E by  
[CONTACT_9064].   Expression  of phosphorylated  eIF4E  is associated  with p16 positive  
tonsil  squamous  cell carcinoma  (24) [see Table  1 herein].  In AML,  ribavirin  therapy  results  in 
decreased  levels  of eIF4E  mRNA  and protein  (49) [see Figure  1 and Table  2 herein].   eIF4E  
can function  as an oncogene  (18), and  pharmacodynamic  demonstration  of down regulation  
of eIF4E  would  provide  a mechanistic  basis  for further development  of ribavirin  in HPV - 
positive  head and neck  cancer.  
 
As a secondary  endpoint,  we will explore  if ribavirin  alters levels  of selected  proteins  that are 
regulated  by [CONTACT_329240]4E  at the translational  level.   In a model  system with primary human  
mammary epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]  (HMECs),  eIF4E  activates  p16 and  p21 and represses  EGF 
receptor ( 17). This eIF4E -induced  pattern  of expression  (high  p16, high  p21, and low EGFR)  
seen  in HMECs  (17) is very similar  to the protein  expression  patterns  seen  in HPV-positive  
HNSCC  (3, 8, 24).  The striking  similarities  between  expression  patterns  induced  by [CONTACT_329240]4E  
in a HMEC  model system  and the expression  patterns  in HPV-positive  HNSCC  prompt  
exploratory pharmacodynamic  assays  involving  pre and  post-treatment tissue  in this study.  
We wish to obtain  pi[INVESTIGATOR_545965] p16, p21, and/or  
EGFR in  patient tumors in  this study,  which  could  strengthen  the hypothesis  that ribavirin  is 
an inhibitor  eIF4E  activity.  
 
We also wish to explore  if ribavirin  treatment effects  the expression  of viral oncoproteins  E6 
and E7.  HPV-[ADDRESS_714535]  expression  of a bicistronic  mRNA  that 
encodes  E6 and  E7.  Synthesis  of both E6 and E7 from the bicistronic  transcript is  
dependent  on an m7G cap structure  on the 5’end  of the mRNA  (54). In view of the 
hypothesis  that ribavirin  may interfere  with translation  of cap-dependent  mRNA  transcripts  
(43-45), we wish to obtain  pi[INVESTIGATOR_545966] E6 and E7 
might  be a mechanism  of action  for ribavirin  in HPV-positive  tonsil  squamous  cell carcinoma.  
 
 
3.6 Summary  and Future  directions  
 
In this study,  up to 7 evaluable  subjects  will be treated  with ribavirin  for 14 days  to 
evaluate  the pharmacodynamic  effects  of ribavirin  in HPV-positive   oropharynx SCC.  We 
feel that 14 days  is adequate  to demonstrate  the pharmacodynamic  effects  of ribavirin  
because  (1) Ribavirin  pharmacology  is characterized  by [CONTACT_545996]  (Section  5.1); (2) Ribavirin  often causes  mild anemia  within  2 weeks,  consistent  
with rapid  onset clinical activity  of the drug (61);  (3) For other targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_545967]- 
defined  mechanisms  of action  in oncology,  pharmacodynamic  activity   is evident  in 15 days  or 
less (62, 63); (4) In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_545968],  the first response  assessment occurred  at 
14 days  (49). 
 
Squamous  tumors  of tonsil  and base of tongue, both  oropharynx  subsites, share  the same  
underlying  molecular pathology  in which  HPV figures  prominently  in the development  of 
malignancy  (1).  Primary  surgical resection  or primary radiation  +/- chemotherapy  (concurrent  
or sequential)  may be offered  to patients  with either tonsil  or base  of tongue    SCC.  Because  
HPV-driven  pathology  is a shared  characteristic  of SCC  at both of these  subsites, we feel that 
it is appropriate to include  both tonsil  and base  of tongue  SCC  in this study.

 If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_545969]4E,  we would  pursue  further clinical studies  of ribavirin  in head  and neck  cancer.  In view 
of the reported  supra -additive  effects  of cisplatin  + eIF4E  inhibition  against  HNSCC  cancer  
cell lines (22), we would  consider  a phase  I/II study of ribavirin  + low dose  weekly  cisplatin  + 
external beam radiation  therapy  for patients  with stage  III/IVB  HPV-positive  HNSCC.  The 
low-dose  cisplatin  regimen  would  likely  be better  tolerated  than the current  standard  high- 
dose  cisplatin  regimens  (64, 65). We would  also wish to consider  a phase  I/II study  of 
ribavirin  + cisplatin  + docetaxel as induction  chemotherapy  for patients  with stage  III/IVB  
HPV-positive  HNSCC.    The use of [ADDRESS_714536]  induction  chemotherapy  in HNSCC  
which  is three  cytotoxic  agents  (cisplatin, docetaxel,  5-fluorouracil)  (66).  Another study  
option  might  be developed  for patients  who undergo  primary surgery  for head  and neck  
cancer.  In view of the report that  expression  of eIF4E  in histologically  tumor free margins  is 
associated  with increased  risk of recurrence  (20), a post-operative  treatment regimen  
incorporating  ribavirin  would  be an attractive  study  concept.  Each  of the study  concepts  
outlined  above  would  provide  the opportunity  to obtain  adequate  tumor  tissue  for correlative  
studies  to further analyze  the mechanistic  effects  of ribavirin.  Finally,  in view of the worldwide  
burden  of cervical carcinoma  which  is also characterized  by [CONTACT_28621]4E expression  (31), 
these  findings  potentially  could  have  implications  beyond  head and neck  cancer  clinical  
research.

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This will be a single  institution  non-randomized  study  for patients  with tonsil  and/or  base  of 
tongue  squamous  cell cancer.   This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_545970]/or  base  of tongue squamous  cell cancer.  After 
patients  provide  informed  consent, eIF4E expression  in tumors will be measured  by 
[CONTACT_9064].   Those  patients  with tumors  that express  eIF4E  ≥ 30% will be 
deemed  eligible for the study  and will self-administer ribavirin for approximately  14 days.  
The primary  endpoint  is to explore  if ribavirin  decreases  tumor  expression  of phosphorylated  
eIF4E among  patients  with tonsil  and/or  base  of tongue squamous  cell carcinoma.  
Immunohistochemistry  will be performed  on pre-treatment  pathology  samples  (e.g. 
diagnostic  biopsy),  as well as on  the post-treatment  pathology  samples  (e.g. definitive  
surgery or research  biopsy,  to describe  the effects  of ribavirin  treatment on the expression  of 
phosphorylated  eIF4E.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_714537]-operative  (or post research  biopsy)  management  will be according  to standards             
of care off protocol.  
 
For those  patients  who undergo  research  biopsy, this  will be performed  in the clinics  of the 
Head  and Neck  Disease  Management Team.   Research  biopsy  will be performed  on easily  
accessible  lesions.  The phrase “easily  accessible  tumor”  designates  tumors that may be 
biopsied  in an office  setting  with minimal risk of complication  and discomfort  to the patient.  
Common  techniques  for office  biopsy  include  fine needle  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545971],  or 
forceps  cut biopsy  of primary tumor (with local anesthetic).  The method  used  for research  
biopsy  in the clinic  is at the discretion  of the investigator.

Availability  and Administration:  
Generic  ribavirin  is commercially  available  as 200 mg, 400mg, and  600 mg tablets, which  will 
be orally  administered  by [CONTACT_28624].   Ribavirin  will be purchased  from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601].  Tablets  are supplied  in bottles  of 84 capsules (200  mg each).  Ribavirin  is 
available  as blue-colored  (shade  depending  on strength),  capsule -shaped,  film-coated  
tablets.   Medicati on labels  will comply  with US legal requirements  and be printed  in English.  
They  will supply  no clinical information  about the patient  on the labels.  The storage  
conditions  for study  drug will be described  on the medication  label. Ribavirin  tablet  may be 
taken  with food or on an  empty  stomach.  
 
Toxicities  (> 10%):  
 
Hematologic:   anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,  lymphopenia  
Gastrointestinal:   anorexia,  nausea,  diarrhea  
Hepatic:   elevated  liver function  tests  
Pulmonary:   dyspnea, cough  
Reproductive:   may be teratogen  
Constitutional:  fatigue,  musculoskeletal  pain 
Dermatologic:  alopecia, pruritis, rash

Pharmacology:  
 
Ribavirin oral tablet administration  is characterized  by [CONTACT_28625] a tmax of 
approximately  2 hours, followed  by [CONTACT_28626].  Mean  γ- 
phase  half-life has been  reported  to be  in the range  of approximately  30 - 61 hours after a 
single dose,  and 274 - 296 hours  following  multiple  doses.  Mean  bioavailability  is 
approximately  30 - 50%.  Apparent plasma  clearance  is approximately  20 L/h.  Population  
based  pharmacokinetic  models  have  identified  factors associated  with lower  apparent  
clearance  of ribavirin  (female  gender,  higher  age, and low body  weight),  but taken  together  
these  factors account for less than 30% of the variability  in clearance  (34, 67-69).

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.2 Clinical  Plan  
 
The clinical intervention  in this study  is ribavirin  therapy  for approximately  14 days.  Ribavirin  
800 mg/day  is administered  in divided  doses,  400 mg PO qAM and 400 mg PO qPM.   Details  
regarding  evaluations  during  treatment are provided  in Section  10. 
 
9.3 Immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  
 
Each  formalin -fixed  and paraffin -embedded  tissue  specimen  will be processed  for IHC, 
consistent with established  methods  in our group  (70). The time from tumor  removal  at 
surgery to formalin  fixation  should  be 2 hours  or less. 
 
The avidin -biotin  immunoperoxidase  technique  will be employed.   Antigen  retrieval with  citric 
acid (0.01%)  for [ADDRESS_714542]  treatment  commonly  precedes  incubation  with 
the primary antibody  (usually  overnight  at 4oC). Primary antibodies  to be  used  include  anti- 
phospho eIF4ESer209  (rabbit  polyclonal,  Cell Signaling  #9741),  anti-p16 (mouse IgG,  clone  
E6H4,  Dako  #K5334), anti -p21 (mouse  IgG, clone  EA10,  Calbiochem #OP64), anti -EGFR  
(mouse  IgG, clone  31G7,  Ventana  #28-005),  anti-HPV16  E6 (mouse  IgG, clone  C1P5,  Santa  
Cruz  #sc-460),  and anti-E7 (mouse  IgG, clone  8C9, Invitrogen  #28-0006).   Diaminobenzidine  
will be utilized  as the  final chromogen  and hematoxylin  will provide  the nuclear  counterstain.  
 
If limited  tumor tissue  is available,  the top priority  immunostain  will be phosphorylated  eIF4E.  
 
If sufficient tissue  is available,  exploratory analysis  of additional biomarkers  may be 
performed.    For example,  if immunohistochemistry  does  not provide  definitive  data regarding  
levels  of  E6,  E7, and p53, expression  may be explored   with RT PCR using  established  
methods  (71, 72). 
 
Technical difficulty  or inability  to obtain  results  with certain  antibodies  or samples  will not be 
considered  a protocol  violation.

Every attempt  will be made  for patients  to have  clinic  visits  and laboratory  tests  on the 
indicated  dates.   However, dates  may need  to be altered  for medical or personal or logistical  
reasons.  Clinic  visits  and laboratory  studies  may occur 3 days  before  or 3 days  after the 
scheduled  date,  if need  be. Additional clinical visits  and laboratory  studies  may be 
scheduled  if clinically  necessary,  per investigator  discretion.  
 
• On Day 1, routine  laboratory studies  are obtained:  complete  blood  cell count  and 
comprehensive  metabolic  panel.  Patients  undergo  history and  physical.  
 
• Days  1 – 14, approximately:  ribavirin  800 mg/day  in divided  doses,  400 mg q AM and 
400 mg q PM.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897],  this will be administered  as two 200 mg tablets  qAM,  and 
two 200 mg tablets  qPM.   Use of one 400 mg tablet (instead  of two 200 mg tablets)  is 
also allowed,  at the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
• On Day 8, Routine  laboratory  studies  are obtained:  complete  blood  cell count  and 
comprehensive  metabolic  panel.  Patients  undergo  history and  physical.  
 
• Day 15 (approximately):   Surgical plan  is resection  or research  biopsy of the tonsil  
and/or base  of tongue squamous  cell carcinoma,  possibly  with neck dissection  at the 
discretion  of the surgeon.    Patients  will be considered  done  with treatment at time of 
surgery or research biopsy.   As such, the surgical  or biopsy  procedure  is considered  
off-protocol,  and the surgery  or research  biopsy  will be performe d at the discretion  of 
the investigator.  The protocol  provides  no guidance  nor places  any restrictions  
regarding  surgical management.  
 
While  every attempt  will be made  to schedule  surgery  or research  biopsy  on Day 15, 
the exact timing  of surgery  or research  biopsy will be at the discretion  of the surgeon.  
No ribavirin  will be given  after surgery  or research biopsy.  
 
• Post-operative  (or post research  biopsy)  management will be per standard  of care,  off 
protocol.

IRB#: 10-218 A(8)  
 11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
This section  provides  guidelines  for the clinical management of adverse  events.  The 
toxicities  of ribavirin  are presented  in Section  5, and are listed  again  here:  
 
Hematologic:   anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,  lymphopenia  
Gastrointestinal:   anorexia,  nausea,  diarrhea  
Hepatic:   elevated  liver function  tests  
Pulmonary:   dyspnea, cough  
Reproductive:   may be teratogen  
Constitutional:  fatigue,  musculoskeletal  pain 
Dermatologic:  alopecia, pruritis, rash  
Neurologic:   headache,  dizziness  
Endocrine  and metabolic:   hyperuricemia  
 
 
Reporting  requirements  for adverse  events  are presented  in Section  17.2.  
 
All toxicities  will be assessed  according  to CTC version  4.  Dose  reductions  or drug stoppage  
are only required  for those  adverse  events  that the investigator feels  are possibly,  probably,  
or definitely  related  to ribavirin.  
 
Subjects who take < 10 days  of ribavirin  prior to surgery will be considered  inevaluable  and 
will be replaced.  
 
Any patient  who requires  dose  reduction  below  600 mg/day  will be removed  from study.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_714543] common  toxicity  requiring  dose  reduction  for ribavirin  is anemia.  
 
For any patient who experiences  a fall in hemoglobin  of > 2 g/dL (from Day  1 value),  ribavirin  
dose  will be decreased to  600 mg/day  (200 mg qAM,  400 mg qPM).    Any patients  who 
develop  a hemoglobin  level of < 10 g/dL will be removed  from study.  
 
Any patient  who develops  a platelet  count  of < 100 K/mcL  will be removed  from study.  Any 
patient  who develops  an absolute  neutrophil  count  of <1.0 K/mcL  will be removed  from study.  
Dose  delays  and dose  reductions  are not required  for uncomplicated  leukopenia  or 
uncomplicated  lymphopenia.  
 
11.3 Non-Hematologic  Toxicity  
 
For any patient who develops  grade 2  toxicity  (felt to be  definitely,  probably,  or possibly  
related  to ribavirin),  the investigator may either (a)  reduce  the dose  of ribavirin  to 600  
mg/day,  or (2) remove  the patient  from study.   Any patient  who develops  toxicity  of grade  3 
or greater  will be removed  from study.  
 
Even  when  the patient meets  criteria for continued  treatment at full dose  per the protocol,  
the investigator retains  the discretion  to delay  treatment  and/or reduce  dose  (to 600

 mg/day)   if there  are safety  concerns  and/or  logistical issues.   Any dose  reductions  not 
specified  in the protocol  should  be discussed  with the principal  investigator . 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  objective  of this study  is based  on immunohistochemistry  (IHC),  not a 
therapeutic  or radiologic  outcome.  For details  regarding  IHC methods, see Section  9.2.   As 
a secondary endpoint,  we wish to explore  the feasibility  of using  pre and post treatment  
FDG -PET/CT  scans  to assess  the metabolic  effect  of ribavirin  in tonsillar  and/or base  of 
tongue  squamous  cell carcinoma.  
 
The volume(s) of interest (VOI)  from the MRI neck (or CT neck) images  will be matched  to 
the FDG PET/CT  images.   Matched  VOIs  will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_545998],  using  the attenuation -corrected  PET emission  images.  For semiquantitative  
analysis,  VOIs  are placed  over the areas  of focal FDG  uptake  in the neck  nodal  metastases.  
The intensity  of FDG uptake  in these  regions  is measured  using  the standardized  uptake  
value  (SUV),  normalized  to body  height.  The maximum  pi[INVESTIGATOR_545974].  The 
imaging  data initially  available  in units  of microcuries  per milliliter  per voxel  are decay  
corrected  to the time of injection  and converted  into SUV units (73). 
 
PET images  will be reconstructed  from the initial data  set using  iterative  reconstruction  
software  and will be reoriented  into transaxial,  coronal and  sagittal slices.  Attenuation  
corrected  scans  will be read. The images  will be reviewed  in all standard  planes  (3- 
dimensional computer display)  and a maximum  intensity  projection  (MIP)  image.   At least 2 
parameters will be investigated  as measures  of tumor response  to therapy: SUVmax  and 
SUVmean.  Changes  in these  parameters  between  the baseline  and follow up scans  will be 
used  as a measure  of effect  of study  drug.  The data analysis  equipment and  software  for 
nuclear  medicine  imaging  is continuously  changing  and evolving.  As new imaging  analysis  
methods  are developed, we will apply  those  that are  optimal  to the imaging  purpose.  
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
 
• Patients may be removed  from the study  for protocol  non-compliance.  
 
• If at any time the patient develops  unacceptable  toxicity  he/she  will be removed  from 
study.  
 
• Participants can be  removed  from the study  at any time if the study  doctor  feels  that it  is in 
their best interest to do  so.

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
The primary  endpoint  of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_545954] 2 weeks  
decreases  tumor expression  of phosphorylated  eIF4E  among  patients  with tonsillar  and/or  
base  of tongue  squamous  cell carcinomas  that expresses  phosphorylated  eIF4E.  
 
Decision  Rule:  We would  consider ribavirin  to be  interesting  for further  study in this patient  
population  if we observe  at least 4 patients  (among  7) in which  positive  baseline  expression  
of phosphorylated  eIF4E  becomes  negative  after ribavirin  treatment.  
 
Positive  phosphorylated  eIF4E overexpression  is defined  as ≥30%  of cells with cytoplasmic  
and/or nuclear staining  by [CONTACT_4658] (19, 24).  With this 30% cutoff, the probabilities  of observing  
at least [ADDRESS_714544]-treatment  eIF4E  expression  among  the 7 patients  
included  in the study  are listed  below:  
 
True  probability  that 
ribavirin  inhibits  eIF4E  
expression  Probability  of observing  the 
inhibition  in at least 4 of the 7 
patients  
.40 .29 
.50 .52 
.60 .71 
.70 .87 
.80 .97 
 
 
For each  of the patients  tested, we will tabulate  pretreatment  and posttreatment tumor  
expression  of phosphorylated  eIF4E, of molecules  that are regulated  by [CONTACT_329240]4E  (p16, p21,  
EGFR), HPV -16 oncoproteins  (E6 and E7) and FDG-PET/CT  scans,  as well as percentage  
change  between  pretreatment and  posttreatment  levels.  
 
Toxicity  data (AEs,  laboratory  data and vital sign  data)  will be collected  and listed  individually  
per patient  according  to CTCAE  version  4.0. 
 
Subjects who take < 10 days  of ribavirin  prior to surgery  (or research  biopsy)  will be 
considered  inevaluable  and will be replaced.  The expected  accrual  rate is [ADDRESS_714545]  the study  to be completed  in 4 to 7 months.  
 
Note:   If the post-treatment tumor  specimen  cannot  be obtained  (eg, technical issues  or 
patient  withdraws  consent)  or if insufficient/inadequate  material is  available  for 
immunostaining  of phosphorylated  eIF4E, the subject  will be deemed  inevaluable  and will 
be replaced.  If there  is insufficient/inadequate  tissue  to perform the other  immunostains  discussed  
in the secondary  aims, this would  not be considered  a protocol  violation  and the  subject  would  
not need  to be replaced  as long as the patient was evaluable  for the primary  endpoint  of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].

verbal script/RA,  a completed  Eligibility  Checklist  and other relevant  documents  must  be 
uploaded  via the PPR Electronic Registration  System.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research  Study  Assistant (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the 
RSA include  project compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  
regulatory  monitoring, problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of 
the protocol  study  team.   The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  
database.   Source  documentation  will be available  to support the computerized  patient  
record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient accruals  and completeness  
of registration  data.   Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will 
be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential problems  will be brought  
to the attention  of the study team for discussion  and action.  
 
16.3 Data and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_28642] 2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data  and Safety Monitoring  of Clinical Trials”  which  can be  found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_28644].  The MSKCC  Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be  found  on the MSKCC  Intranet at:   
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/_assets/_tables/content/359709/DSMPlans07.pdf  
 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by [CONTACT_28645], safety  
and quality.   There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

 monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits, therapeutic  response, and  staff 
education  on clinical research  QA) and  departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional committees  that are  responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical trials  programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and  review  process,  each  protocol  is assessed  for it’s level 
of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every type  of protocol (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in- 
house  sponsored, industrial sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group, etc.)  will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Inclusion  of Children  in Research  
 
This protocol/project  does not include  children  because  the number of children  is limited  and 
because  the majority  are already  accessed  by a nationwide  pediatric  cancer  research  
network.  This statement is  based on exclusion  4b of the NIH Policy  and Guidelines  on the  
Inclusion  of Children  as Participants in  Research  Involving  Human  Subjects.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use  and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form. The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097] [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
 
17.2 Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) Reporting  
 
Any SAE must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  as soon  as possible  but no later than  5 calendar  days. The  
IRB/PB  requires  a Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  electronically  to the 
SAE Office  at [EMAIL_203] containing  the following  information:

17.3 Risks,  Benefits, Toxicities/side  effects  
Potential risks  to human  subjects  include  drug related  toxicity,  pain and discomfort  
associated  with ribavrin  side effects  (Section  5 and Section  11), phlebotomy,  and possible  
psychological discomfort  from the stresses  associated  with obtaining  imaging  studies.  There  
also is a small  potential risk  associated  with low-level radiation  exposure  from the research  
FDG  PET-CT scan in this study.   All efforts  will be made  to avoid  any complication  by 
[CONTACT_28646]’  symptoms, providing  appropriate management,  and 
monitoring  blood  tests.  
 
For patients  who undergo  research  biopsy, this  may be associated  with discomfort at the 
biopsy  site and minor  bleeding  or infection  at the biopsy  site. 
 
If an adverse  medical event  occurs, the patient will first contact [CONTACT_545999].   At nights  and on weekends, there  is an oncology  physician  on call at 
all times.   Patients  may either  call or come  directly  to the urgent  care center  at Memorial  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (or to their local emergency  room) to be  seen.  Patients suffering  serious  adverse  
reactions  must  be carefully  followed  and all follow -up information  also recorded.  
 
17.4 Alternatives/op tions  
Participation  in this trial is voluntary.   Patients  may opt not to participate  in this study  prior to  
the planned  surgery.  
 
 
17.5 Financial  Costs/Burdens  
The patient will be responsible  for all costs  related  to treatment and  complications  of 
treatment.  Costs  to the patient (third  party  insurer)  will include  the costs routine  blood  tests  
and diagnostic  studies, office  visits, baseline  EKG,  doctor’s  fees, and any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Patients  will not be charged  for any research  tests performed  on research  specimens.  
Ribavirin  is purchased  with Head  and Neck  DMT  research  funds  and with not billable  to 
research  participants.   Post-treatment  FDG PET-CT scan, if obtained, is  paid for Head  and 
Neck  DMT  research  funds  and is not billable  to research  participants.

1. BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
Psoriasis is a common T -helper cell type 1 (Th1) and type 17 (Th17) mediated inflammatory disease, 
affecting 2 -3% of the population.1-[ADDRESS_71613] array 
of therapeutic options, about 70% of patients with severe psoriasis affecting ≥10% body surface area (BSA) 
are not receiving treatment to control their disease.5 It is now increasingly recognized that psoriasis, like 
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, is a systemic inflammatory disorder and not only a 
disorder limited to the skin.6 In support of this, increasing evidence identifies psoriasis, particularly severe 
disease, as an independent risk factor for diabetes mellitus, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
cardiovascular (CV) mortality.7-20 
 
The pathoph ysiology of psoriasis is characterized by [CONTACT_65784] -regulation of Th1/Th17 cytokines. Serum levels of inflammatory markers, 
including C -reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) -6, IL-18, IL -12, IL -[ADDRESS_71614] activation of TNF -
α and IL -6 is foll owed by a systemic insulin -resistant state, metabolic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_65761] -
density lipoprotein (HDL) function.[ADDRESS_71615] been shown in 
patients with psoriasis: 1) Pro -atherogenic lipoprotein profiles (reduced HDL, elevated triglycerides, and 
increased small dense low -densit y lipoprotein particles),42,43 2) impaired macrophage cholesterol efflux and 
reverse cholesterol transport,44,45 and 3) inflammation -induced adipose and metabolic dysfunction (increase 
in leptin and insulin, and decrease in adiponectin).41,46 These data suggested potential biologic links to 
vascular inflammation and accelerated CV disease development.  
 
An in novative method to investigate the systemic inflammatory burden of psoriasis is with [18F] -
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT). FDG -PET/CT 
is a validated imaging technique that enables highly sensitive and p recise measurements of inflammation 
in vivo .47 FDG uptake in arterial walls reflects metabolic activity of inflammatory cells, particularly 
macrophages, within atherosclerotic lesions.48 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , it was observed that psoriasis is associated 
not only with clinically observed inflammation in the skin, but also foci of subclinical inflammation within the 
liver, joints, tendons, and aorta that were not explained by [CONTACT_65785] -
morbidities.49 Moreover, increasing severity of skin disease in psoriasis is associated with increasing 
severity of aortic vascular inflammation50. Since vascular inflammation on FDG -PET/CT strongly predicts 
future major vascular events and is responsive to even short term interventions for traditional CV risk 
factors,  51-55 it may also serve as a useful marker for evaluating vascular inflammation an d, thus, 
cardiovascular risk in response to psoriasis treatments.  
 
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP) is a key modulator of immune cell responses and is 
predominantly regulated by [CONTACT_65786] 4 (PDE4). Apremilast is  an oral  selective PDE4  inhibito r 
that is FDA approved for the treatment of psoriasis (see section 1.2) . PDE4 inhibition down -regulates  the 
inflammatory response by [CONTACT_65787] (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) -23, and 
other pro -inflammatory cytokines, while increasing anti -inflammatory cytokines, such as IL -1056,57.  cAMP 
also plays an important role in regul ation of macrophage inflammatory responses , and PDE4 inhibition has 
been shown to dramatically decrease the inflammatory response of macrophages58. 
 
Macrophages play an im portant role  in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, contributing at all stages59. 
Macrophages ingest lipoproteins, transforming them into cholesterol -laden foam cells. T hese foam cells

and cardiometabolic biomarkers in patients  with moderate to severe psoriasis.  In addition, metabolic 
syndrome and obesity are highly prevalent in psoriasis and it is therefore of special interest that in the phase 
III clinical trials for  apremilast, 20.2% of patients had weight loss, not associated with gastrointestinal side 
effects62. Because of this, the above CT imaging will also be used to measure changes in abdominal fat 
composition in patients taking apremilast.  
1.[ADDRESS_71617] : Apremilast   
Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. Apremilast is known chemically as N -[2-[(1S) -1-(3-
ethoxy -4-methoxyphenyl) -2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl] -2,3-dihydro -1,3-dioxo -1H-isoindol -4-yl]acetamide. Its 
empi [INVESTIGATOR_24598] C22H24N2O7S and the molecular weight is 460.5  g/mol . Each tablet contains 
apremilast as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium. Apremilast is an oral small -molecule 
inhibitor of PDE4  specific for cyclic  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in 
increased intracellular cAMP levels. The specific mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_65788] .

Maxim um Recommended Human Dose (MRHD)  on an  AUC basis (1000 mg/kg/day) or in rats at oral 
doses up to approximately 0.08 - and 1.1 -times the MRHD, (20 mg/kg/day in males and 3 mg/kg/day in 
females, respectively).  
 
Apremilast tested negative in the Ames assay, in vitro chromosome aberration assay of human peripheral 
blood lymphocytes, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .  
 
In a fertility study of male mice, apremilast at oral doses up to approximately 3 -times the MRHD based on 
AUC (up to 50 mg/kg/day) produced no effects on male fertility. In a f ertility study of female mice, 
apremilast was administered at oral doses of 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg/day. At doses ≥1.8 -times the MRHD 
(≥20 mg/kg/day), estrous cycles were prolonged, due to lengthening of diestrus which resulted in a longer 
interval until m ating. Mice that became pregnant at doses of 20 mg/kg/day and greater also had 
increased incidences of early post -implantation losses. There was no effect of apremilast approximately 
1.3-times the MRHD (10 mg/kg/day) .  
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
1.4.1  Human Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption:  Apremilast , when taken orally , is absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of ~73%, with 
peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occurring at a median time (tmax) of ~2.[ADDRESS_71619].  
 
Distribution:  Human plasma protein binding of apremilast is approximately 68%. Mean appa rent volume 
of distribution  is 87 L.  
 
Metabolism : Following oral administration in humans, apremilast is a major circulating component (45%) 
followed by [CONTACT_65789] M12 (39%), a glucuronide conjugate of O -demethylated apremilast. It is 
extensively metabolized in humans with up to [ADDRESS_71620] is metabolized by [CONTACT_65790] (CYP) oxidative metabolism with subsequent 
glucuronidation and non -CYP mediated hydrolysis. In vitro, CYP metabolism of apremilast is primarily 
mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with min or contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2A6.

Elimination : The plasma clearance of apremilast is about 10 L/hr in healthy subjects, with a terminal 
elimination half -life of approximately [ADDRESS_71621], 
about 58% and 39% of the radioactivity is recovered in urine and feces, respectively, with about 3% and 
7% of the radioactive dose recovered as apremilast in urine and feces, respectively . 
1.4.2  Clinical Studies in Adults  
Two multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials (Studies PSOR -1 and PSOR -2) 
enrolled a total of 1257 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
[body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥10%, Physician Gl obal Assessment (PGA) of ≥3 (moderate or 
severe disease), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12, candidates for phototherapy or 
systemic therapy]. Subjects were allowed to use low -potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_65762], axilla 
and groin. Subjects with scalp psoriasis were allowed to use coal tar shampoo and/or salicylic acid scalp 
preparations on scalp lesions.  
 
Study PSOR -1 enrolled 844 subjects and Study PSOR -2 enrolled 413 subjects. In both studies, subjects 
were randomized 2:[ADDRESS_71622] 30 mg BID or placebo for 16 weeks. Both studies assessed the 
proportion of subjects who achieved PASI -75 at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects who achieved a 
PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at Week 16. Across both studies, subjects ra nged in age from 
18 to 83 years, with an overall median age of 46 years. The mean baseline BSA involvement was 25.19% 
(median 21.0%), the mean baseline PASI score was 19.07 (median 16.80), and the proportion of subjects 
with PGA score of 3 (moderate) and 4  (severe) at baseline were 70.0% and 29.8%, respectively. 
Approximately 30% of all subjects had received prior phototherapy and 54% had received prior 
conventional systemic and/or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis with 37% receiving prior 
conventional systemic therapy and 30% receiving prior biologic therapy. Approximately one -third of 
subjects had not received prior phototherapy, conventional systemic nor biologic therapy. A total of 18% 
of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis.  
 
The proportion of subjects who achieved PASI -75 responses, and PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear 
(1), are presented in Table 1.  The median time to loss of PASI -75 response among the subjects re -
randomized to placebo at Week 32 during the Randomized Trea tment Withdrawal Phase was 5.1 weeks

investigators  or designated research personnel . Psoriasis severity will be assessed using the Psoriasis 
Area and Sever ity Index (PASI) and the Physician Global Assessment (PGA), both widely accepted 
measurement tools for psoriasis63.  The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) will also be measured to 
collect informa tion regarding patient -oriented outcomes64, 65. 
 
FDG -PET/CT will be conducted at baseline , week 16  and week 52 . Subjects will undergo a FDG -PET/CT 
scan using the standard protocol as described below.   Subjects will be required to fast for 8 hours prior to 
the scan. At the imagin g center, finger -stick ser um glucose levels will be checked to ensure a glucose 
level <150 mg/dL prior to FDG administration. If the glucose level exceeds 150 mg/dL, consultation with 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_65763]. Neck to iliac crests  PET/CT image acquisition will begin about 120 minutes (± 10 
minutes) after IV administration of 15 mCi of [18F] -FDG  or other appropriate weight -based dose per 
imaging site’s standard dosing protocol . Axial, sagittal, and coronal PET reconstructions will be 
interpreted with and without attenuation correction, using non -contrast CT images for anatomical 
correlation. Within approximately 24 hours after the completion of the FDG -PET/CT scan, the local 
nuclear medicine personnel will issue a clinical report determining if the subject has any clinically 
significant findings which could preclude the subject’s continued participation in the study.  
 
The arterial uptake of FDG will be measured by [CONTACT_65792] (SUV) divided 
by [CONTACT_65793] , a previously reported method for quantifying vascular inflammation65. This will 
yield a maximum target to background ratio (TBR max) which is considered the standard reporting variable 
in FDG -PET/CT vascular studies66. The PET/CT images obtained from each site’s local imaging center 
will be de -identified and sent to the University of Pennsylvania Imaging Lab where trained nuclear 
medicine personnel will undertake a qualitative review of the PET/C T images. During this review, two -
dimensional (2D) circular regions of interests (ROIs) will be manually placed on the PET images around 
the external aortic contour, around the hepatic margin, and around articular spaces on all transverse 
slices passing th rough these structures using low -dose CT images for anatomic guidance. The images 
will then be sent to the central core National Institutes of Health (NIH) Imaging Lab for measuring the 
SUVs. The NIH central PET/CT readers will be blinded to time  point of scan  via Digital Imaging and 
Communication in Medicine (DICOM) file editing applied by [CONTACT_3374].  
 
In addition to the mean SUV of the whole aorta, mean SUV s will be calculated for five segments of the 
aorta: ascending aorta, aortic arc h, descending thoracic aorta, suprarenal abdominal aorta, and infrarenal 
abdominal aorta. These segments are defined to consider separately various regions of aortic disease 
that are associated with different clinical phenotypes (e.g., aortic arch disease with stroke, abdominal 
aortic disease with abdominal aortic aneurysm)  48,49,6 6,67,68. 
 
Adipose tissue volumes will be  assessed at L2 –L3 using automated  software , as has been previously 
reported69. The algorithm will consist  of body masking, noise  reduction, adipose tissue labeling, viscera l 
adipose tissue ( VAT) and subcu taneous adipose tissue  (SAT) separation,  and quantitation. The adipose 
tissue volume  inside the internal contour contributes to the VAT and  the adipose tissue volume between 
the external contour and  internal contour contributes to SAT.  
 
Laboratory tests will be conducted at screening, baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12 , 16 and 52 . This includes 
labs for screening safety and cardiometabolic biomarkers . Blood will be coll ected as described in 
Appendix E. In summary, a  total volume of 30 mL (34.5 mL for Penn participants at Week 0 and Week 16 
only)  will be drawn per patient. Tubes will be labeled with an ID that does not contain identifiable 
personal information. The date and time of sample collection will be also indicated on a lab transfer sheet. 
Tubes will be sent directly to a lab at the NIH where the samples will be processed and stored.  
 
The blood will be used for making aliquots of plasma and serum for storage at -80° C after centrifugation 
of sample s for 20 minutes at 2,400 RPM.  Any remaining plasma and/or serum will be destroyed at the 
completion of the study , except as required for quality  assurance .  All samples are run in duplicate and 
normalized to a control pooled sample run simultaneously.

The expected duration of this open -label trial for each participant is 52 weeks, in addition, to an initial 
screening visit and screening period of up to 30 days. 
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Before subjects may be screened for enrollment into this study, full IRB approval of the protocol and 
consent will be obtained. Subjects will be provided with the approved informed consent form and 
complete the informed consent process according to FDA regulations and Good Clinical P ractice  
guidelines prior to any study related procedures.  Upon signing consent, subjects will be screened to 
determine their eligibility for the study (see sections 4.1 and 4.2).   
 
Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo a screening assessment within 30 
days of study enrollment. This includes a complete medical history and physical exam; vital signs and 
weight; routine blood work ( CBC, CMP) , HIV, hepatitis  B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibodies, and  
urine  pregnancy test . Details of the screening procedures can be found in Section 6.2. If a subject reports 
current use of a psoriasis therapy at time of screening assessment, the study physician will determi ne, 
based on psoriasis severity and overall medical history, whether the subject can undergo a washout 
period.  The subject will then be informed of what to expect during a washout period and will be asked to 
decide whether they would like to continue with  the study.  If the subject decides to continue, he/she will 
be monitored for AEs during the washout period and routine blood work will be repeated for subjects who 
complete a washout period of greater than 30 days.  Subjects who complete all screening vis it 
procedures and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo baseline FDG -PET/CT and 
cardiometabolic assessments. If screening assessment exceeds [ADDRESS_71629] can continue with baseline visit procedures.   
 
Administrati on of the initial dose of study treatment (apremilast ) must occur 7 days or less from date of 
FDG -PET/CT scan . If initial dose cannot occur within 7 days of FDG -PET/CT scan, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_65764].

At weeks 4, 8, 12 , 16, 28, 40 and 52 , subjects will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65794] . Psoriasis severity will be assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and the 
Physician Global Assessment (PGA).  Laboratory tests will also be conducted at baseline  and weeks 4, 8, 
12, 16, and 52  for screening safety labs and/or cardiomet abolic biomarker assessment.  FDG -PET/CT will 
be conducted at baseline , week 16  and week 52 .

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoints to be measured in this study include:  
 Change in total vascular inflammation of the  whole  aorta as assessed on FDG -PET/CT between 
baseline and week 16  
 Change in cardiometabolic biomarkers  between baseline and week 16    
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The s econdary e ndpoints to be measured in the study include:  
Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis - Apremilast (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  22 
 Change in total vascular inflammation of the five aortic segments  as assessed on FDG -PET/ CT 
between baseline and week 16, and between baseline and week 52   
 Change in cardiometabolic biomarkers at week 4, 8, 12 , 16 and 52 compared to baseline and 
earlier time points  
 Change in total vascular inflammation of the aorta as assessed on FDG -PET/CT between week 
52 and earlier time points (baseline and week 16)  
 Changes in body composition as measured on FDG -PET/CT between week 52 and earlier time 
points (baseline and week 16)  
 Changes in physician reported outcomes (PASI, PGA)  
 Changes in the patient reported outcomes  (DLQI , pruritus VAS ) 
 Safety endpoints  
 
7.3 Sample Size and Power Determination  
The sample size is based on primary and secondary outcome of changes in tissue -to-background ratio 
(TBR) of the standardized uptake values (SUV) of the tracer measured by [CONTACT_6789] -PET/CT.  Using a two 
sided test with alpha=0.[ADDRESS_71654] deviation (SD) estimate of the change in TBR (SD=0.263), 
35 patients will provide 90% power to detect a clinically significant change of 0. [ADDRESS_71655] treatment measurements.  The 3 5 patients will also provide 90% power to detect clinically relevant 
differences in biomarkers between pre- and post -treatment  of approximately 0. 57 SD, well below the 
general threshold for significance of one SD.  To accommodate potential dropout of up to 50% at 52 
weeks , we intend to accrue 70 patients.  However, at 16 weeks w e assume our dropout rate will only be 
20%.  Assuming [ADDRESS_71656] a FDG -PET/CT at [ADDRESS_71657] 98.7% power to detect 
the 0.15 change in TBR as discussed above.  
7.4 Statistical Methods  
Stata 14 .0 or a more current version (StataCorp, College Station, TX) will be used for all analyses. All data 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, range for continuous variables; frequencies for 
categorical variables) and graphical techniques  (histograms, scatterplots). Tables will be produced 
describing any missing data patterns due to either withdrawal or other reasons.   
 
Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis will consist of  comparisons of total vascular inflammation of the aorta  and 
cardi ometabolic biomarkers  between week [ADDRESS_71658] completed both the baseline and 
week 16  FDG -PET/CT scan s, regardless of their level of adherence to apremilast .   
 
Secondary Analysis  
Secondary analyses will include comparisons in total vascular inflammation of the aorta  and its five 
segments , change in cardiometabolic biomarkers and change in body composition between week s 52,  [ADDRESS_71659] (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  [ADDRESS_71660] Population(s) for Analysis  
Primary  analyses will be conducted according to the intention -to-treat principle, including all people who 
enrolled in the study and completed an FDG -PET/CT scan at week [ADDRESS_71661] 90% 
adherent with apremilast dosing . 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions   
8.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence occurring at any 
dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent 
illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless  of etiology. Any medical 
condition that was present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved should not 
be recorded as an AE. If there is a worsening of that medical condition , this should be considered an AE. 
A diagnosis or syndrom e should be recorded on the AE page of the Case Report Form rather than the 
individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome.   All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_3786](s) from the time of signing the informed consent through the end of the des ignated follow -up 
period.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events:  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE  if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by 
[CONTACT_39132]:  
 Results in discontinuation from the study.  
 Requires treatment, modification/interruption of study drug dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention.  
 Is judged by [CONTACT_737](s) to be of significant clinical importance.  
 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, th en only the diagnosis or 
syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis 
or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE.  
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689](s) the subject is at immediate risk of 
death from the AE)  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent o r significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Constitutes an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life threatening 
or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or 
Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis - Apremilast (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  24 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.  
 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65777]: were planned before entry into the clinical 
study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the stu died indication or its treatment; occur 
on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless fulfilling other criteria above); 
are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied indication and are not associated with any 
deter ioration in condition.  
 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be 
completed.  
 
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, relationship to 
study drug, actio n taken regarding study drug, and outcome.  
8.[ADDRESS_71662] has completed his/her participation in the study. A serious adverse event must be reported if it 
occurs during a subject’s participation in the  study and/or within [ADDRESS_71663] completes his/her participation in the Study 
must be followed until any of the following occurs:  
 The event resolves or stabilizes;  
 The event returns to baseline condition or value (if a baseline value is available);  
 The event can be attributed to agents(s) other than the Study Product, or to factors unrelated to 
Study conduct.  
 
Any subsequent AE felt to be causally related  to the use of the study product should be reported.  
8.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administration of study drug and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as not suspected or suspected as defined below:  
 
Not suspected : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or remote , or 
other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the ob served event  
 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible,  and other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation f or the observed event.  
 
8.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events:  
Any AE that meets any criterion for a SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to 
being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is required to ensure that the data on 
these forms is accurate and consistent.  This appl ies to all SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, 
that occur after informed consent has been obtained , those made known to the Investigator(s) within [ADDRESS_71664]’s last dose of study drug, and those made known to the investigator(s) at  any time  
that are suspected of being related to study drug.  
 
Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis - Apremilast (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  [ADDRESS_71665] be reported immediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Principal Investigators’ knowledge of 
the event) to [COMPANY_010]  Safety by [CONTACT_6972]  (see below for contact [CONTACT_3031]) .  A w ritten report, prepared by 
[CONTACT_17210]-site Investigator or Penn Principal Investigator(s) using an SAE Report Form or a 3500A 
Medwatch form , is to be faxed to [COMPANY_010]  Safety (see below for contact [CONTACT_3031]).   
 
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE.  If a subject has died and an autopsy 
has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_65778].  Any follow -up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form or 
Medwatch form and sent to [COMPANY_010]  Safety. 
 
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) 
of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up information about the event. The 
Investigator(s) must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_65779], including correspondence with [COMPANY_010]  and the 
IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the 
study must be followed until either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/resolves with  sequelae, or 
returns to baseline (if a baseline value is available).  
 
Pregnancies :  
When a female subject of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant 
changes at the time of study entry or at any time during the study, the Investigator will educate the subject 
regarding options and correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to 
successfully prevent pregnancy.  
 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless  of age or 
disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the subject is on 
study drug, or within [ADDRESS_71666]’s last dose of study drug, are considered immediately 
reportable events.  Study drug is to be discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any 
unused portion of the study drug to the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to [COMPANY_010]  Safety immediately facsimile (see below for contact 
[CONTACT_3031] ) using the Pregnancy Report form provided by [CONTACT_11337] . 
 
The female should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for 
further evaluation and counseling.  
 
The Investigator(s) will follow the fema le subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify 
[COMPANY_010]  Safety of the outcome of the pregnancy as a follow -up on the follow up Pregnancy Reporting 
form.  
 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE ( i.e., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus]), the 
Investigator(s) should follow the procedures f or reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event to [COMPANY_010]  Safety by 
[CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  In the case of a live “normal” birth, 
[COMPANY_010]  Safety should be advised by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_71667] to causality, as 
SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 d ays that the Investigator(s) suspects is related to the in 
utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to [COMPANY_010]  Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of 
the Investigators’ knowledge of the event.  
 
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any d etermination regarding the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be determined by [CONTACT_737](s) and the [COMPANY_010]  Medical Monitor.  
Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis - Apremilast (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  26 
 
Overdose : 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an  
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be  
reported as an AE.  Any sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product 
should be reported as an AE.  
 
If the sequela of an overdos e is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on  
an SAE report form. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of the event on 
the SAE report form but should not be reported as an SAE itself.  
 
In the event of an overdose, the sub ject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive  
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for apremilast overdose.  
Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and  
experien ce of the treating physician.  
 
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of any more than the amount 
prescribed of apremilast tablets in any 24 hour period whether by [CONTACT_65802].  
 
8.4.1  Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) s hould be submitted to  [COMPANY_010]  Safety and the  
IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE s are followed until either resolved or stable.  
8.4.2  Investigator reporting: notifying [COMPANY_010]  
 
 [COMPANY_010] should receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_65780], or any other regulatory 
agency, IRB or IEC, within 24 hours of such submission. Such notifications should be submitted as 
E2B, MedWatch or CIOMS I reports using the enclosed ISS Safety  Fax Transmittal Cover Sheet and 
faxed to 888 -814-8653.   
  
Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB  
The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those events related to 
study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of 
harm.  The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not 
meet the all of the following criteria : 
 Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) given (a)the research procedure 
described in this protocol and the informed consent document and (b) the ch aracteristics of the 
population being studied  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or other at a greater risk of harm (physical, 
psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously  known or recognized    
 
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the Penn 
IRB via the HS -ERA online system (including a description of the event with information regarding its 
fulfillment of the above cr iteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other 
study documentation)  within 10 working days from the time the Investigator becomes aware of the event.   
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28693]’s study file.  
 
Reporting Deaths :   
Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis - Apremilast (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  27 
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes the more 
rapid reporting requirement of the Penn IRB for specific situations:  
 Report th e event within 24 hours  when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and indicates 
participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  
 Report the event within 72 hours,  for all other deaths, regardless of whether the death is related to 
study participation.  
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the Penn IRB may be made by [CONTACT_65803]. The SAE report can follow via the HS -ERA online system.   
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following ev ents are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected 
adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic 
necrosis, Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause [COMPANY_010]  to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or 
informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_65804].  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or p otential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device,  or biologic used in a 
research protocol.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and 
the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot 
be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
8.[ADDRESS_71668] treatment will be used to ensure primary safety endpoints outlined in Section 3.2. Subjects will 
be monitored for adverse events and serious adverse events by [CONTACT_65805]. 
Subjects who experience adverse events may be removed from study participation at the discretion of the 
Investigator . 
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investig ator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above.  Medical monitoring will include regular assessments of the number and type of adve rse and 
serious adverse events as well as implementation of a Data and Sa fety Monitoring Plan (Appendix F).     
8.6.[ADDRESS_71669] (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  [ADDRESS_71670] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What p rotected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization  to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
 
The study will  take the following precautionary measures to protect subjects’  privacy and the 
confidentiality of research and/or medical records. Research records are kept in offices that are locked, 
only accessible by [CONTACT_464].   Computerized records are entered only with subject ID, are kept in 
databases on institution ally secure servers and managed network drives maintained and backed -up on a 
regular basis, protected using firewall technologies, and restricted  to individuals authorized to work on the 
study  with regular monitoring for unauthorized access and other poten tial security and operational events .  
External laboratories that will analyze biologic samples from this study will not receive information that 
could identify the subject. These laboratories will only receive a number to identify the samples. It is a 
requirement that subjects involvement in the study be noted in his/her medical records. Medical records 
also include electronic medical records or EMR. If a subject ’s primary care physician is different from the 
study doctor for this study, he/she may also be  notified. Medical records may also be reviewed and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_65781]/independent ethics committee 
responsible for this trial site, or a regulatory agency. These individuals will see subjects name, other 
person al information such as date of birth and gender, and medical information, but shall not disclose this 
information to anyone else. At the conclusion of the data collection phase of the study, de -identified data 
sets will be prepared for analyses purposes.  Only the study data manager will retain the ability to re -
identify data, if needed for AE reporting or medical monitoring.  
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_65806] R eport 
Forms (CRF ) using fully validated software that conforms to US [ADDRESS_71671] in the study .  Source data is 
all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial 
necessary for the recons truction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluatio n checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_14848], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic 
media, x -rays, subject fil es, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -
technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 Electronic study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  If 
data is recorded directly o n the CRF (i.e. no prior written or electronic record of data), the CRF is to be 
considered the source data (per ICH GCP Section 6.4.9).  All data requested on the CRF must be 
Vascular Inflammation in Psoriasis - Apremilast (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  [ADDRESS_71672] (A 
signed co py is given to the subject).  
9.3 Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least 2 years after the final 
study results are presented in a public forum.   These documents should be retained for a longer  period if 
required by [CONTACT_65807] .  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of [COMPANY_010]  to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Auditing and  Inspecting  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, [COMPANY_010] , 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, reg ulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.). The Investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an Investigator in this stu dy implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA 
Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly cons tituted i ndependent Ethics 
Committee  (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal 
approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to  the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to [COMPANY_010]  before 
commencement of this study.  The investigator should keep  a list of EC/IRB members and their affiliate 
on file . 
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participatio n in this study.  (See 
Appendix B for a copy of the Subject Informed Consent Form. ) This consent form will be submitted with 
the pr otocol for review and approva l by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study. The formal consent of a subject, using 
the EC/IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study 
procedure.  The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_65808], and the 
investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent.   
11.[ADDRESS_71673] (VIP -A)                                                                Page:  [ADDRESS_71674] Benefits : Potential benefits for study participation include comprehensive laboratory safety tests  
and FDG -PET/CT assessment at no cost, the results of which will be reviewed with each subject and that 
can be brought to each subject’s medical provider(s) for optim ization and management of their CV risk. 
Subjects will receive apremilast, an FDA -approved psoriasis treatment with substantial efficacy and 
established safety profile, at no cost for [ADDRESS_71675] Benefits:  Data derived from this study will provide  critical information on the impact of apremilast 
on vascular inflammation cardiometabolic function  and body composition . 
11.[ADDRESS_71676] that the risks of the research study are outweighed by [CONTACT_65809] .   
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where required by 
[CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing so, after such consent 
has been provided by a legally acceptable representative(s) of the subject. In cases where the subject’s 
representative gives consent, the subject should be informed about the study to the extent possible given 
his/her understanding.  If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_65810] a separate assent form. Informed consent

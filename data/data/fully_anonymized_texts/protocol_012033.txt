13 GDD-TA-T-004 v2015.101. Background and Clinical Rationale
What is Migraine and How Prevalent is It?
Migraine affects 18% of women and 6% of men in the [LOCATION_002] with a peak prevalence 
occurring between the ages of [ADDRESS_646708] during an attack ( Lipton 2007 ). In the [LOCATION_002], work loss due to migraine is 
estimated to cost ~$13 billion annually  (Hu 1999). Prevalence is similar in Europe, with 
migraine headache affecting 17.6% of women and 8% of men ( Stovner 2010
). It is currentl y 
ranked by [CONTACT_265012] 19th among causes of disability (Katsarava 
2012). 
Migraine is typi[INVESTIGATOR_502149], unilateral headache of moderate 
or severe pain intensity, associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity  to light 
(photophobia) and sound (phonophobia). In about 25% of individuals, migraine headache 
may be preceded b y focal neurological dy sfunction (aura). Improving the diagnosis and 
optimizing treatments for migraine have been recognized as critically  important to reduce the 
global burden of migraine ( Katsarava 2012 ).
Because there are no biological markers for migraine, diagnosis is based on clinical history , 
examination, and the exclusion of other headache disorders. Phy sicians apply  clinical criteria 
to guide diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_72436] a syndrome diagnosis 
applied to patients with migraine (with or without aura) who have [ADDRESS_646709] edition beta version (ICHD -3 beta) diagn osis applied to a subset of patients with 
≥ 15 headache day s per month ( ICHD-3 beta 2013 ; Katsarava 2012; Olesen 2006 ). 
What is CGRP and Its Relationship to Migraine?
Calcitonin gene -related peptide ( CGRP)is a neuropeptide implicated in the pathophy siology 
of migraine. CGRP levels in the cranial venous outflow (ie, external jugular vein) are 
increased during a migraine attack ( Goadsby 1993) and exogenously  administered CGRP has 
been shown to trigger migraine -like headache in migraineurs. The majority  (80 to 90%) of 
trigeminal Aδ fibers that innervate the dura contain CGRP, suggesting that these fibers may  
be involved in sterile n eurogenic inflammation and migraine pain transmission. Furthermore, 
the CGRP receptor is present on human meningeal and cerebral blood vessels. These 
observations suggest that activation of the trigeminovascular system, with release of CGRP, 
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-04 Amendment 3
14 GDD-TA-T-004 v2015.10may play a keyrole in migraine pathogenesis and that inhibition of CGRP function may  yield 
a novel therapeutic approach to treating migraine.
Establishment of CGRP Antagonism to Treat Migraine
The ability  of CGRP antagonism to relieve pain in the acute treatment of mig raine was 
established by  [CONTACT_502157] (IV) formulation of olcegepant ( Olesen 2004), and 
replicated b y [COMPANY_006] & Co., I nc.,with an oral formulation of telcagepant, a highl y selective 
CGRP receptor antagonist (CGRP RA). I n Phase 3 studies, telcagepant was superior to 
placebo in the primary  endpoints of 2 -hour pain freedom, 2 -hour pain relief, and the absence 
of associated s ymptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), as well as the key  
secondary  endpoint of 24 -hour sustained pain freedom 
(SPF) (Connor 2009 ).Serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increases were observed with telcagepant, as well as with a second 
CGRP antagonist, MK -3207. For this reason, the development of these compounds was 
stopped. 
What is Ubrogepant?
Ubrogepant, a novel CGRP receptor antagonist that is chemicall y distinct from both 
telcagepant and MK -3207, is now being developed for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Preclinical and clinical studies conducted to date for ubrogepant have shown no evidence of 
hepatotoxicity.
A Phase 2b clinical stud y was conducted, which compared 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg doses of 
ubrogepant to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine. Overall, all the ubrogepant doses 
tested were well tolera ted and the adverse event (AE) profile of all ubrogepant doses did not 
differ significantl y from placebo. For the primary efficacy endpoint of pain freedom at 
2hours, ubrogepant doses of 1 and 10 mg did not differ from placebo, but doses of 25, 50, 
and 100mg were better than placebo. For the primary  efficacy endpoint of pain relief at 
2hours none of the ubrogepant doses differed from placebo, probabl y due to a high placebo 
response rate.
The absence of migraine -associated s ymptoms of photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea 
wereassessed as key  secondary  endpoints. Ubrogepant doses of 50 and 100 mg were 
significantl y better than placebo for absence of phonophobia and photophobia at 2 hours, 
whereas 25 mg did not differ from placebo. None of the ubrogepant dos es differed from 
placebo for the endpoint of absence of nausea at 2 hours. Measures of sustained migraine 
headache relief ( 2to 24 hours and 2 to 48 hours SPF and sustained pain relief) generall y 
suggested that ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg were more effective than the 25 mg dose.
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-04 Amendment 3
15 GDD-TA-T-004 v2015.10This trial is being conducted to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of ubrogepant 
for the acute treatment of migraine.
The purpose of including the usual -care arm will be to contextualize any  safety findings that 
may occur over the course of a y ear in the ubrogepant arms. In open- label designs without a 
comparator arm, it can be difficult to interpret any safet y findings that may arise in the 
experimental treatment arm. The proposed inclusion of the usual -care arm in this study is 
intended to address this limitation. Because of the stated purpose of the usual -care arm, 
efficacy data will not be collected from patients randomized to this arm.
2. Study Objectives and Clinical Hypotheses
2.1 Study Objectives
To evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of intermittent treatment with ubrogepant for the acute 
treatment of migraine over 1 year.
2.2 Clinical Hypothesis
Ubrogepant 50 and 100 mg is safe and tolerable for the acute treatment of migraine over 
1year.
3. Study Design
This multicenter, r andomized, open -label, 52- week extension study  will enroll approximately  
1200 patients from approximately  200 centers in the [LOCATION_002]. Patients will be 
randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups: usual care, ubrogepant 50 mg, 
or ubrogepant 100 mg (400 patients per arm). The study  is open-label; however, 
randomization to the ubrogepant arms (50 and 100 mg) will be blinded. If and when an 
interim analy sis occurs, the doses will be unblinded (see Section 7.6).
Patients randomized to either of the ubrogepant arms will treat up to 8 migraine attacks (of 
any pain severity ) per 4-weekperiodat home for a total of [ADDRESS_646710] dose. For detailed information on migraine treatment regimens, i ncluding 
optional second dose and rescue medication, see Section 5.6.
Patients randomized to the usual- care arm will be instructed to treat their migraine with 
medication(s) that they  routinely  use to relieve a migraine attack. Their usual medication(s) 
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-04 Amendment 3
16 GDD-TA-T-004 v2015.10for acute treatment will be identified at Visit 1 and any  changes throughout the study  will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
 
 
 
 
. 
The primary  outcome is safet y and tolerability. The planned safet y assessments include 
collection of AEs, clinical laboratory  determinations, ECGs, vital sign measurements, 
physical examinations, and the Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS). 
3.[ADDRESS_646711]-treatment elevations of ALT and/or aspartate aminotransfer ase (AST)≥ 3 times the 
upper limit of nor mal (ULN) in the ubrogepant program. The purpose of this committee 
charter will be to provide a standardized process for the adjudication of data associated with 
these events in order to determine whether the elevation was due to ubrogepant or not, and to 
determine whether there was a confounding factor. 
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board will also be established to review safet y data 
and summary  reports, identify  any safety issues and trends, and make recommendations to 
the Allergan, including mo dification or earl y termination of a trial, if emerging data show 
unexpected and clinically significant adverse effects of treatment.

6.2.7 Suicidality Assessment
The C-SSRS is a clinician -rated instrument that reports the severit y of both suicidal ideation 
and behavior. Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5 -item scale: Ty pe 1 (wish to be dead ), Type 
2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), Ty pe 3 (active suicidal ideation with any  methods 
[not plan] without intent to act), Ty pe 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, 
without specific plan), and Ty pe 5 (active suicidal ideation wi th specific plan and intent). The 
C-SSRS also captures information about the intensity of ideation, specifically  the frequency , 
duration, controllability , deterrents, and reasons for the most severe t ypes of ideation. 
Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5 -item scale: Ty pe 0 (no suicidal behavior), Ty pe 1 
(preparatory  acts or behavior), Ty pe 2 (aborted attempt), Ty pe 3 (interrupted attempt), and 
Type 4 (actual attempt). More than [ADDRESS_646725] recent attempts. The C -SSRS will be completed at all study  
visits. At all visits, the C -SSRS will be completed for ideation and behavior since th e 
previous visit. The C- SSRS will be completed on the eTablet b y the investigator or designee 
with current and valid training in administering the assessment. A patient should not be 
released from the study center until the results of C-SSRS are reviewed a nd it is confirmed 
that the patient is not considered to be at risk.
6.2.8 Cardiovascular Disease Risk
Patients will be classified to 1 of 3 coronary  heart disease risk categories (low, moderate, 
high) based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP; NIH Publication 
No.01-3670, 2001). 
Category 1 (High Risk): > 20% 10 -year cardiovascular (CV) risk 
Category 2 (Moderate Risk): 10 to 20% 10 -year CV risk 
Category 3 (Low Risk): < 10% 10- year CV risk
Risk of cardiovascular disease will be assessed in the lead -in studies using an algorithm 
based on NCEP and the Framingham risk factors ,along with the presence of cardiovascular 
heart disease or other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease, as well as diabetes.

8.5 Instructions for the Patients
Section 4.5.3provides diet and activity  instructions for patients enrolled in th e study. 
All patients will be instructed to use an electronic diary  (eDiary) to record details associated 
with their migraine attack. Training for the eDiary will be provided for qualified patients at 
Visit 2. Patients will be instructed to bring their eD iary to each clinic visit and for those who 
were dispensed ubrogepant, return their medication packs (used and unused).
8.6 Unscheduled Visits
Additional examinations and laboratory  assessments may  be performed as necessary  to 
ensure the safet y and well -being of the patients during the study  period. Unscheduled visit 
eCRFs should be completed for each unscheduled visit. For all parameters not measured, 
indicate “not done”.
8.7 Compliance with Pr otocol
All assessments will be conducted at the appropriate visits as o utlined in Table 1, and the 
timing of the visits should occur as close as possible to the specified day . At each visit, the 
patient will be asked if he or she c hangedthe dose/regimen of any  existing concomitant 
medications or initiated the use of an y new concomitant medications since the last visit, to 
ensure compliance with the protocol.
Patients will record the requested information regarding their migraine attack a nd ubrogepant 
taken in the eDiary . Ubrogepant compliance will be closel y monitored b y counting the

Protocol violation
Noncompliance with ubrogepant
Withdrawal of consent (a clear reason must be documented)
Lost to follow -up (every  effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_102]; a 
certified/traceable letter must be sent)
Lack of qua lifying event (a qualify ing migraine is not treated within 6 months)
Pregnancy
Other reasons
Patients may  voluntaril y withdraw from the stud y at any time. Notification of earl y patient 
discontinuation from the study and the reason for discontinuation will be made to Allergan 
and will be clearly documented on the appropriate eCRF. All randomized patients who 
prematurel y discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, should be seen for a final 
assessment. A final assessment will be defined as completion of the evaluations scheduled 
for Visit 15/ ET. If the patient discontinues prematurely, the patie nt is expected to return for a 
Safety Follow-up visit 4 weeks after Visit 15/ET.
8.9 Withdrawal Criteria
Women who become pregnant will be withdrawn from the study  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and 
should refrain from taking ubrogepant. The patient should return to the clinic for Visit 15/ET 
procedures.
Patients who meet IPdiscontinuation criteria related to abnorma l liver function tests 
(Section9.5) and who are advised not to be re -challenged will be withdrawn from the study .
Patients who reply  with “yes” to questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section or “y es” to 
any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C -SSRS should not receive an y further

(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. I n addition, during the screening period, AE s will be assessed 
regardless of the administration of a pharmaceutical produc t.
Note:  AE s must be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless of 
whether or not the patient has been administered study  drug.
Progression of treatment indication including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs 
or symptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy  variables and assessed as unequivocall y 
associated with the disease progression and/or lack of efficac y, should NOT be reported as

as possible (within 24 hours of learning o f the pregnancy )to the SAE/pregnancy  fax number, 
 even if no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of male 
patients must also be reported. The pregnancy must be followed to term, and the outcome 
reported b y completing a follow -up Pregnancy  Form. If, however, the pregnancy  is 
associated with a nSAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), in addition to the 
Pregnancy  Form, a separate SAE Form must be filed as described in Section 9.3with the 
appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated.
9.[ADDRESS_646746] ≥ [ADDRESS_646747] 
repeat testing within 48 to 72 hou rs to confirm the abnormality . For this repeat testing, the 
following 
tests should be performed : hematology  and chemistry  panels, international 
normalized ratio (INR), and a toxicology  screen for acetaminophen. In addition, the 
investigator should perform a complete history  and exam inationto evaluate for possible liver 
disease. 
All ALT or AST elevations ≥ [ADDRESS_646748] elevation ≥ [ADDRESS_646749] is confirmed and the patient meets any 
of the following criteria, close medical follow -up is required:
Patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3 times UL N and ≤ [ADDRESS_646750] to possible liver disease (ie, no fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia [> 5%])

Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-04 Amendment 3
50 GDD-TA-T-004 v2015.10Patients with ALT or AST ≥ 3 times UL N and ≤ 5 times the UL N and (total bilirubin 
< [ADDRESS_646751] and INR < 1.5)
Patients who meet these criteria should be followed clinically, and further medical evaluation 
should be performed per the judgment of the investigator and in conjunction with medical 
personnel at Allergan. The chemistry  panel should be repe ated 1 to 2 times per week to 
follow the course of ALT/AST elevation. An extra blood sample should be collected and sent 
to the central laboratory  for further diagnostic testing at a later date if needed.
If an ALT or AST elevation ≥ [ADDRESS_646752] is con firmed and the patient meets any 
of the following criteria, close medical follow -up is required:
ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_646753] and the patient is sy mptomatic with the appearance 
of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, r ash, or 
eosinophilia (> 5%)
ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_646754] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_646755] or INR > 1.5
ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_646756]
In addition, for these patients, possible etiologies for acute hepatic injury  should be excluded. 
The following laboratory tests should be performed:  anti -hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface 
antigen, anti -hepatitis B core IgM, hepatitis C antibody, hepat itis C quantitative RNA b y 
polymerase chain reaction ( PCR), anti-hepatitis E IgM. An extra blood sample should be 
collected and sent to the central laboratory  for further diagnostic testing at a later date if 
needed. The patient should be followed clinical ly, and further medical evaluation should be 
done per the judgment of the investigator and in conjunction with medical personnel at 
Allergan. In general, the chemistry  panel should be repeated 1 to 2 times per week to follow 
the course of ALT/AST elevation. For procedural details on the medical evaluation of liver 
disease, please see the Study  Reference Manual.
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_502173]/AST elevation ≥ [ADDRESS_646757]. All AL T/AST elev ations should be 
followed until AL T and AST return to < 1.[ADDRESS_646758] and there is full clinical 
resolution.

Section 3 –Study 
DesignThe follow ing revision was made in this 
section:
This multicenter, randomized, open -label, 
52-week extension study will enroll 
approximately 1200 patients from 
approximately 200 centers in the United 
States. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to 
1 of the following 3 treatment groups: usual 
care, ubrogepant 50 mg, or ubrogepant 
100mg (400 patients per arm). The study is 
open-label; however, randomization to the 
ubrogepant arms (50 and 100 mg) will be 
blinded. If and when an interim analysis 
occurs, the doses will be unblinded (see 
Section 7.6).The randomization to the 
ubrogepant arms has been 
blinded; however, this 
section was revised because 
after the interim analysis, if 
performed, Allergan will be 
unblinded to the ubrogepant 
doses. Sites and patients 
will remain blinded 
throughout the study. 
Details of the interim 
analysis and blinding are 
provided in Section 7.6.
Section 5.4 –Treatment 
Allocation Ratio and 
StratificationThe follow ing revision was made in this 
section:
Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 
the following 3 treatment groups: usual -care, 
ubrogepant 50 mg, or ubrogepant 100 mg. 
The study is open -label; how ever, 
randomiza tion to the ubrogepant arms 
(50and 100 mg) will be blinded . If and 
when an interim analysis occurs, the doses 
will be unblinded (see Section 7.6).The randomization to the 
ubrogepant arms has been 
blinded; however, this 
section was revised because 
after the interim analysis, if 
performed, Allergan will be

OTHER DEP ARTMENTS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY (IF APPLICABLE):   
☐ Division of Critical Care Medicine  
☐ Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute  
 
DATE :  
April 15, 2020  
 
 
 
 
Objectives  
● To improve glycemic control in inpatient/ICU settings using real - time continuous glucose moni tors 
(CGM) data for insulin titration.  
● To use (CGM) as a means to reduce COVID -[ADDRESS_300603] with healthcare workers  
 
Hypothesis  
● Use of real time and retrospective data of CGM can be utilized with inpatients/ ICU settings to 
increase time spent in target glycemic range (1).  
● CGM real time data access can reduce frequency of healthcare worker exposure to COVID - 19 patients 
without compromising glycemic control.  
 
Background  
Due to the increasing need for acute care of COVID -19 patients in ICU settings , the use of 
continuous glucose monitors (CGM) as a means to reduce patient contact [CONTACT_247116] -19 patients’ needs to be explored. As demonstrated by [CONTACT_247117], Wuhan province patients with diabetes made up 22.2% of COVID -19 ICU patient 
populations with a subsequent mortality of 7.3% (3). Not only during COVID -19 pandemic but also 
previous experiences with SARS and influenza viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_247101] (4).  
Using CGMs provides timely access to glucose trends, commonly used to determine insulin 
dosing decisions in outpatient settings (5). Implementing their use for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247102] e worker insight into glycemic control therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Considering the ease of transmission of the SARS -Cov-[ADDRESS_300604] 2020, the FDA released a 
statement to announce that they “will not object” to the use of CGM’s in COVID -[ADDRESS_300605] with COVID -19 
patients should be utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for each encounter. In this 
time of limited PPE supply (6), remote glucose monitoring can allow for rational use of these limited 
resources. With appropriate tra ining on CGM data interpretation, nursing and ordering providers could 
expect to develop and implement more efficient insulin plans, requiring less frequent physical contact 
[CONTACT_102555] -[ADDRESS_300606] or may require CGM use  
 
Exclusion Criteria for COVID 19 Participants  
1. In state of active diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at time of enrollment  
2. Two or more vasopressors in use at time of sensor placement  
3. Unable to use at predetermined sensor site based on assessment of skin health  
Inclusion Criteria For Heart Failure ICU Patients  
1. Age over 18 years  
2. Admitted to Heart Failure ICU, with possible transfer to inpatient unit when stable  
3. Patients with known or acquired Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes requiring insulin therapy during admission  
 
Exclusion Criteria For Heart Failure ICU Patients  
1. In state of active diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at time of enrollment  
2. Two or more vasopressors in use at time of s ensor placement  
3. Unable to use at predetermined sensor site based on assessment of skin health  
 
Number of Research Participants  
We will enroll 46 subjects at UHCMC and plan to enroll 100 subjects study wide. Approximately 18 
patients from UH Ahuja Medical  Center, 18 from UH Geauga Medical Center, and 18 from UH Portage 
Medical Center are intended to make up the remaining 100 participants.  
 
Out of the 46 at UHCMC, 6 participants will be enrolled from UHCMC heart failure ICU to provide a 
nonCOVID -19 participa nt set. Heart failure and COVID -19 participants will be enrolled concurrently.  
 
 
Recruitment Methods   
1) Patients will be selected from the COVID -[ADDRESS_300607] or may require CGM use, should be selected 
for recruitment. Of note, Heart Failure ICU patients are not covered under the FDA’s non -objectionable 
use of CGM statement due to their COVID negative status. Heart Failure ICU participants will only have 
access to CGM after consented enrollment into study.  
2)Critical care team will contact [CONTACT_247118] 24hrs a day, 7 days a week. Study personnel will review patient EMR to 
evaluate for inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
3) To promote physician to physician recruitment, flyers will be posted within the COVID ICU at 
the reception desk and [ADDRESS_300608] 
study personnel. This flyer includes inclusion/exclusion criteria, brief study summary, and study 
personnel contact [CONTACT_3031].  
4) Evaluation of decision making capacity of potential participa nts. If the participant has met the 
inclusion criteria, they will then undergo the assessment for decision making capacity. This will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_247119]:  
 
1. Is the participant alert and able to communicate with t he investigator/study team?  
2. Is the participant sufficiently comfortable to be able to communicate?  
3. Is the participant medically stable such that a consent process is feasible?  
 
If the participant is unable to complete any of these three steps, the stu dy team will consider whether it 
is possible to return to the potential participant to repeat the assessment within 24 hours. If not 
possible, then the study team will call upon the legally authorized representative (LAR)/next of kin of the 
potential parti cipant to consent. The contact [CONTACT_247120]/next of kin will be obtained from 
the primary ICU team of the potential participant.  
If the potential participant fulfills all three decision making criteria, and the study team has established 
the meth od of communication, the study team will engage in the consent process with the potential 
participant if he/she is willing.  
· If the individual declines, no further engagement is pursued.  
· If the individual agrees, we will conduct a post -consent quiz foll owing the consent process and 
we will document the results of the post -consent quiz.  
o If the potential participant does not pass, the study team will review the material with 
the individual and re -administer the quiz one more time.  
o If the individual doe s not pass the second time, but is still interested in participating, 
the legally authorized representative of the potential participant will be sought.  
 
The post -consent quiz: (participant will have to answer all 4 questions correctly to pass)  
1) “Can you tell me what will happen if you decide to be in this study?”  
2) “How will being in this study help you?”  
3) “Can anything bad happen to you by [CONTACT_98690]?”  
4) “What do you need to do (who do you talk to) if you change your decision?”.  
 
At this point , the investigator establishes whether the participant has the decision making capacity or 
not. A written consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_247121], once the patient is 
established to have capacity and agreeable to participate in the study.  
 
If the patient is not able to provide written consent due to mechanical issues in writing a verbal consent 
will be obtained in the presence of a witness. The signature [CONTACT_247141].  
 
The investigator will continue once dail y assessment of participants' decision making capacity. This will 
be repeated until the completion of study participation. Should the participant regain decision capacity, 
the consent process will be repeated directly with the participant.  
 
5) COVID -19 Recr uitment:  
The study personnel will approach the patient who has met the inclusion criteria via their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247103]. The study team will introduce the study, allow for any questions, and 
see if the patient is interested. If t hey are, the potential participant will be provided a full IRB -approved 
informed consent document. This will be transmitted by [CONTACT_247122] a link to RedCap full consent 
form. The potential participant may receive a paper copy on request, which will be  transferred to them 
by [CONTACT_247123]. The study team will arrange a mutually convenient time 
for a full informed consent process with the potential participant. The platform doxy.me will be utilized 
for virtual interaction. At t he arranged virtual meeting time, the study team member who will be 
consenting sends a text message or email “invitation” to the potential participant along with the REDCap 
e-consent link with the full consent form for the participant to view. Once both pa rties are on the virtual 
visit, the study team member will verify patient identification. The potential participant will be asked 
his/her full name [CONTACT_18131]. Once identity has been verified, the full informed consent process 
will take place during  the virtual visit. If the participant decides to enroll, an electronic signature [CONTACT_247142] e -consent link during the virtual visit. If the potential participant is unable to 
utilize the electronic format signature, he/she can sign a paper copy during the virtual visit and can take 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_247104].  
 
 
 
6) Heart Failure ICU Recruitment:  
The study personnel will approach the patient who has met the inclusion crit eria in their ICU room to 
introduce the study and give the patient a paper copy of the consent form to review. The review of the 
consent form will be done in the patient’s room. The patient will be given more than 1 hour to review 
the consent form and stud y details in private. The patient and study personnel will set a time window 
for return to the ICU room the same day for review and discussion of the study. The study personnel will 
return to the patient’s room at the previously set appointment time. If th e participant decides to enroll, 
the consent process will take place.  
 
 
7) Adults unable to consent/ LAR/next of Kin Recruitment:  
The study personnel will approach the LAR/Next of Kin for the potential participant who has met the 
inclusion criteria by [CONTACT_247124]. The identity of and contact [CONTACT_247125]/Next of Kin will 
be obtained from the critical care team. The potential participant’s LAR/ next of kin will be provided a 
full IRB -approved informed consent document. This will be transmitted by e mail or text as a link to 
RedCap full consent form. The study team will arrange a mutually convenient time for a full informed 
consent process with potential participant’s LAR/ next of kin. The platform doxy.me will be utilized for 
virtual interaction. Onc e the time is arranged ahead, the study team member who will be consenting 
sends a text message or email “invitation” to the LAR/ next of kin of the potential participant along with 
the REDCap e -consent link with the full consent form. Once both parties ar e on the virtual visit, the 
study team member will verify LAR/next of kin’s identification. The potential participant’s LAR will be 
asked his/her full name, date of birth, and to display their driver’s license. If not available, any state or 
government -issued pi[INVESTIGATOR_247105]. Once identity has been verified, the full 
informed consent process will take place during the virtual visit. If the participant decides to enroll, an 
electronic signature [CONTACT_247143] e -consent  link during the virtual visit. If the 
LAR/next of kin is unable to utilize the electronic format signature, he/she can sign a paper copy during 
the virtual visit and can take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_247106] e virtual visit.

Study Procedures   
● Prior to CGM implementation by [CONTACT_105] -study personnel, COVID ICU or Heart Failure team 
involved in use and interpretation of CGMs will be given training lectures via WebEx for remote viewing. 
Lectures are c reated by [CONTACT_247127]. These lectures will be made available on WebEx 
several times each week so that involved team members may participate at their convenience, but 
before they use Dexcom G6 device with a patient in their care.  
● Patients w ill be selected from the COVID -19 specific or Heart Failure ICU patient populations, 
identified as requiring frequent glucose monitoring for insulin management by [CONTACT_247128].  
○ Critical care team will contact [CONTACT_247129] e and pager numbers or 
Doc Halo secure messaging available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Study personnel will review 
patient EMR to evaluate for inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
○ Flyers describing the study with study personnel contact [CONTACT_48158] p laced in 
ICU workspace for employee viewing.  
● Patients in the COVID -[ADDRESS_300609] access to CGM after consented 
enrollment into study.  
● Stud y personnel will follow the consent process as described above.  
● The COVID ICU staff trained by [CONTACT_247130]:  
○ Transmitter ID syncing  
■ Enter “SN” number on the back of the transmitter into the display device 
before en tering patient’s room  
○ Sensor Placement  
■ No numbing agents are required for sensor placement  
■ The ICU healthcare provider will need to wash their hands and wear PPE as 
per COVID ICU protocol and gloves in the Heart Failure ICU.  
■ The insertion site is c leaned with an alcohol pad at the point of an imaginary 
line of the mid axillary at the level of the umbilicus. Let dry.  
■ The applicator is taken from the sensor packaging. The Sensor packaging is 
kept until the sensor session is complete.  
■ The sensor is  checked for damage  
■ The adhesive labels are pulled off while not touching the adhesive.  
■ The applicator is placed horizontally, not vertically, on skin.  
■ The adhesive is firmly pressed down to the cleaned skin.  
■ The safety guard is folded and broken f rom the applicator and thrown away.  
■ The insertion button is pressed and released to insert the sensor.  
■ The applicator is removed and thrown out.  
○ Transmitter Attachment  
■ The bottom of the transmitter is wiped with alcohol wipe and allowed dry. 
The me tal dots on the bottom should not be touched other than alcohol wipe.  
■ The transmitter tab is then slid into the slot at the narrow end of the holder 
on the sensor patch.  
■ The wide end of the transmitter is pressed until it clicks into the holder.  
■ It is secured in place by [CONTACT_247131].  
○ Glucose data transmission  
■ After the insertion of the sensor and attachment of the transmitter, the 
transmitter will automatically pair with the display device via bluetooth co nnection.  
■ The sensor will have a 2 hour warmup period before glucose data is collected. 
After warm up Dexcom data will include only interstitial glucose levels, which are 
recorded every 5 minutes by [CONTACT_247132]  
■ The ICU staff will be prompted by [CONTACT_247133] 2 -hour warmup is finished, then calibrate every 24 
hours after that time as prompted by [CONTACT_247132].  
■ The ICU staff will record CGM glucose data as displayed on CGM receiver in to 
the “Point of Care” free text flowsheet every 2 hours in the patient’s chart  
■ The ICU nursing staff will additionally collect point of care finger glucose 
readings every 4 hours or as they are scheduled to enter the patient’s room for standard 
of care in ICU setting.  
■ CGM data is saved in the receiver component of the device until downloaded 
at the end of device use. Download will be saved as an electronic copy with participant’s 
anonymised ID code as the file name. This file will be stored in the secu red shared drive 
accessible only to study personnel.  
● CGM sensor will transmit glucose data in real -time to the receiver placed within a 20 foot 
distance from the patient on the glass door outside the ICU room. Glucose data can then be 
viewed in real time  by [CONTACT_20900].  
● Dexcom will also provide glucose telemetry software which will allow for remote viewing of 
glucose data from all the patients on CGM.  
● The sensor is a single use, disposable device while the transmitter and the display device wi ll 
be cleaned with alcohol and glucose data downloaded and cleared from the device between 
participants. This data download is facilitated via Dexcom Clarity App.  
● CGM sensors may be worn for a maximum of 10 days at a time throughout the participants’ 
ICU admission. If a patient's ICU stay exceeds [ADDRESS_300610] it with a new sensor on the patient’s opposite side at the point 
of an imaginary line of the mid axillary at the level of the um bilicus. The same transmitter is 
reattached to the new sensor after being clean with alcohol wipe. 2 hour warm up period will 
repeat and use of CGM will resume as before. Total maximum use for study purposes is 20 days 
(2 sensor uses).  
● Point of care fing er glucose readings will be collected every 4 hours. Of these, one fingerstick 
reading daily will be used for calibration of CGM device at the time prompted by [CONTACT_247134]. 
● Any CGM glucose readings suggestive of hypoglycemia measuring less than 70 mg/dL , 
provider/nurse is to confirm with fingerstick glucose reading, then treat according to UH 
hypoglycemia protocol.  
● Any CGM glucose readings suggestive of hyperglycemia measuring greater than 300 mg/dL, 
care provider is to confirm with fingerstick glucose  reading, notify ordering provider then treat 
according to insulin order placed by [CONTACT_247135].  
● Enrolled participant’s information will be collected from UH Inpatient EMR. This information 
will include patient name, MRN, DOB, height, weight, gender, ethnic ity, type of diabetes and 
diabetic complications, past medical history of lung disease or cancer, home diabetic 
medications, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247110], history of smoking and alcohol use, symptoms on 
admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], daily vital signs, blo od electrolytes, chemistries including renal and 
hepatic function, Coronavirus test results, blood cell counts, Hemoglobin A1c, laboratory blood 
glucose, finger stick glucose, daily insulin requirement, inotropic support, mechanical ventilation 
status, ren al replacement therapy, antibiotic and glucocorticoid use, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
length of ICU admission, imaging modalities used, any adverse events including hypoglycemia 
and death.  
● At the removal of each CGM device, the sensor will be discarded and  the transmitter along 
with the receiver/display device will be cleaned with alcohol pads appropriately before using it 
with another patient.  
● Imaging considerations  
○ CGM should not be used during MRI. Both the transmitter and the sensor must be 
removed prior to MRI.  
○ It is not harmful to the patient to wear a CGM during x -ray or CT scan. In order to 
maintain sensor and transmitter integrity, these devices should be shielded with lead during CT 
or x-ray, so long as the intended imaging field is not disru pted.  
 
Study Timeline  
● Each study subject will be included for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum of 20 
days. If patient’s ICU stay exceeds [ADDRESS_300611] to continue CGM use, 
but no further CGM data will be downloaded or preserved for  study purposes.  
● Data will be downloaded at the end of each CGM device use for each individual study 
participant.  
● Study will be conducted until the minimum goal of 46 subjects is reached.

- % of time spend in low (180mg/dL)  
- Number of hypoglycemic excursions (sensor  = 20 minutes)  
- Glucose variability assessed by:  
- %coefficient of variation (%CV)  
- Mean absolute glucose (MAG)  
- Low blood glucose index  
- In ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]  
- length of ICU stay  
- total admission duration  
- Point of care glucose  
-venous blood glucose  
- Reduction in patient contact [CONTACT_247136]/intervention as compared to q2hr, q4hr, and q6hr POCT glucose checks  
- Enrolled participant’s information will be collected from UH Inpatient EMR. 
This information will include patient name, MRN, DOB, height, weight, gender, ethnicity, 
type of diabetes and diabetic complications, past medical history of lung disease or 
canc er, home diabetic medications, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247110], history of smoking 
and alcohol use, symptoms on admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], daily vital signs, blood 
electrolytes, chemistries including renal and hepatic function, Coronavirus test results, 
blood cell counts, Hemoglobin A1c, laboratory blood glucose, finger stick glucose, daily 
insulin requirement, inotropic support, mechanical ventilation status, renal replacement 
therapy, antibiotic and glucocorticoid use, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], length of ICU 
admission, imaging modalities used, any adverse events including hypoglycemia and 
death.  
 
Data Analysis Plan  
Each patient’s CGM data will be aggregated (e.g., across repeated measures) by [CONTACT_247137]. As a largely descriptive study, standard summ ary statistics will be 
computed. Means and standard deviations will be used to summarize the primary 
outcome (% of time spent in target glucose range of 140 -180mg/dL) as well as all other 
continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be used to su mmarize 
categorical variables. Poisson regression will be used to determine whether use of CGM 
reduced the number of times healthcare workers were in contact [CONTACT_102555] -[ADDRESS_300612] glucose checks. Univariate and 
multiv ariate regression models will be used to explore potential associations between % 
of time spent in target range and secondary outcomes (e.g., length of stay in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247112]) while controlling for relevant covariates.  
 
Risks to Research Participants  
Sensors may fracture on rare occasions. There is a potential rare risk of sensor breakage 
and part of it may remain under the skin causing symptoms of infection or 
inflammation —redness, swelling or pain — at the insertion site. (8) CGM sensor readings 
may b e affected by [CONTACT_247138]. Volume contraction, 
renal dialysis, use of vasopressor medications, and metabolic acidosis are examples of 
physical conditions which may impact sensor readings. In the event that CMG data is 
discor dant to clinical presentation, an alternate glucose reading from fingerstick or lab 
will be considered. There is also a risk of breach of confidentiality.  
 
Protect the Privacy Interests of Research Participants  
Primary identification for recruitment will be  provided by [CONTACT_247139]’s care. These patients will be presented to study personnel for 
evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria confirmation. Once confirmed as a potential 
participant, an anonymised code will be assigned to that patient’s MRN. The 
anonymised code log sheet will be maintained only in a secured shared drive. 
Confidentiality of data will be preserved during data transmission via the use of 
anonymised codes. Participants will be assigned codes base d on order and location of 
enrollment. Identifiable personal information will be stored securely in a locked room at 
the Department of Endocrinology at UHCMC. Electronic versions will be saved on a 
desktop computer at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247113]. 
Data will be accessible only to the Research Team and for audit in a secured shared 
folder.  
 
 
 
Potential Benefit to Research Participants   
Benefit for COVID - 19 positive participants  
 Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may improve insulin management 
 Opportunity for the participants to learn about a device which you may use at 
home if covered by [CONTACT_150401].  
 Alerts offer improved glycemic variation awareness  
 Help to es tablish effective inpatient methods of CGM use for general diabetic 
patient admissions  
 Potential benefit to healthcare providers by [CONTACT_247140] -CoV-2 
virus  
Benefits for COVID -19 Negative participants (participants in HFICU)  
 Detailed infor mation about glucose patterns available to healthcare team 
which may improve insulin management.  
 Opportunity for the participant to learn about a device which you may use at 
home if covered by [CONTACT_150401].  
 Alerts offer improved glycemic variation awareness  
 Help to establish effective inpatient methods of CGM use for general diabetic 
patient admissions  
 
Withdrawal of Research Participants  
If the subject has serious event related to study  
Investigator initiated discontinuation due to participation o r equipment concerns 
Patient withdrawal of consent  
Data collected up until the point of withdrawal may be included in the study  
Patient no longer requires glucose monitoring for their care  
 
Alternatives to Participation   
Patient may elect to use POCT finger stick glucose measurement [ADDRESS_300613] or Committee.  
 
 
Drugs or Devices

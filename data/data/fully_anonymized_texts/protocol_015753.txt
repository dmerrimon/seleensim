Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_807993]-line treatment for patients with 
metastatic urothelial cancer. However, a large proportion of patients with metastatic urothelial 
cancer are suboptimal candidates for such treatment due renal impairment and/or other smoking- 
and age-related comorbidities.2–[ADDRESS_807994]-line treatment for 
cisplatin-ineligible patients with metastatic urothelial cancer has shown promise with 
encouraging safety and durable anticancer activity.6 However, only ~20-25% of patients respond 
to treatment highlighting the need for combination regimens which extend these therapeutic 
benefits to a larger proportion of patients.[ADDRESS_807995] in regimens combining cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune 
checkpoint blockade.7 The potentially favorable effects of chemotherapy on the antitumor 
immune response can be broadly grouped into two categories: (1) inducing immunogenic cell 
death and (2) disrupting strategies that tumors exploit to evade the immune response (e.g., 
modulating the quantity or function of immune cell subsets). Importantly, inducing immunogenic 
cell death may occur as part of the intended therapeutic effects of chemotherapy and therefore 
likely occurs at standard doses and schedules of chemotherapy (though based on data in model 
systems, is very much drug dependent). Alternatively, in model systems, various 
chemotherapeutic drugs can also deplete negative regulators of the immune response such as 
myeloid derived suppressor cells or regulatory T cells. Compared with the induction of 
immunogenic cell death, however, these effects of chemotherapy on the immune system are 
likely much more dose and schedule dependent (and may occur predominantly at unconventional 
doses and schedules). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a considerable literature on the impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
on the antitumor immune response, the vast majority of combination strategies being explored in 
the clinic to date simply combine cytotoxic drugs utilized for a particular disease indication with 
immune checkpoint blockade which may overlook the critical importance of the specific 
cytotoxic agents utilized. Optimizing combination strategies requires an understanding of the 
immunomodulatory effect of chemotherapy one is seeking to exploit and ideally demonstrating 
both clinical and pharmacodynamic evidence to support further study.  
 
Immunogenic cell death refers to the process of cell death accompanied by [CONTACT_609368]-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).8,9 While 
normal apoptosis is non-immunogenic, and may even be tolerogenic, immunogenic cell death 
can induce an immune response through activation of dendritic cells and subsequently T cells. 
Immunogenic cell death occurs primarily as a result of endoplasmic reticulum stress and 
production of reactive oxygen species leading to translocation of DAMPs to the cell surface of 
the dying cell where it functions as an “eat me” signal. DAMPs involved in immunogenic cell 
death, including calreticulin and high-mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB1), bind to several 
pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are expressed on antigen 
presenting cells. Importantly, genetic polymorphisms of the HMGB1-TLR4 axis have been 
shown to be associated with worse outcomes in patients with breast cancer and colon cancer

1.[ADDRESS_807997] as targets, and that the antitumor 
effects of platinum drugs may occur in part through immune modulation. Importantly, cisplatin 
and carboplatin do not induce immunogenic cell death, despi[INVESTIGATOR_609357].12,13 This is attributed to the lack of calreticulin 
exposure after cisplatin/carboplatin treatment as these compounds do induce ATP and HGMB-1 
release. Indeed, the ability of drugs to trigger immunogenic cell death as a standalone 
intervention thereby [CONTACT_609369] a “vaccine” that is efficient in the absence 
of adjuvants is shared by a relatively restricted set of lethal triggers. Among studies of triggers 
of immunogenic cell death in model systems to date, oxaliplatin has been consistently 
identified .12–[ADDRESS_807998] 
explored the combination of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (Table 1) demonstrating both efficacy 
and safety in this patient population.

1.5 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab (BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
antibody that binds to the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1), a negative regulatory 
molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-

Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 12 of 71 exceeded 6 months. The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in 
combination with other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 4,000 subjects 
treated to date. For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety profile has been similar across tumor 
types.  
 
1.6 Nivolumab in urothelial cancer 
The safety and activity of single-agent nivolumab in advanced urothelial cancer has been 
explored in two prospective clinical trials to date. CheckMate 032 was a phase 1/2 study 
enrolling 86 patients to treatment with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; [ADDRESS_808000] 
one dose of treatment.18 A confirmed objective response was achieved in 19 (24.4%, 95% CI 
15.3-35.4) of [ADDRESS_808001] majority of responses were durable. Based on these results, 
a large phase II trial was initiated to confirm the safety and activity of nivolumab in metastatic 
urothelial cancer. CheckMate 275 enrolled 270 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer  who 
had progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_478443]-based chemotherapy.19 With a minimum follow-up of 7 
months, the objective response rate was 19.6% (95% CI 15.0-24.9%). While higher tumor PD-L1 
expression (as measured by [CONTACT_9064]) on tumor cells was associated with a 
numerically higher objective response rate, responses were seen even in patients with PD-L1 
expression <1% [objective response rate = 16.1% (95% CI 10.5–23.1]. Responses occurred 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] [median time to response = 1.9 months (1.6–5.9)] and were durable; at a median follow-
up of 7 months, 77% of responses were ongoing. The safety profile of nivolumab was consistent 
with what has been observed across other prior indications (Table 2 and 3).

1.7 Combining nivolumab with platinum-based chemotherapy 
An expansion of the CheckMate 012 study explored nivolumab in combination with platinum-
based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer including combination 
regimens with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, paclitaxel plus carboplatin, or pemetrexed plus 
cisplatin (n= 56).20 The safety profile of nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was 
consistent with that expected for the individual agents. A second trial explored the combination 
of nivolumab 10 mg/kg + gemcitabine plus cisplatin, pemetrexed plus cisplatin, paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin plus bevacizumab or docetaxel (n=24) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer.[ADDRESS_808003], but as yet unexplored, hypothesis – that the choice of 
cytotoxic agents matters with regards to potential synergy when combining chemotherapy and 
immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, we will test whether integration of a cytotoxic agent 
capable of inducing immunogenic cell death will improve outcomes in combination with PD-1 
blockade.  
 
In summary, the proposed trial is supported by [CONTACT_609370]: 
 
1. The development of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_609358]-ineligible patients with metastatic urothelial 
cancer is an unmet need. 
2. Single agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has shown durable responses in cisplatin-ineligible 
patients with metastatic urothelial cancer but only 20-25% of patients respond to treatment. 
3. Chemotherapy has demonstrated immunomodulatory effects in model systems. In particular, 
induction of immunogenic cell death may lead to synergy in combination with immune 
checkpoint blockade. However, combination regimens have generally advanced to the clinic 
without consideration of the potential importance of the choice of cytotoxic agent.

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_808004] pursued in the chemotherapy-naïve setting (i.e., because achieving cell death is a 
prerequisite for achieving immunogenic cell death, chemotherapy naïve cancers will likely be 
most amenable).  
5. Oxaliplatin has consistently been demonstrated to induce immunogenic cell death in model 
systems.  
6. Gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin has already demonstrated safety and activity in multiple phase 2 
trials in cisplatin-ineligible patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.

4.1 Randomization and Stratification 
Randomization will be stratified on the metastasis status (unresectable primary and/or lymph 
node only vs. the rest). 
 
  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 18 of 71 5. TREATMENT PLAN 
Patients will be randomized to Arm A: gemcitabine plus carboplatin plus nivolumab versus Arm 
B: gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin plus nivolumab. Randomization will be stratified on the 
metastasis status (lymph node only vs. the rest). Patients on both treatment arms will receive up 
to [ADDRESS_808009] stable disease at the completion of 6 cycles of treatment may 
continue “maintenance” single agent nivolumab for up to 12 cycles. Patients who require 
discontinuation of chemotherapy (i.e., gemcitabine plus carboplatin or gemcitabine plus 
oxaliplatin) prior to Cycle 6, but who have at least stable disease, may be considered for ongoing 
treatment with single-agent nivolumab on the “maintenance” phase after discussion with the 
sponsor-investigator. 
 
5.1 Pre-Medication Guidelines  
 
5.1.1 Gemcitabine, Carboplatin or Oxaliplatin 
Institutional standards may be used for infusion of chemotherapy including premedication 
administration.  NOTE: Infusions may be given ± 2 days for reasons such as observed holidays, 
inclement weather, scheduling conflicts, etc. It should be clearly documented in patient’s chart 
and case report forms. Body surface area and chemotherapy drug dose recalculations may occur 
per institutional standards.  
 
5.1.2 Nivolumab 
There are no required premedications for the administration of nivolumab.  NOTE: Infusions 
may be given ± 2 days for reasons such as observed holidays, inclement weather, scheduling 
conflicts, etc. It should be clearly documented in patient’s chart and case report forms. An 
infusion window of ± 10 minutes may be applied. 
 
5.2 Medication Administration 
For both Arms A and B, the sequence of administration should be nivolumab  gemcitabine  
platinum agent. Nivolumab will be administered prior to any other chemotherapy with at least a 
30-minute period  between nivolumab administration and the initial chemotherapy.

5.3 Concomitant Medications 
 
5.3.1 Allowed Concomitant Medications 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be 
required.  The site investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the sponsor-
investigator.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the site 
investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the site 
investigator, the sponsor-investigator and the subject. 
 
 All treatments that the site investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may 
be administered at the discretion of the treating investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_353178].   
 All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_808010] dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  
 Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over-the-counter 
preparations used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening evaluation and 
the treatment discontinuation visit.

 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy not specified in this protocol 
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 
5.4 Supportive Care 
The use of supportive care will be permitted as clinically indicated and according to institutional 
guidelines. The use of white blood cell and red blood cell growth factors should be consistent 
with ASCO guidelines. Growth factors should be not used during Cycle #[ADDRESS_808011] dose 
of nivolumab (or timeframe outlined per package insert for chemotherapy). This timeframe also 
applies to breast feeding. Two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, 
or a barrier method plus a hormonal method.  
 
NOTE: Women of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as [ADDRESS_808012] a documented serum follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL. 
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_808013] agree to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or to use 2 forms of effective 
methods of contraception beginning with time of consent, during the study treatment and for the 
timeframe outlined per package insert for chemotherapy. This timeframe also applies to sperm 
donation. Two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier 
method plus a hormonal method.

*Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence 
are not required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to 
have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be 
discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence. 
 
LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
 Diaphragm with spermicide 
 Cervical cap with spermicide 
 Vaginal sponge 
 Male condom without spermicide  
 Progestin only pi[INVESTIGATOR_114547]’s WOCBP partner  
 Female condom (A male and female condom must not be used together)  
 
6. DOSE DELAYS/MODIFICATIONS  
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 will be used to grade 
adverse events. Subjects enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard 
laboratory tests before and at regular intervals during their participation in this study as specified 
in Section 7. Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, 
and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation at each study visit for the 
duration of their participation in the study.   
 
6.1 Initiation of New Cycle of Treatment 
Dose modifications will be based on blood counts within 3 days prior to Day 1 or Day 8 of each 
cycle.  
 
Each treatment cycle will begin only when (provided criteria in Section 6.7 also met):  
 ANC ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 
 Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3 
 Resolution of non-hematologic toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline 
 AST, ALT and  3.[ADDRESS_808014]

HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 22 of 71 Subjects requiring treatment to be held for toxicity > 4 weeks will be removed from study 
treatment and should proceed with definitive management of their tumor as per their treatment 
physician.  
 
6.2 Treatment Limiting Adverse Event 
A treatment-limiting adverse event is any adverse event related to study treatment (includes 
carboplatin or oxaliplatin, gemcitabine and nivolumab) experienced during the study resulting in 
treatment termination.   
 
6.3 Dose Adjustments for Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and Oxaliplatin 
The following dose reductions should be utilized as directed by [CONTACT_609373]

1 dose level. If gemcitabine and carboplatin/oxaliplatin have already been reduced to dose level -
1, reduce gemcitabine to dose level -2. If gemcitabine has already been reduced to dose level -2, 
discuss dose reduction with sponsor-investigator. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be 
used at the discretion of the site investigator; however, growth factors should be not used during 
cycle #1 or in lieu of recommended dose reductions. 
 
  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 23 of 71 **If ANC ≥ 1500 and platelets ≥ 100,000 within 14 days, proceed with “Day 8” gemcitabine 
reduced by 1 dose level. If gemcitabine has already been reduced to dose level -2, discuss further 
dose reductions with sponsor-investigator. If dose delay >14 days required for recovery of ANC 
≥ 1500 and platelets ≥ 100,000, omit “Day 8” dose of cycle and resume treatment with the 
subsequent cycle of treatment with gemcitabine and carboplatin/oxaliplatin reduced by 1 dose 
level. If gemcitabine has already been reduced to dose level -2, discuss dose reduction with 
sponsor-investigator. 
 
If gemcitabine plus carboplatin/oxaliplatin is held on Day 1 of a treatment cycle for hematologic 
toxicity as outlined above, nivolumab will also be held until criteria are met to initiate the cycle of 
treatment. 
 
There should be no dose re-escalation after a dose reduction.  
 
6.5 Febrile Neutropenia 
If febrile neutropenia develops in a given cycle, hold gemcitabine, carboplatin/oxaliplatin, and 
nivolumab during febrile neutropenia.  
 
Resume gemcitabine and carboplatin/oxaliplatin at one dose lower than the dose administered in 
the last cycle. This dose should be used for all subsequent cycles. The dose of nivolumab will be 
unchanged. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be used at the discretion of the site 
investigator. 
 
6.6 Dose Delays/Modifications for Other Treatment Related Non-Hematological 
Toxicity Secondary to Gemcitabine or Carboplatin/Oxaliplatin 
Dose delays/reductions for non-hematologic toxicities attributable to gemcitabine or 
carboplatin/oxaliplatin (with the exception of alopecia or nausea/vomiting not optimally 
managed with antiemetics) are outlined in the table below. Only the drugs felt to be contributing 
to the toxicity per the site investigator should be dose reduced. Patients with treatment-related 
nausea that is Grade ≥ 2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_25461] 1 dose level.  
If the Day 8 dose of gemcitabine is held for non-hematologic toxicity, the “Day 8” dose of 
gemcitabine may be administered the following week provided the adverse event was adequately 
improved or resolved. If the adverse event has not adequately improved or resolved within 2 
weeks, the “Day 8” dose of gemcitabine should be held for that cycle and treatment should 
resume (once the adverse event improves/resolves) with the next cycle of treatment. 
 
Dose Reductions of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Oxaliplatin for Non-Hematologic Toxicities* 
 
Non-Hematologic toxicity Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Oxaliplatin 
Grade 0-2 No change

Dose re-escalation after a dose reduction for non-hematologic toxicity should not occur without 
discussion with the sponsor-investigator. 
 
If toxicity is specifically attributable to gemcitabine or carboplatin/oxaliplatin and warrants 
discontinuation of that particular agent, patients may be considered for continuation on treatment 
with carboplatin/oxaliplatin (or gemcitabine) and nivolumab but this must be discussed with the 
sponsor-investigator. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_808015] been developed for 
suspected AEs of selected categories. [see current Investigator Brochure and Appendix A] 
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug-related adverse events (regardless of whether or not the 
event is attributed to nivolumab). All study drugs must be delayed until treatment can resume. In 
rare circumstances, treatment with gemcitabine plus carboplatin/oxaliplatin could potentially be 
continued in the setting of select adverse events related to nivolumab after discussion and 
approval from the sponsor-investigator. 
 
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following: 
Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the following exceptions: 
 Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a treatment delay 
 Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE 
 Any Grade [ADDRESS_808016], ALT, total bilirubin, or asymptomatic amylase or lipase: 
 Grade 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require dose delay. 
 If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 2 toxicity. 
 If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity. 
 Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose delay. The 
sponsor-investigator should be consulted for such Grade ≥ 3 amylase or lipase 
abnormalities.

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 25 of 71 Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the site 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
 
Subjects who require delay of nivolumab should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently 
if clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re-treatment criteria are met. 
 
6.7.2 Criteria to Resume Treatment 
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab when the drug-related AE(s) resolve to Grade ≤1 
or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
 Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue  
 Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity  
 Subjects with baseline Grade [ADDRESS_808017]/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for 
reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in 
the presence of Grade [ADDRESS_808018]/ALT OR total bilirubin 
 Subjects with combined Grade [ADDRESS_808019]/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently discontinued 
 Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to baseline 
before treatment is resumed.  
 Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment . 
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the next 
scheduled timepoint per protocol. However, if the treatment is delayed past the next scheduled 
timepoint per protocol, the next scheduled timepoint will be delayed until dosing resumes. 
 
If treatment is delayed or interrupted for > [ADDRESS_808020] be permanently 
discontinued from study therapy, and should proceed with definitive treatment of their primary 
tumor as per their treating physician, unless otherwise discussed and approved by [CONTACT_3211]-
investigator (e.g., in the setting of completion of a steroid taper).   
 
6.7.3 Management Algorithms for Immune-Related Events 
Guidelines for the management of immune related events can be found in the current Investigator 
Brochure AND in the Appendix A.  Site investigators should decide the appropriate source of 
AE management for each protocol. 
 
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab is considered an immuno-oncology 
agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immuno-
oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed to 
assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs: Gastrointestinal, 
Renal, Pulmonary, Hepatic, Endocrinopathies, Skin, Neurological. 
 
For subjects expected to require more than 4 weeks of corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressants to manage an AE, consider recommendations provided in the algorithms. 
These algorithms are found in the Nivolumab IB [and in Appendix A] of this protocol. The

hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms of allergic-like reactions.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4 guidelines. 
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate: 
 
For Grade 1 symptoms:  (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated) 
 Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 
mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 
minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e.g., antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours). 
 Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms 
recur then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit. Administer 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_808023] be recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are 
recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or 
paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes 
before additional nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended 
dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.

symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] 
[e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).  
 Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, 
and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of 
a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 
solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for 
the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms.  
 
In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids). 
 
6.8 Discontinuation Criteria for Nivolumab

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_808036] became aware of this clinical trial. Should also include 
diagnosis and staging information: Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM). Prior genomic or molecular results, performed in laboratories for standard 
clinical purposes (e.g., targeted DNA sequencing panels for “actionable” mutations) are required if available.  
 
2 Vital signs to include blood pressure, weight, and ECOG performance status. Height should be obtained at screening only. 
 
3 CMP to include sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen; liver function tests (LFTs) to include AST, ALT, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase  
 
4 If screening (baseline) CBC and CMP were performed within 7 days of Day 1 of treatment, these do not need to be repeated.  
  
5 Thyroid function testing will be done every other cycle during treatment. TSH, T3 and T4 should be performed; free versus total for T3 and T4 is 
at the site investigator’s discretion. 
 
6 For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): urine or serum βhCG, within [ADDRESS_808037] not yet experienced progressive disease (PD) at the time treatment is 
discontinued, the follow-up tumor evaluations will be documented in the eCRF until PD or death is confirmed, or until another treatment is 
initiated.  A bone scan will be obtained at baseline if any clinical or laboratory suspi[INVESTIGATOR_334853]. If a bone scan is positive 
at baseline for metastases, it will be included with tumor response assessments as noted above.  
 
8 Archival tissue:  Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens (metastatic specimens preferable but if not available 
primary tumor specimens that are at least muscle-invasive are acceptable) in paraffin blocks (blocks preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides. If 
archival tissue is not available, subjects may be considered for enrollment on a case by [CONTACT_609371]-investigator.  
Stored samples will be reserved for future unspecified cancer-related research. See Correlative Laboratory Manual (CLM) for additional details.

HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 32 of 71 11 Serial blood samples will be collected to support biomarker research. These samples will be separated into whole blood, plasma and PBMCs. 
Timepoints for collection of whole blood: C1D1, C2D1, C3D1; timepoints for PBMCs C1D1, C3D1, progression/safety visit; timepoints for 
plasma C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, progression/safety visit.  See CLM and Table 4 for additional details. 
 
12 Subjects with suspected clinical progression should undergo imaging (CT chest and CT or MRI abdomen and pelvis) to document disease 
progression. An MRI is strongly suggested if the subject cannot have contrast for the CT scans. Bone scans should also be performed in the setting 
of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_609360]. Blood samples for research purposes should be collected at the time of disease progression (Table 4). 
 
13The initial safety follow-up visit should only occur when subjects permanently stop study treatment for whatever reasons (toxicity, progression, 
or at discretion of site investigator) and should be performed 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of treatment. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥ 
grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at this visit will continue to be followed until the AE resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, deemed clinically 
insignificant, and/or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever is earlier. Subjects discontinuing study treatment for disease progression 
who have not already had blood samples drawn for research purposes (Table 4) at “progression” should have specimens drawn at this visit. The 
D100 (± 7 days) safety visit will consist of a phone call, email or other avenues as appropriate to assess AEs.  
 
14 Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason without documented disease progression will be followed for disease progression every 3 
months x 1.5 years, every 6 months x 1.5 years, and then yearly x 2 years (from treatment discontinuation). Once disease progression is 
documented, subjects will enter a survival follow up period every [ADDRESS_808039] no 
evidence of disease progression or prohibitive adverse events should proceed with “maintenance” single agent nivolumab as detailed in the 
calendar of events below. Subjects who require discontinuation of chemotherapy (i.e., gemcitabine plus carboplatin or gemcitabine plus 
oxaliplatin) prior to cycle 6, but who have at least stable disease, may be considered for ongoing treatment with single-agent nivolumab on the 
“maintenance” phase after discussion with the sponsor-investigator.  Long term follow up visits have a window ± 14 days.

Tumor tissue, peripheral blood, and possibly normal urothelium will be used for biospecimen-
based research in this study. The schedule of biospecimen collection(s), and ensure this schedule 
is reconciled with the Study Calendar. Full details of specimen collection and processing can be 
found in the CLM. 
 
Correlative studies will include genomic sequencing of tumor tissue and/or peripheral blood and 
immune monitoring studies including T cell receptor sequencing and flow cytometry and/or mass 
cytometry on tissue and/or peripheral blood, antigen-specific T cell assays, HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 
gene expression.  
 
8.1 Tissue Samples 
 
8.1.1 Archival Tissue  
Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens (metastatic 
specimens preferable but if not available primary tumor specimens that are at least muscle-
invasive are acceptable) in paraffin blocks (blocks preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides. If 
archival tissue is not available, subjects may be considered for enrollment on a case by [CONTACT_609375]-investigator. Samples will be utilized for studies including 
DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and characterization of the tumor and tumor 
microenvironment using existing and emerging technologies. Samples may also be stored for 
future cancer-related research. See Correlative Laboratory Manual (CLM) for additional details. 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_808044] of care procedures (e.g., metastatic biopsies) will 
be collected during this study. Subjects may have tumor tissue obtained during the course of the 
study or at the time of disease progression for clinical purposes (e.g., confirmation of disease 
progression, management of complication of disease progression, etc.). Specimens obtained in 
these settings may be accessed by [CONTACT_478461].  Subjects will have the option of whether samples obtained 
during standard of care procedures may be used for research purposes.

9. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION

diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_808048] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_808049] scan, or >[ADDRESS_808050] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters). 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_808051] be >[ADDRESS_808052] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
9.2 Non-measurable Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_118445]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 
NOTE:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
 
9.3 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of 
the disease. 
 
9.4 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.

NOTE: In addition to the information below, also see section 4.3.2 in the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee, version 
1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247) for special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete 
Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm. 
Partial Response 
(PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive 
Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
Stable Disease 
(SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study  
 
9.6 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes 
must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/ Non-PD Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits 
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative of 
overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_334854], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_16170].

Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that 
the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response 
status.

Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_808060] package insert for complete details regarding gemcitabine. 
 
10.2.1. Chemical Name 
1” – Deoxy – 2, 2” – difluorocytidine monohydrochloride, Gemzar, NSC #613327 
 
10.2.2 Action   
Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly by [CONTACT_14191] 
(dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. The cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine is 
attributed to a combination of [ADDRESS_808061], gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits 
ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate the 
deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by [CONTACT_404137] a reduction in the concentrations of deoxynucleotides, including dCTP. 
Second, gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The 
reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP (by [CONTACT_14193]) enhances 
the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA (self-potentiation). After the 
gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, only 1 additional nucleotide is added to the 
growing DNA strands. After this addition, there is inhibition of further DNA synthesis. DNA 
polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the gemcitabine nucleotide and repair the growing DNA 
strands (masked chain termination). 
 
10.2.3 Availability  
Gemcitabine is commercially available.  
  
10.2.4 Storage, Reconstitution, and Administration 
Storage, Reconstitution, and Administration as per institutional guidelines 
 
10.2.5 Side Effects 
Hematologic: In studies in pancreatic cancer, myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity with 
gemcitabine, but <1% of patients discontinued therapy for either anemia, leukopenia, or 
thrombocytopenia. Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence 
of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was 
reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients 
should be monitored for myelosuppression during Gemcitabine therapy and dosage modified or 
suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity. 
 
Gastrointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild 
to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3-4) occurred in <15% of 
patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients.  
 
Hepatic: Gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of 1 or both serum transaminases 
in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with 
either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious 
hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients 
receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 46 of 71 Renal: In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical 
findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 
patients (0.25%) receiving gemcitabine in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on 
Gemcitabine therapy, 2 immediately posttherapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if 
the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin 
or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of 
serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal 
failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required. 
 
Fever: The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection 
(16%) and indicates that gemcitabine may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever 
was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically 
manageable.  
 
Rash: Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a macular or finely granular 
maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. 
Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients.  
 
Pulmonary: In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in 
association with gemcitabine therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by [CONTACT_315642]. 
Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine (see Pulmonary under Post-
marketing experience, below). The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, 
Gemcitabine should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate 
these conditions.  
 
Edema: Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. 
Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema.  
 
Flu-like Symptoms: “Flu syndrome” was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of 
fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever 
and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, 
and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like 
symptoms.  
 
Infection: Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%).  
 
Alopecia: Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients.  
 
Neurotoxicity: There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe 
paresthesias. 
 
Extravasation: Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no 
reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine is not a vesicant.  
 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 47 of 71 Allergic: Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has 
been reported rarely. Gemcitabine should not be administered to patients with a known 
hypersensitivity to this drug.  
 
Cardiovascular: During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with gemcitabine due 
to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and 
hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease (see 
Cardiovascular under  Post-marketing experience, below). 
 
Post-marketing experience: The following adverse events have been identified during post-
approval use of gemcitabine. These events have occurred after gemcitabine single-agent use and 
gemcitabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are 
based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to 
gemcitabine. 
 
Cardiovascular   Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very 
rarely with the use of gemcitabine. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have 
been reported very rarely.  
 
Vascular Disorders   Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported 
very rarely. 
 
Skin  Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have 
been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, 
have been reported very rarely.  
 
Hepatic  Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and 
death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination 
with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.  
 
Pulmonary   Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, 
pulmonary edema, and adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), has been reported rarely 
following [ADDRESS_808062] 
gemcitabine dose. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_609364].  
 
Renal  Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following 1 
or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despi[INVESTIGATOR_199989], has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure 
leading to death were due to HUS.  
 
Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications   Radiation recall reactions have been reported

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 48 of 71 Pregnancy Category D. Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Gemcitabine is embryotoxic causing fetal malformations (cleft palate, incomplete 
ossification) at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day in mice (about 1/200 the recommended human dose on a 
mg/m2 basis). Gemcitabine is fetotoxic causing fetal malformations (fused pulmonary artery, 
absence of gall bladder) at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in rabbits (about 1/600 the recommended 
human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Embryotoxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_609377], 
reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. There are no studies of gemcitabine in 
pregnant women. If gemcitabine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant 
while taking gemcitabine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
 
Nursing mothers. It is not known whether Gemcitabine or its metabolites are excreted in human 
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions from gemcitabine in nursing infants, the mother should be warned and a 
decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into 
account the importance of the drug to the mother and the potential risk to the infant.

11 ADVERSE EVENTS 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE v4 will be utilized for AE 
assessment. A copy of the CTCAE v4 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov.  
 
11.1 Definitions 
 
11.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence whether or not considered related to the study drug 
that appears to change in intensity during the course of the study. The following are examples of 
AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associated with participation in the protocol 
 An intercurrent illness or injury that impairs the well-being of the subject 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] 
(e.g., surgical insertion of central line) should not be recorded as an AE.  
Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable to the study 
regimen by [CONTACT_6962]. 
 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an adverse event that: 
 Results in death. NOTE: Death due to disease progression should not be reported as a 
SAE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_3987](s) 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] >24 hours or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. NOTE: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334857], central line insertion, metastasis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious 
adverse events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-287 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 51 of 71 medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
11.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event 
For this study, an AE is considered unexpected when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency 
from information provided in the current IB, prescribing information or when it is not included in 
the informed consent document as a potential risk. Unexpected also refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or are anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.   
 
11.1.4 Relatedness 
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study drug(s). 
Specifically, they will be categorized using the following terms:  
 
Unrelated Adverse Event is not related  to the study drug(s)  
Unlikely Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the study drug(s)  
Possible Adverse Event may be related  to the study drug(s)

12 STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
12.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, open-labeled phase 2 trial of gemcitabine + carboplatin + nivolumab or 
gemcitabine + oxaliplatin + nivolumab for the treatment of cisplatin-ineligible patients with 
metastatic urothelial cancer.  Randomization will be stratified on the lymph node only (and/or 
unresectable primary) metastatic status.  
 
12.2 Endpoints 
 
12.2.1 Definition of Primary Endpoint 
 Response rate as determined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 
 
12.2.2 Definition of Secondary Endpoints 
 Safety will be determined according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4 
 Duration of response will be the time from the first documentation of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_808067] 1.1. 
 Progression-free survival which is defined as the time from randomization to death or 
progression, depending on which occurs first 
 Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 54 of 71 12.3 Sample Size and Accrual 
A randomized phase 2 ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] a winner design’ will be employed.1 Two regimens are to be studied 
and the expected baseline response rate is ~40%. With [ADDRESS_808068] probability 
0.9 of selecting the regimen that has a true response rate of 40%+20%=60% [or, allows selection 
of the regimen that is 18% better (in terms of response rate) than the other regimen with 0.88 
probability and 15% better with 0.83 probability]. We will inflate the sample size on each study 
arm to account for early drop-outs/unevaluable patients to ~24 patients per arm. Because our 
randomization is stratified on the lymph node (LN) only (and/or unresectable primary) metastasis 
status, we further calculate the probability of correctly selecting the better treatment, similar to 
the Table 3 in Simon et al. (1985) 1. In particular, we assume that approximately 30% of patients 
will have LN only metastasis. Response rate can be as high as 60% for this particular group. The 
probabilities of correctly selecting the better treatment are listed in the table below assuming the 
response rate for the LN only metastasis range from 50% to 60%. The overall response rate is 
fixed at 40%. We can see that these probabilities are satisfactory and do not seem to be 
substantially impacted by [CONTACT_609379].

Toxicity rates will be summarized using frequency tables. Comparison between the treatments 
will be conducted using the Fisher’s exact test. Time to event outcomes (i.e. Duration of 
response, progression-free survival, and overall survival) will be analyzed using the Kaplan-
Meier method. Comparison between the treatments will be conducted using the log-rank test.

measurements. Association of these markers (i.e. their changes) with the response will be 
explored using t-tests. Their association with the time-to-event clinical outcomes will be 
explored using the Cox proportional hazards model. Model assumptions will be checked and if 
violated, other models will be attempted. Similar analyses will be conducted for the tumor tissue 
biomarkers based on a subset of patients (5 patients per arm). However, the small sample size 
may prohibit formal statistical analysis. Impact of somatic mutations, including DNA damage 
response gene alterations on response rate will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test. Their 
impact on the time-to-event outcomes will be explored using the log-rank test. Antigen-specific 
T cell responses in peripheral blood (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) will be analyzed using t-
tests.

arm. Two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) of these grade ≥ 3 immune-
related adverse event rates will be constructed.  
 
When the trial was initially designed, there were no large datasets in urothelial cancer of 
platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and limited published studies with 
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in urothelial cancer in the first-line setting. Based on the datasets available 
at the time, the study was designed such that if the lower bounds of the 95% CI for grade ≥ 3 
immune-related adverse event rate exceeded 3% for either arm, that regimen would be 
considered to be associated with excessive toxicity and enrollment to that arm would be halted. 
However, during the conduct of the current study, two large randomized trials exploring 
platinum-based chemotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 blockade 
versus PD-1/PD-L1 blockade have been published provided much more robust data on which to 
base the grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse event rate with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade alone in this 
patient population as well as with platinum-based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in 
this patient population. There data are summarized in the tables below.

 Arm A = platinum-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab, Arm B = atezolizumab, Arm C = platinum-
based chemotherapy 
 
Based on these large randomized trials in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, the grade ≥ 3 
immune-related adverse event rate with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade alone or with platinum-based 
chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is ~9%. Based on these findings, in the current study, 
if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse events exceeds 9% 
for either arm, the study regimen being explored in that arm will be considered to have excessive 
toxicity and enrollment to that arm will be halted. This corresponds to ≥ 3+ (3 or more) out of 7, 
≥ 5+ (5 or more) out of 14, and ≥ 6+ out of 21 subjects.

1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3 Open -Label Extension Study to Ev aluate the Long -Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Vibegron in Men with Overactive Bladder (OAB) Symptoms on Pharmacological 
Therapy for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)  
Protocol Number:  URO -901-3006 
Brief Title:  Extension Study of Vibegron in Men with OAB Symptoms With BPH  
Study Rationale : Beta -3 adrenergic receptor (β 3-AR) agonists have shown efficacy (with 
improved safety relative to anticholinergics) in treating persistent OAB symptoms in men on BPH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This subset of the broader OAB population setting has unique safety needs (eg, 
possibility of urinary retention) that have not been fully evaluated in previous clinical programs of OAB treatments.  Study URO -901-3006 is designed to evaluate long- term safety and efficacy 
of vibegron (75 mg once daily [QD] administered for 28 weeks ) in men with symptoms of OAB 
while receiving pharmacological therapy for BPH who have received 24 weeks of study drug in double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 Study URO-901-3005.  
Objectives : The primary study objective is to assess the long -term safety of  vibegron when 
dosed for up to 52 weeks in men with OAB  symptoms on pharmacological therapy for BPH  who 
previously completed treatment in Study URO-901-3005. The primary clinical hypothesis is that 
vibegron + BPH pharmacological therapy for BPH treatment is safe for long -term use in men 
with OAB symptoms and BPH.  
The secondary  study objective is to assess the long -term efficacy of vibegron when dosed for up 
to 52 weeks in men with OAB symptoms on pharmacological therapy for BPH who previously completed treatment in Study URO -901-3005. 
Endpoints:   
Note: With respect to study endpoints, “per day” refers to  a “Diary Day” , which  is defined as the 
time between when the subject  gets up for the day each morning and the time the subject  gets up 
for the day the next morning as recorded in the subject  bladder diary  (approximately a 24 -hour 
period).  
Safety assessments will include treatment emergent AEs , clinical laboratory tests , physical 
examination s, vital signs , PVR volume, and Total IPSS. 
Urovant Sciences, GmbH  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 8 22 May 2019 Efficacy  endpoints include the following: 
• Change from baseline (C FB) at Week [ADDRESS_1133001] urition epi[INVESTIGATOR_818137] 
• CFB at Week 52 in the average number of urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (urgency: need to urinate 
immediately)  per day  
• CFB at  Week 52 in the average the number of nocturia epi[INVESTIGATOR_665801]  
• CFB at Week 52 in the average number of urge urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_818138]-901-3005  
• CFB at Week 52 in the average of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) 1- week 
recall) Storage  score (1 -week recall)  
• CFB at Week 52 in the average volume voided per micturition 
See Section 3 (Objective and Endpoints) for the other/ exploratory endpoints , including quality-
of-life endpoints. 
Statistical Methods:  
Safety analys es will be based on all subjects  who receive vibegron (through Week  52 of this 
extension study). Only one treatment group (vibegron) will be reported for  safety data. Baseline 
will be the baseline for Study URO-901-3005. Descriptive s tatistics will be used to summarize 
safety endpoints.  
The efficacy analyses  will be for descriptive purposes only and will be conducted using the FAS-
Extension population, which is a subset of the Study URO-901-[ADDRESS_1133002] completed  the 24 -week treatment period in Study URO-901-3005 and enrolled into this 
extension study.   The efficacy endpoints of change from baseline in average number of micturitions , average 
number of urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], average number of nocturia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], average  number of urge 
urinary incontinence ( UUI) epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], average of IPSS storage score, and average volume voided 
per micturition  will be analyzed separately using a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) 
with restricted maximum lik elihood estimation. The analysis model for each efficacy endpoint 
will include terms or visit, baseline,  baseline stratification  factors (those found to be significant 
in Study URO -901-3005). An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the 
correlation among repeated measurements. The Kenward -Roger adjustment will be used with 
restricted (or residual) ma ximum likelihood (REML) to make statistical inference. The adjusted 
mean s for vibegron and visit will be estimated along with the 95% CI.  Only th e week -52 subjects 
(those on active treatment in Study URO-901-3005 and in Study URO-901-3006) will be 
included in the model. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all efficacy endpoints. Summaries of efficacy 
endpoint will be presented by [CONTACT_1192] t reatment groups: vibegron f or 52 weeks and vibegron for 
28 weeks  as determined by  [CONTACT_818157] -901-3005.

Version 1.0 9 22 May 2019 Overall Study Design : This is an international Phase 3, open- label 28-week extension study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of vibegron [ADDRESS_1133003] 
completed the Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, 24- week Study URO -901-3005.  
Approximately 300 men with symptoms of OAB  on stable dose s of pharmacological therapy for 
BPH who completed 24 weeks in Study URO -901-3005 and continue to qualify for this study 
may be permitted to enroll in this extension study, from  approximately 60 study sites.  
During this extension study, subjects who had been randomized in Study URO -901-3005 to 
receive vibegron 75 mg will continue their same treatment once daily for an additional 28 weeks , 
and subjects who had been randomized in Study URO -901-3005 to the placebo group will 
receive study treatment of vibegron  75 mg once daily for 28 weeks during the extension. Thus, 
through participation in both the URO-901-3005 and URO-901-3006 (extension) studies, subjects originally randomized to vibegron will receive [ADDRESS_1133004] 
study visit of this extension study occurring at Week 24. Following enrollment in this  extension 
study, subjects will return to the clinic for visits at Week 28, Week  36, and Week 52 (all relative 
to Day 1 of S tudy URO -901-3005). A telephone contact [CONTACT_44056] 44 to review 
AEs/serious AEs (SAEs) and concomitant medications. 
This stu dy consists of a 28 -week  open -label Treatment Period . Unscheduled Visit(s) may be 
arranged as needed.  
Number of Subjects : Up to 300 subjects who complete Study URO-901-3005 may  be offered 
the opportunity to roll over into this study.  
Number of Sites : Appr oximately 60 sites in North America and Europe. 
Study Drug  Groups  and Study Duration:  75 mg vibegron, QD, administered orally. Study 
drug will be administered in an open-label (not blinded) manner for 28 weeks  on Study URO-
901-3006. Note: upon entering this extension study, all subjects  will have already received 
2 weeks of treatment with placebo plus an additional 24 weeks of blinded treatment with either 
vibegron or placebo in Study URO-901-3005. No dosage adjustments will be allowed. 
Subjects will continue on the same alpha- blockers ( eg, tamsulosin, doxazosin, and alfuzosin) 
with or without 5α -reductase inhibitors (5- ARIs) use  (eg, finasteride, dutasteride, and alfatradiol) 
in Study URO -901-[ADDRESS_1133005] (DSMB) : A DSMB  will be retained to assess, on an ongoing 
basis, all safety aspects of this study. This will be an  external  independent DSMB that monitors 
the safety for both Study URO-901-3005 and Study URO-901-3006. The detailed activities 
includi ng meeting plan s will be described and documented in the DSMB C harter . A separate 
statistical analysis plan will be prepared  for the DSMB .

Version 1.0 12 22 May 2019 2. Introduction  
2.1. Study Rationale  
Men with overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy 
(BPH ) represent an OAB subpopulation that has not been extensively studied. Often in these 
patients, OAB symptoms remain inadequately addressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_818139] 
(ie, alpha-blocker with or without 5-ARI). For reasons described below, this population warrants 
specific clinical studies to adequately evaluate and address their unique medical needs. Study URO-901-3006 is an extension study to Phase 3 Study URO-901-3005 designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vibegron (75 mg once dail y [QD]) for up to 52 weeks in men 
with OAB symptoms on pharmacological therapy for BPH. 
2.2. Background  
2.3. Overactive Bladder in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia  
OAB is highly prevalent and affects approximately 16% of the population in the U nited States  
and Europe. Prevalence increases with age, affecting approximately one third  of people 75 years 
and older [ Stewart , 2003; Milsom , 2001]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_818140], men are less likely to use treatment for OAB  [Goldman, 2016].  
The International Continence Society (ICS) defines OAB as urgency, with or without ur ge 
incontinence, usually associated with frequency and nocturia [ Abrams , 2002]. Urgency is 
defined as a sudden compelling desire to void which is difficult to defer and, from the medical definition perspective, it is a necessa ry sym ptom for OAB. Urgency incontinence is the 
involuntary loss of urine accompanied by [CONTACT_165547] (referred to as OAB Wet) and is present in approximately one- third of patients with OAB [ Stewart, 2003; Milsom, 2001]. In the absence of 
incontinence, OAB is referred to as OAB Dry. Urgency incontinence is distinguished from stress urinary incontinence, which is the involuntary loss of urine on effort or physical exertion (eg, sporting activities), or  upon sneezing or coughing . When both components are present, the 
classification is mixed urinary incontinence, with either urgency or stress specified as the predominant component .  
Although the overall prevalence of OAB in men and women is similar, there are major differences in predominating symptoms. Men are more likely to experience u rgency, frequency, 
and nocturia accompanied by [CONTACT_818158] (LUTS) associated with voiding dysfunction, whereas women are twice as likely to experience incontinence [ Tubaro, 2017]. 
Since most men with OAB symptoms do not have urinary incontinence, the micturition frequency and the urgency become the predominant symptoms that characterize the disease for 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 13 22 May 2019 the men with OAB on pharm acological therapy for BPH [ Helfand, 2012]. Among men, urinary 
incontinence significantly increases after the age of [ADDRESS_1133008] OAB symptoms in the 
absence o f, or in conjunction with, voiding symptoms associated with BPH or urodynamic 
evidence of bladder outlet obstruction [ Nakagawa, 2008; Hyman, 2001]. BPH can be associated 
with debilitating LUTS, c ategorized by [CONTACT_818159] (eg, urinary frequency, urgency, and 
nocturia) and voiding dysfunction (eg, decreased and intermittent force of stream and the 
sensation of incomplete bladder emptying).  
2.3.1. Vibegron  
Initial pharmacologic therapy for OAB symptoms in men with BPH traditionally has been directed at minimizing the obstruction and has included α1- adrenergic receptor antagonists to 
relax the muscles of the prostate an d bladder neck or 5- ARIs  to reduce prost ate growth  
[American Urological Association, 2010]. While patients may see some improvement in OAB 
symptoms with these BPH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, improvement in urinary flow), symptom control for OAB symptoms is incomplete, for many, and urinary urgency, incontinence, frequency, or nocturia persists [ Abrams, 2002]. To address persistent OAB symptoms in men with BPH, 
combinations of BPH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_818141], such as anticholinergics, have shown promi se [Chapple, 2009; Oelke, 2013]. However, the clinical use of anticholinergics is limited 
by [CONTACT_181001] -based side effects including dry mouth and constipation [ MacDiarmid, 2008] and 
the potential for CNS adverse effects [ Gray, 2015 ; Risacher, 2016]. Further, 
contraindications/precautions exist due to the possibility of urinary retention and bladder out flow 
obstruction [ Detrol prescribing information, 2016].  
ß3-adrenoceptor (β
3-AR) agonists for OAB (eg, mirabegron) have demonstrated efficacy in 
treating persistent OAB symptoms in men on BPH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ Ichihara, 2014 ] with a more 
favorable safety profile relative to the anticholinergics . In fact,  experts have recommended that 
these agents be specifically studied in this patient population [ Maman,  2014; Chapple, 2009; 
Van Kerrebroeck, 2001; Chapple, 2017].  
Vibegron is a potent and highly selective β 3-AR agonist demonstrating >  9000- fold selectivity 
for activation of β 3-AR over β 2-AR and β1-AR in cell based in vitro assays . β-adrenergic 
receptors are prototypic G -protein coupled receptors expressed on the sur face of cells, and 
mediate intracellular sig naling via coupling to G s and increasing levels of intracellular cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). β 3-ARs are widely distributed in humans and are the most 
prevalent β -AR subtype expressed on human detrusor smooth muscle [ [COMPANY_005], 2000]. In isolated 
human bladder smooth muscle, activation of β 3-AR using subtype- selective agonists results in 
smooth muscle relaxation suggesting a role for β 3-AR agonists during the filling phase of the 
micturition cycle [ Yamaguchi, 2002; Biers, 2006]. In rodent models of bladder overactivity, β 3-
AR agonists relax bladder smooth muscle and suppress detrusor smooth muscle instability and hyperreflexia [ [COMPANY_005], 2000; Woods, 2001; [COMPANY_005], 2002; Kaidoh, 2002]. In rhesus monkeys, 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 14 22 May 2019 dose dependent increases in bladder capacity  and decreases in micturition pressure were 
observed with vibegron. Bladder capacity was further increased by [CONTACT_818160] [ Di Salvo, 2017 ]. These results have supported a large and  
comprehensive clinical develo pment program for vibegron in the general OAB population, 
including both male and female subjects. 
More than  2300 subjects (including 1840 with OAB  and 460 healthy volunteers) have received 
vibegron in Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies . Assessment of safe ty laboratory parameters and 
mean vital sign values over time, including heart rate and blood pressure, showed no clinically

comparators. A large, multicenter Phas e 3 study of vibegron for the treatment of OAB in women 
and men is ongoing. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs) were low (< 5%) in all 
clinical studies  conducted to date with vibegron. In a completed Phase [ADDRESS_1133009] voided residuals observed [ Yoshida, 2018]. A more detailed description of vibegron, including

2.4. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
2.4.1. Potential Benefits  
Vibegron’s mechanism of action has the potential to demonstrate significant therapeutic benefit in the treatment of  OAB symptoms in men with  BPH on pharmacological therapy for their BPH 
symptoms . 
2.4.2. Potential Risks  
The initial clinical program for vibegron in the treatment of OAB includes subjects  of both sexes. 
It is estimated that the ongoing Phase 3 program in OAB (RVT-901-3003 and RVT-901-3004) will include approximately 15% males, which will contribute to safety data comprising more than [ADDRESS_1133010] (AESIs) predefined for specific evaluations in vibegron clinical studies are as follows:  
• Potential major cardiovascular events  
• Hypertension  
• AEs suggestive of orthostatic hypotension as confirmed by [CONTACT_818161]  
• AEs suggestive of cystitis or urinary tract infection  
• Elevated aspartate transaminase ( AST ) or alanine transaminase ( ALT ) laboratory  value

Version 1.0 18 22 May 2019 4. Study Design  
4.1. Overall Design  
This study is a Phase 3, open- label, 28-week extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of vibegron 75 mg in men with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) on stable doses of 
pharmacological therapy for BPH . This study is an extension for subjects who have completed 
the Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, 24- week Study URO-901-3005.  
Subjects  who complete Study URO-901-3005 may  be given the opportunity to enroll in this 
extension study. It is anticipated that approximately 300 men who completed Study URO-
9013005 and continue to qualify for this study may  be permi tted to enroll in this extension study.  
During this extension study, subjects who had been randomized to receive vibegron 75 mg in Study URO -901-3005 will continue their same treatment once daily for an additional 28 weeks; 
subjects who had been random ized to receive placebo in Study URO-901- 3005 will receive 
study treatment of vibegron 75 mg once daily for 28 weeks during this extension study. Thus, through participation in both the URO-901-3005 and URO-901-3006 (extension) studies, subjects originally  randomized to vibegron will receive [ADDRESS_1133014] 
study visit of this extension study occurring at Week 24 (Visit 11). Following enrollment in this 
extension study, subjects will return to the clinic for visits at Week  28, Week  36, and Week 52 
(all relative to Day 1 of URO -901-3005). A telephone co ntact will occur at Week 44 to review 
AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications. 
This study consists of a 28 -week  open -label Treatment Period . Unscheduled Visit(s) may be 
arranged as needed .  
4.1.1. Clinical Hypotheses  
The primary clinical hypothesis is that is th at the vibegron + pharmacological therapy for BPH 
treatment is safe in men with OAB symptoms and BPH . 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
The clinical use of anticholinergics is limited by [CONTACT_655271], notably, contraindications 
and precautions unique to men with OAB symptoms receiving treatment for BPH due to the possibility of urinary retention and bladder outflow obstruction. ß3-adrenoceptor agonists have shown efficacy (with improved safety relative to anticholinergics) in treating persistent OAB symptoms in men on BPH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ Ichihara, 2014]; however, no therapeutic agents are labeled 
specifically for this population, and clinical stud y data  have been limited . In addition, this 
population has a distinct symptom profile and relevant efficacy needs (eg, nocturia) that warrant further study .   
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 19 22 May 2019 4.3. Justification for Dose  
This study will use a vibegron dose of 75 mg QD, which is the same dose used for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_61493] 3 study of OAB in men and women ( RVT -901-3003) and the associated long- term Phase 3

7.3. Lost to Follow Up  
Should a subject fail to attend a required study visit, the site should attempt to contact [CONTACT_818162]-schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also counsel the subject  on 
the importance o f maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the 
subject  wishes to and/or should continue in the study based on previous non- compliance. In 
cases where the subject  does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_818163] a primary reason of “Lost to 
Follow-up”. Including at least three documented attempts to conta ct the subject  (ie, phone, email, 
or certified letter) . Efforts to establish the possible reason for discontinuation should be 
documented. 
7.4. Early Study Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for any reason . The study may be 
termin ated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of emerging effects/clinical endpoints is 
such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study overall or at a particular stu dy site may be stopped due to 
insufficient compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure-related problems or the number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.

Version 1.0 27 22 May 2019 8. Study Ass essments and Procedures  
Study procedures and their scheduled timepoints are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section 1.3). A detailed listing of study assessments by [CONTACT_818164] 10.7. Site 
personnel should note the following: 
• Protocol waiver s or exemptions are not allowed . Any notable protocol deviations should 
be noted and raised to the Sponsor’s or designee’s attention. 
• Immediate  safety con cerns  should be discussed with the Sponsor’s designated Medical 
Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject  should 
continue or discontinue study drug . 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments, is essential and required for study conduc t. 
• Note that patient- reported outcome (PRO) assessments will be completed prior to vital 
signs, and vital signs will be taken prior to blood draws.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the  subject’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained be fore signing of the ICF may be utilized for the purposes of 
confirming eligibility  (in addition to the most recent available assessments from Study 
URO-901-3005).  
8.1. Study Entry  Procedures  
As this is an extension study that includes subjects from the ongoing parent study, URO-9013005, assessments performed at the end of the parent study will not be repeated on study entry into Study URO-901-3006. Specifically, vital sign, physical examinatio n, laboratory, 
bladder diary, PVR urine, and PRO  assessments performed at the Week 24 Visit of Study URO -
901-3005 will be considered the initial study assessments at entry into extension Study URO -
901-3006. 
In addition, medical history and demographic i nformation from entry into Study URO -901-3005 
will be used as relevant to provide information for Study URO-901-3006.  
8.1.1. Informed Consent  
Documented consent (for Study URO-901-3006) must be obtained from each potential subject 
prior to the first dose of open- label study drug (vibegron) on Study URO-901-[ADDRESS_1133024] reasons for ineligibility , as 
applicable. Inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 5.1 and Section 5.2) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_818165] 24 of Study URO -901-3005). If needed, the Week [ADDRESS_1133025] dose of study drug. 
8.2. Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy assessments will be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 1.3) 
in the form of 3- day Bladder Diary . Information collected in the diaries will be used for 
assessment of the efficacy endpoints related to the number of micturition, urgency, nocturia, and incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_818145]. In addition, subjects will complete IPSS assessments  and
Patient Global Impression (PGI) , and
scores to assess quality of life parameters.  
Subjects will complete questionnaires at the site at the start of each required study visit (before vital signs and blood draws). The PRO questionnaires are provided in Section  10.8. Additional 
information on the Bladder Diary and questionnaires is provided below. 
8.2.1. Bladder Diaries  
Bladder Diary is used by [CONTACT_818166], urgency, incontinence, nocturia, one 24-hr volume voided of urine (used to derive the volume per micturition) , and main reason for incontinenc e, and volume voided per 
micturition (over one 24-hour period) by [CONTACT_818167] a given day and night. 
The Bladder Diary should be completed by [CONTACT_1175] 3 consecutive days within the 7 da ys 
prior to Visit 12 (Week 28), Visit 13 (Week 36) and Visit 14 (Week 52). A “Diary Day” is 
defined as the time between when the subject gets up for the day each morning (ie, the time the subject got up for the day yesterday to the time the subject got up for the day today; approximately a 24 -hour period). Urine volume may be collected during any one (1) of the [ADDRESS_1133026]. Instructions for proper completion of the diary should be re-reviewed. Subjects will be trained t o enter data immediately following each 
event (in real time) and to input data from any “missed” events as soon as they ar e able. They 
will review and confirm that data from all events occurring within the preceding Diary Day (approximately 24 hours) have been entered at a consistent time each morning (eg, upon getting up for the day). 
8.2.2. Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Subjects will complete questionnaires at the site at the start of each required study visit (before vital signs and blood draws) to assess subject-perceived symptom relief, symptom bother, and health -related quality of life. These include the following questionnaires: 
• The IPSS includes 8 questions (7 concerning urinary symptoms and 1 concerning quality 
of life), each with answers based on a 6-point sc ale indicating increasing severity. The 
urinary symptom responses are assigned points from 0 to 5.  The Total IPSS Score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). The quality of life responses are assigned points from 0 to 6. A sample of the IPSS is provided in Section  10.8.1. 
•  (1-week recall) is  a multi- item questionnaire that was developed to assess 
symp tom bother and the impact of  
The instrument was developed and validated in both continent and incontinent OAB patients, including both men and women. A s ample of the  scales is  provided 
in Secti on 10.8.2. 
• The EQ -5D health q uestionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of 
health outcome [ Rabin 2014] . It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and 
treatments; it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index v alue for health 
status. A s ample of the EQ -5D health questionnaire is  provided in Se ction  10.8.3. 
• Global Impression Items include 
 A sample of the PGI scale is  provided in Section  10.8.4. 
• 
The investigator should not provide any additional information to subjects prior to completing the questionnaires that might influence responses
.

Version 1.0 30 22 May 2019 8.3. Safety Assessments  
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments , including assessments for PVR, are provided in 
the Schedule of Assessm ents ( Section  1.3). Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with 
the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to 
determine if the subject should continue or discontinue study drug. 
8.3.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate (by [CONTACT_117682]) , body temperature, and weight, will be 
assessed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Activities and Section 10.7 as  follows: 
• Blood pressure and pulse will be me asured after the subject has been resting in a seated 
position for 5 minutes, after PRO assessments and before blood draws.  
• Blood pressure measurements will be taken on the same arm and by [CONTACT_818168], if possible.  
• Sitting sy stolic and diastolic blood pressures will be determined by [CONTACT_85719] 3 replicate 
measurements obtained approximately 1 to 2 minutes apart. The average of the 3 
measurements will be used for eligibility and safet y assessments.  
• The same method for assessing  temperature should be used at all visits for a particular 
subject.  
• Body weight will be measured with subjects in street clothing with jacket/coat and shoes removed, using the same scale throughout the study, if possible. 
8.3.2. Physical Examinations 
Brief physic al examinations will include examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, and visual 
pelvic examination. In addition, any organ system in which a previous abnormality was noted at Baseline or a subject has a complaint or AE will be examined.  
8.3.3. Post-Void Residu al Volume 
The volume of urine that remains in the bladder after voiding (PVR) is an objective measurement that may serve as a proxy for impaired ability to void. The physician should assess subjects with an increase in PVR volume to determine whether an AE  should be reported. (Refer to 
Section  8.4.6 for additional information on reporting AEs of urinary retention associated with 
increased PVR.)  
The PVR assessment will be performed via ultrasound at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3). All efforts will be made to ensure the same device and operator are 
used for all PVR volume measurements for individual subject s. 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-[ADDRESS_1133027]  results will be evaluated as follows: 
• At Week [ADDRESS_1133028] s with abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be 
excluded from the study. 
• The investigator or physician subinvestigator must review the laboratory report, document 
this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE 
section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. 
Laboratory abnormalities associated with the underlying disease are not considered clinically significant unless judged by [CONTACT_818169]’s condition. 
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significant  during participation in the 
study or within [ADDRESS_1133029] dose of study drug should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_211293]’s designated Medic al Monitor .  
- If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor notified.  
- If laboratory values from nonprotocol speci fied laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject  management or are considered 
clinically  significant by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the e CRF.  
8.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of an  AE or SAE  can be found in Section  10.3. 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_423]  (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject ’s legally authorized  representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are re sponsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE  and remain responsible for following 
up AEs  that are serious, considered related to the study drug  or study procedures, or that caused 
the subject  to discontinue the study drug or the study  (see Section 7). 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-[ADDRESS_1133030] dose of study 
drug (5 half-lives of vibegron [half- life approximately 80  hours]) will also be collected . AEs will 
be collected at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  1.3), and as 
observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_62444] s. 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study drug , but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded in the AE section of the e CRF.  
All SAEs (including serious AESIs) will be recorded and reported on the eCRF within 24 hours  
of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event, as indicated in Section  8.4.4. Marking the 
event as “serious” will  automatically send required notifications for Sponsor or designee review . 
The investigator will also submit any updated SAE data within 24 hours of receipt of the 
information. Nonserious AESIs will be reported on the eCRF within 72 hours  of the site’s 
knowledge of the information 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek  AE or SAE  information after conclusion of the 
study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any  SAE , including a death, at any 
time after a subject has been discharged  from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study drug  or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify 
the Sponsor or designee. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE  reports are provided in Section  10.3. 
8.4.2. Method of Detecting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences . 
8.4.3. Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to pr oactively follow each subject  
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs will  be followed until approximately [ADDRESS_1133031] to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).  If a subject 
dies during participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_1133032] of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_175076]/or causality of the AE or SAE  as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. As noted above, 
the investigator will submit any updated  SAE data to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
8.4.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
• Prompt notification of an SAE by [CONTACT_818170] a study drug  under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study drug  under clinical investigation. The Sponsor 
will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to th e 
regulatory authority, IRBs/IEC s, and investigators.  
• Invest igator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . 
• An investigator who receives an investigator safet y report describing a n SAE  or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of  SAEs ) from the Sponsor or designee 
will review and then file it and will notify the IRB/IEC/REB , if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.4.5. Disease -Related Even ts and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events  
No disease- related events or outcomes are excluded from AE  reporting. Any worsening of OAB 
or BPH sym ptoms or any events of bladder obstruction should be collected as AEs .  
8.4.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Selected nonserious and SAEs  will be reported as AES Is. AESIs  that also meet the definition of 
an SAE must be reported as described in Section  10.3.  
Adverse events of special  interest for this study include:  
• Adverse events consistent with urinary retention 
- An AE  of urinary retention should only be recorded when a subject  has a raised PVR 
that requires inte rvention with clean intermittent catherization (CIC) or temporary 
placement of a urinary catheter  according to the following criteria:  
a) subject  has a PVR of ≥  300 mL (regardless of symptoms), OR 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 34 22 May 2019 b) subject  has a PVR ≥ 200 mL and < [ADDRESS_1133033]  reports associated 
symptoms, ie, sensation of bladder fullness or inability to void despi[INVESTIGATOR_818146], that in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_165527].  
Note: An AE  of residual urine volume should be recorded if, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the raised PVR is clinically significant but does not fulfill the above definition for urinary retention. As stated above in Section 7, subjects with a 
single PVR volume of ≥  300 mL or an AE of urinary retention will be withdrawn 
from the study.  
• Adverse events suggestive of cystitis or urinary tract infection  (UTI)  
- An AE  of UTI will be recorded if both the following criteria are fulfilled, regardless 
of subject  symptoms:  
 a) a positive urine culture result with a bacteriuria count of ≥  10
5 CFU/mL  
 b) leukocyturia of ≥  5/hpf 
If a subject  meets the criteria for the definition of a UTI, the investigator will 
record whether the UTI was “symptomatic” or “asymptomatic” on the AE  
eCRF.  
Note: If urinalysis/culture results are reported which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are considered clinically significant but do not fulfill the above definition of a UTI, the findings should be recorded as AEs  (eg, bacteriuria, 
leukocyturia). 
• Potential major cardiac and cerebrovascular events, including death (or any event with fatal 
outcome), myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818147], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818148], and coronary revascularization/angioplasty/stent  
• Hypertension, defined as follows: 
- For subjects with systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg  at the Study URO -901-3005 baseline assessment , the average of 3 
systolic blo od pressures ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressures ≥  90 mmHg (or 
both) at any 2 consecutive visits after baseline  
- For subjects with systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg at Study URO -901-3005 baseline, an increase compared to baseline at 
2 consecutive visits in the average of 3 systolic blood pressures by ≥  20 mmHg or 3 
diastolic blood pressures by ≥  [ADDRESS_1133034]  
• Adverse events consistent  with orthostatic hypotension as confir med by [CONTACT_818171]-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 35 22 May 2019 • Elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) lab 
value requiring that study drug be temporarily withheld or permanently discontinued (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]). To date, no concern regarding drug-induced liver toxicity has 
been id entified; however, the Sponsor is monitoring laboratory data for a potential s afety 
signal, consistent with Food and Drug Administration guidance [ FDA Guidance, 2009].  
• Neoplasms  
Serious AESIs and elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin requiring withholding of study drug (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) must be reported within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the 
event by [CONTACT_818172]. Additional information should be provided as directed in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. AESIs that also meet the definition of an SAE must be reported as an SAE, as 
described in Section  8.4.4. Nonserious AESIs should be reported within 72 hours of the sit e 
personnel’s knowledge, using the AE eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Treatment in Association with 
Liver Test Abnormalities  
Elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin sufficient to require withholding study medication must be reported within 24  hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event using AE SI 
specific eCRFs/forms/worksheets provided for the study.  
Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines 
[FDA , 2009].  
If any of the following liver test abnormalities develop, Study Treatment should be withheld 
immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a 
subject ’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status), and the eve nt reporte d as an 
SAE :  
• ALT or AST >  8 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
• ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_1133035] and persists for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_1133036] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1133037] or international normalized ratio 
(INR) >  1.5 
• ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_1133038] with appeara nce of fat igue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnorma lities resolve to normal or baseline 
values. The investigator and Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor must discuss and agree with any decision to rechallenge.  
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is con sidered 
possibly drug induced. 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 36 22 May 2019 [IP_ADDRESS]. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment in Association with 
Liver Test Abnormalities  
Study treatment should be discontinued permanently if all  of the following 4 criteria are met (ie, 
potential severe drug -induced liver injury/Hy’s law case):  
• Total bilirubin increases to >  [ADDRESS_1133039] or INR >  1.5 and   
• AST or ALT increases to ≥  [ADDRESS_1133040] and   
• Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach [ADDRESS_1133041] and   
• No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormal ities; 
important alternative causes include, but are not limited to the following:  
- Hepatobiliary tract disease  
- Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus)  
- Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dieta ry 
supplements, plants, and mushrooms  
- Alcoholic hepatitis  
- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  
- Autoimmune hepatitis  
If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified, then it should be determined (based on the 
severity of the hepatotoxicity or event) w hether study drug  should be withheld or permanently 
discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the subject, following consultation with the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor. 
8.4.7. Pregnancy Management and Reporting to the Sponsor 
In the event that  a partn er of a male study subject becomes pregnant during the study, if the 
subject  agrees, the subject’s pregnant partner should be notified of the subject’s study 
participation and be requested to sign a Release of Information form, permitting transfer of 
information regarding the pregnancy and outcome to the Sponsor. If the subject and the subject’s 
partner agree , the investigator should notify the partner’s  primary care physician and provide 
details of the subject’s  participation in the study.  
Partner pregnancies are to be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1133042] and partner agree, the i nvestigator will follow the medical statu s of the mother, the 
pregnancy , as well as the outcome of the infant at birth, and will report the outcome to the 
Sponsor.

Version 1.0 37 22 May 2019 8.4.8. Medication Errors  
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
drug as per ins tructions in the protocol. Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories as 
follows: 
• Wrong study drug 
• Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount) 
• Wrong route of administration 
• Wrong subject  (ie, not administered to the  intended subject ) 
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study drug . 
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study drug  given per administration 
or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose accordi ng to the protocol. This also 
takes into account cumulative effects due to overdose (see Section 8.5 for treatment and reporting of overdose). For this study, any dose of vibegron of 3 or more tablets within a 24 -hour 
window is an overdose. There is no known antidote for an overdose.  
Underdose: No underdose is defined for this study. 
8.5. Treatment of Overdose  
In the event of an overdose (3 or more tablets of study drug within 24 hours), the investigator or 
treati ng physician should:  
• Contact [CONTACT_1034]’s designated Medical Monitor immediately  
• Closely monitor the subject for any AEs, SAEs, and laboratory abnormalities  
• Report all overdose events on the eCRF, whether or not the overdose is associated with an AE. I f the overdose resulted in an AE or SAE, refer to Section  10.3 for reporting 
requirements.   
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_818173]’s designated Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject .

Version 1.0 38 22 May 2019 9. Statistical Considerations  
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analyses f or this study; full details will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
9.1. Hypotheses  
9.1.1  Primary Objective and Hypothesi s 
The primary study objective is to demonstrate long-term safety of vibegron 75 mg in men with 
BPH with symptoms of OAB. There is no formal statistical primary endpoint hypothesis. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate safety endpoints , including the incidence of 
treatment -emergent AEs (SOC and PT) by [CONTACT_818174] , including events during all vibegron exposure from both Study URO-
901-[ADDRESS_1133043] has voided in the toilet as indicated on the Bladder Diary. Average daily micturitions are 
calculated using the daily entries in the Bladder  Diary, which is completed prior to each study 
visit. Average daily number of micturi tions will be calculated as the total  number of micturitions 
that occur on a Diary  Day divided by [CONTACT_818175] e Bladder Diary. Baseline 
will be the same baseline determined from the URO-901-3005 trial.  
An u rgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_165532] “Need to Urinate Immediately” as indicated on the Bladder 
Diary. Average daily urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_818149].  
A UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_818150] "urge" as  the main  reason for  the leakage as indicated on the

Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 40 22 May 2019 9.2.2. Safety Endpoints 
Safety will be assessed via clinical review of all relevant safety parameters including  AEs, 
clinical laboratory, vital sign assessments, PVR volume, and Total IPSS. 
9.3. Analysis Populations  
9.3.1. Efficacy Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set E xtension (FAS- Ext) po pulation will serve as the population for the 
analysis of efficacy data in this stu dy. Since the endpoints related to incontinence would only 
apply to subjects  who meet the defini tion of incontinence at study ent ry, it is necessary to have a 
separate FAS definition with the additional criteri on to define the analysis population for 
incontinence endpoints. 
The following FAS populations are defined in this study: 
• Full Analysis Set Extension (FAS- Ext): All OAB subjects who took at least one dose of 
vibegron in the extension study and have at least one evaluable change from baseline 
micturition measurement in this study.  
• Full Analysis  Set Extension for incontinence (FAS- Ext-I): All OAB subjects who took at 
least one dose of vibegron in the extension study, were included in the FAS -I population 
in the URO-901-[ADDRESS_1133044] one evaluable change from baseline ( ie, 
Study URO-901-3005 baseline) urge urinary incontinence measurement.  
Per-Protocol Extension population (PP-Ext) and Per-Protocol extension population for 
incontinence (PP- Ext-I) exclude subjects  due to important deviations from the protocol that may 
substantially affect the results of the efficacy endpoints. A supportive analysis using the Per 
Protocol populations will be performed for 6 efficacy endpoints as defined in Section 3 (ie, CFB 
in micturition, urgency, nocturia, and urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; IPSS Storage score; and 

Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 41 22 May 2019 volume voided per micturition). The final determ ination of protocol violations, and thereby [CONTACT_818176]-Protocol populations will be made prior to database lock  and will be 
documented. 
Using the Full Analysis Set and Per -Protocol populations, subjects will be included in one of two 
vibegron treatment groups based on the origin al randomization from the parent study (URO-901-
3005): vibegron for 52 weeks or vibegron for 28 weeks. Effi cacy endpoints will be descriptively 
summarized  by [CONTACT_1570]. 
9.3.2. Safet y Analysis Populations 
The Safety Analy sis Set - Extension (SAF -Ext) population will be used to for the analysis of 
safety data in this study.   
The SAF -Ext consists of all randomized subjects in Study URO -901-3005 who  
a) have completed the 24- week treatment  period in the Study URO -901-3005, and  
b) enrolled into the extension Study URO -901-[ADDRESS_1133045] one dose of 
vibegron in this study.   
The SAF -Ext will be used for all the safety analyses . Safety endpo ints will be descriptively 
summarized based on the treatment in study URO-901-3006. This means there will be one 
vibegron treatment group (combining 52 weeks of vibegron dosing for those continuing vibegron from Study URO -901-3005 and 28 weeks of vibegron dosing for those who received placebo in 
Study URO -901-3005 ).  
No imputation will be performed for missing safety data. Baseline will be the same as the baseline defined in the parent study. Further inclusion of data from URO-901-3005 in the reporting of this study will be described in the SAP.  
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analysis 
Statistical analysis o f efficacy endpoints will be for descriptive purposes only. Baseline will be 
defined as the baseline from the Study URO -901-3005. Further inclusion of data from URO -901-
3005 in the reporting of this study will be described in the SAP. 
For the analysis of continuous change from baseline endpoints (e g, change from baseline in 
average number of micturitions, change from bas eline in the average number of urgency 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], change from baseline in average number of nocturia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], change from baseline in 
daily urge urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], change from baseline in average IPSS Storage score, 
and change from baseline in average volume voided per micturitions), a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) with restric ted maximum likelihood estimation will be used. This 
model corrects for dropout and accounts for the fact that measurements taken on the same subject  over time tend to be correlated, by [CONTACT_818177] l available information on subjects within the 
same cov ariate  set to derive an estimate of the treatment effect for a dropout -free population.  
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 42 22 May 2019 The analysis model for each efficacy endpoint will include terms for visit, baseline, stratification 
factors  (only those that were statistically significant in UR O-901-3005 w ill be included in the 
models), and baselin e score . Only subjects on active treatment in both URO-901-3005 and URO-
901-3006 will be included in the model. Adjusted means and 95% confidence inter vals will be 
presented for each visit.   
An unstructured covar iance matrix will be used to model th e correl ation among repeated 
measurements. The Kenward -Roger adjustment will be used with restricted (or residual 
maximum likelihood (REML) to make proper st atistical inference. If the unstructured covarian ce 
model fails to converge with the default Newton- Raph son algorithm, the Fisher scoring 
algorithm or other appr opriate methods can be used to provide initial values of the covariance 
parameters. In the rare event that none of the above methods yiel d convergence, a str uctured 
covariance wi ll be used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.  
In general, continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_714806] (N), number of subjects with available data (n), arithmetic mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by N, n, number 
of subjects in each category, and the percentage of subjects in each category. Unless otherwise noted, the denominator to determine the percentage of subjects in each category will be based on the number of subjects with available data. 
9.4.2. Safety Analyses 
Safety analysis will be conducted using the SAF -Ext population and summarized by [CONTACT_818178].  The treatment -emergent period will be def ined as th e period of time 
from the first dose date of vibegron in this study through [ADDRESS_1133046] version of MedDRA (20.0 or higher). The severity of all 
adverse events will  be evaluated by [CONTACT_737]. The incidence of adverse events will be 
presented by [CONTACT_42893] c lass and preferred term , relationship to study treatment and severity.  
Laboratory data will consist of chemistry, hematolo gy and urinalysis data. Only da ta collected by 
[CONTACT_818179].   
Descriptive statistics of observed values and change from baseline for vital signs and post void 
residual urine volume will be listed and summarized . 
9.5. Multiplicity  
All efficacy endpoints will be considered descriptive and no multiplicity adjustments will be  
performed for these endpoints. 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 43 22 May 2019 9.6. Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses of endpoints may be conducted. Additional details of any planned subgroup 
analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
9.7. Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 300 subjects rolling over from Study URO-901-3005, in addition to other long-term safety data with vibegron, is sufficient to characterize the long- term safety profile of 
vibegron 75 mg once daily men with symptoms of OAB on stable doses of pharmacological 
therapy for BPH. With the assumption of approximately 33% dropout, [ADDRESS_1133047]  
One external independent DSMB will be formed for Studies URO-901-3005 and URO-901-3006. The detailed activities including meeting and analysis plan will be described and documented in the DSMB charter and the DSM B SAP, respectively.

advertisements, patient information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) wil l be submitted by [CONTACT_124541]/REB/IEC. Approval from the 
IRB/REB/IEC must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator  specifying the following:  
• Protocol number 
• Protocol version 
• Protocol date 
• Documents reviewed  
• Date on which the committee met and granted the approval  
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-3006 
 
Version 1.0 48 22 May 2019 Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/REB/IEC approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. 
The investigator will be responsible for the following: 
• Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/REB/IEC’s annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/RE B/IEC  
• Notifying the IRB/REB/IEC of SAEs  or other significant safety findings as required by 
[CONTACT_165578]/REB/IEC 
10.1.8. Source Documents  
• Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
• Data entered  in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with 
the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to 
request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Current 
medical records must be available during the site monitor’s visit.  
• The required source documents are: 
− Subject  identification (name, date of birth, sex) 
− Documentation that th e subject  meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical 
examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion 
criteria)  
− Participation in the study (including study number) 
− Study discussed and date of informed consent 
− Dates of all visits  
− Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed  
− Results of efficacy parameters, as required by [CONTACT_760]  
− Start and end date (including dose regimen) of Study Treatment (drug dispensing and return should be documented as well) 
− Record of all AEs  and other safety parameters (start and end date, and causality 
and intensity as assigned by [CONTACT_093]) 
− Concomitant medication (including start and end date) 
− Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable 
Urovant Sciences  Confidential Protocol URO-901-[ADDRESS_1133050] been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by  [CONTACT_23863]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC /REB  
or local health  authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of  subject s by [CONTACT_093] 
• Discontinuation of further study drug  development  
10.1.10. Publication Policy  
• The Sponsor has proprietary interest in this study. Authorship and manuscript composition 
will reflect joint cooperation between multiple investigators and sites and Sponsor or designee personnel. Authorship will be established prior to the writing of the manuscript. As 
this study involves multiple centers, no individual publica tions will be allowed prior to 
completion of the final report of the multicenter study except as agreed with the Sponsor. 
• The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical prac tice, the Sponsor will generally support 
publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. 
10.1.11. Compliance with Protocol  
The investigator is responsible for compliance with the protocol at the investigational site. A 
representative of the Sponsor will make frequent contact [CONTACT_78586]/her research staff and will conduct regular monitoring visits at the site to review subject  and study 
drug accountability records for compliance with the protocol. Protocol deviations will be discussed with the investigator upon identification. The use of the data collected for the subject  
will be discussed to determine if the data are to be included in the analysis. The investigator will enter data that may be excluded from  analysis as defined by [CONTACT_597691]. 
Significant protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB/IEC/REB according to the 
IRB/IEC/REB’s reporting requirements.

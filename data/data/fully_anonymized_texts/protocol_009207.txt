Protocol v. 5.0, 11/20/2020  Study Objective  
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_357031] a bidirectional oxygenation 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_357032].  
 
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that the bidirectional oxygenation mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_148062] a safe and effective respi[INVESTIGATOR_108947], 
will reduce or prevent postoperative  atelectasis, improve oxygenation  (PaO2) , improve pulmonary 
function tests, and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in cardiac surgical patients  compared 
to conventional incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_357033] . 
 
Background and Significance  
Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the princ ipal cause of morbidity, mortality and 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357034],  1-3 which results in a 50% increase in healthcare costs 
compared to postoperative cardiac complications . 4-5 This is especially evident following cardiovascular 
surgery .  Pneumonia, unplanned re -intubation and prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation (>48 
hours) remain the most concerning adverse events , with a reported incidence between 2 -5%. 4-[ADDRESS_445420] pressure (CPAP), postural drainage , incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_357035] (PEEP) .  
 
Introduced by [CONTACT_357067] a l 2,[ADDRESS_445421] -operative  patients, evidence fails to support its 
benefit.  18-23   One systematic review stated, “ Presently , the evidence does not support the use of incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_357036].”  [ADDRESS_445422] of implementing postoperative incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_357037] $1.[ADDRESS_445423] the natural propensity for these small air sacs to collapse during exhalation . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_357038], some alveoli will collapse and not be available for gas exchange.  This 
atelectasis results in a ventilation/perfusion mismatch where alveolar units are perfused but not 
adequately ventilated. This is  referred to as shunting and results in hypoxemia (decreased PaO2).

 We will also summarize patient characteristics at baseline and during follow -up using mean ± standard 
deviation (or median and interquartile range, as appropriate) for quantitative  variables and frequency 
(percentage) for categorical variables. S ummary s tatistics on Pa02  will be reported at each measurement 
occasion for each group . We will also attempt to fit a mixed effects model to examine between -group 
differences in Pa02 at each study visit. An error covariance structure most appropriate to th e data will be 
chosen. Every effort will be made to ensure complete follow -up, and to handle missed visits, missingness 
at random will be assumed. Finally, a qualitative review will also be provided, and this will include, among 
others, an evaluation of th e representativeness of the patient volunteers, a discussion on how to refine 
the data collection tools, how to improve the database, how to track patients better as well how to improve implementation of the proposed intervention.   
 
Sample Size and Accrual

out of the study may  represent a potential drawback, secondary to pain or fatigue, or evidence of 
hyperventilation and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_245034].  
 
Protection of Human Subjects  
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
Screening and enrollment will not begin  until the Emory University IRB has approved the study protocol 
and informed consent form.  
 
A physician investigator or study team designee(s) will obtain the informed consent document and verify 
the date of consent document is within the IRB approval period.  
 
A physician -investigator or study team member designee(s) will begin the informed consent process 
with the subject ≥24 hours in advance of surgery and/or study procedures when possible. This will allow the subject sufficient opportunity to consider whether  or not to participate in a study. The informed 
consent process may begin either in -person with the patient or by [CONTACT_756].  
   
7 | Page  
Protocol v. 5.0, 11/20/[ADDRESS_445434], provide a description of the study purpose, procedures, risks/benefits, alternative treatment options, and follow -up schedule. The subject will be given adequate time to fully 
understand the study, including risks and benefits and study -required follow up visi ts, and time to ask 
questions.  
 If the subject volunteers to participate in a study, he/she must verbalize understanding of the consent before he/she signs. The person obtaining informed consent will obtain all required signatures on the informed consent and HIPAA documents. The subject’s consent will be obtained before any research related procedures are performed.  
 e-Consent  
The consent process begins when a patient is screened, identified and verified as eligible for study  
participation. During the Zoom  teleconference call, a member from the study team will discuss the  
consent form in its entirety with the potential participant. The patient will be offered ample time to  
discuss the consent form with family and or friends, and have questions answered. In DocuSign,  
potential subjects have the ability to review the consent document as freely as they would if they  
were consenting in person. They also have the opportunity to exit the document without signing.  
 The process for obtaining e -consent is outlined be low:  
1. First, the IRB approved, stamped consent forms are added to an envelope in DocuSign.  
2. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (subject/coordinators) are then added to the envelope and signature [CONTACT_357072].  
3. The consent is then sent to the patient via email.  
4. Once the consent document is completed by [CONTACT_14381], a signed copy is forwarded to the  
subject via email. The completed document is also saved on the research team’s secure,  
internal shared drive.  
 
Subject Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality will be guaranteed by [CONTACT_357070] a password -protected database 
with no associated PHI or patient identifier information included. Patients in this database will only be identified via a unique study ID number. This study ID number will link the electronic data set of each patient to their PHI that will be stored separately in the research study binder.

Adverse Events  
Patients will be assessed for the following adverse events:  
1. Hypoxia (O2 saturation <85% ) 
2. CO rise 20% over baseline   
3. Increasing O2 requiremen t (non -rebreather mask, biflow, BIPAP requirement ) 
4. Reintubation

All serious adverse events will be assessed and reported per the Emory IRB Policies and Procedures.  
 
Data Collection and Monitoring  
Study data will be collected from the patient’s electronic medical records and from the local Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons  (STS)  clin ical outcomes database. All information will be entered in  a de -identified 
fashion into a password protected Microsoft E xcel spreadsheet created for the study.  All study data will 
be coded using indirect identifiers consisting of a unique numeric study ID code linked to each study participant’s name [CONTACT_357073] a, as needed.  
 Study data, including Protected Health Information (PHI), will be obtained with the patient’s direct authorization through the consent form in accordance with HIPAA policy. PHI will be obtained via  patient 
medical records  and the STS database as noted above . Permission for use or evaluation of PHI will be 
limited to the principal investigator, and research study staff. The PHI will be a part of the clinic record and patient study binder. The binders  will be kept in a secure location when not being used by [CONTACT_237766]. The PHI collected will be used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_357050], to link and confirm study data with the information located in the patient’s clinical record, and if patient safety 
necessitates, to communicate relevant findings with the patient’s healthcare providers. The PHI will be 
destroyed using the  institution’s official recycling system once the study is completed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_357051] r ecords of the study including all correspondence, the study protocol with any/all 
amendments, all correspondence with and approval from the Emory  IRB, and signed informed consent 
forms in the Regulatory Binder. All these materials, along with individual patient files, data collection forms and source data will be stored and maintained, along with a record of the location of storage, for up to [ADDRESS_445435] em. 
 
Data Management  
Upon study completion the final data set will be provided to Sponsor and stored within the secure server in the Houston Plastic Craniofacial and Sinus Surgery office ([ADDRESS_445436], Houston, TX [ZIP_CODE]). All non-identifiable patient data collected will b e stored on  a password encrypted Microsoft Excel  document

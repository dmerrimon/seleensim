1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
The subgenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex (sgACC) has been well established as a brain area sensitive to negative mood inductions and implicated in neural abnormalities associated with affective and stress disorders. It is therefore one of the primary targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment of MDD using surgically implanted DBS devices. Recent posthoc imaging studies of patients who have undergone TMS treatment for depression suggest that treatment outcomes tended to be better when patients were by [CONTACT_798497]. Based on this finding and on our own interleaved TMS/fMRI probe data, we contend that targeting delivery of TMS to the brain surface non- invasively as indicated by [CONTACT_798498]. We have used TMS/fMRI to better understand causal communication among circuits typi[INVESTIGATOR_281425] (Chen et al.,  2013). Our recent work suggests that there are specific sites that, 
when stimulated, influence subcortical brain areas implicated in affective disorders such as the sgACC. Previously, we targeted TMS based on brain atlases mapped onto individual brain surfaces. This proposal will utilize more individualized targeting from participants own resting connectivity data to guide stimulation that we show is especially effective in influencing downstream brain areas of interest. We will focus on a target region that our data suggest is particularly effective at influencing the sgACC. As an alternative brain target, we will also test the efficacy of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as a target given its precedence as 
an FDA -approved stimulation site for remediating depressive symptoms. To increase generalizability to 
other disorders and to patients with comorbid anxiety and depression (the typi[INVESTIGATOR_798487]), we will 
recruit patients who are diagnosed with PTSD  or trauma induced MDD  and who have elevated depression 
(PHQ) . We will recruit them, scan them in the MRI to get anatomical and resting fMRI data to guide TMS, 
then will invite them to participate in two rounds of two- week TMS treatment to each site (order 
counterbalanced) with approximately  one month between treatments. We will monitor depressive 
(MADRS), PTSD (PCL Checklist), and quality of life (WHOQOL) measures before, acutely after, and every month for 6 months  following TMS treatments to evaluate the effectiveness of each site in mitigating 
symptoms or improving functioning. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] , FDA -approved clinical application of TMS involves long trains 
of repetitive TMS applied for approximately 40 minutes, 5 days/week, over 2- 6 weeks, for a total of 10- 30 
TMS visits. The present  study utilizes the same FDA- approved devices (Magventure Cool- Coil B65, 
MagVenture X100 Stimulator) to administer treatment. We will be modifying the FDA -approved protocol to 
stimulate similarly  to a well-replicated protocol, theta -burst stimulation (Huang et al., 2005). We have 
attached several additional examples of prior studies which have safely utilized TMS outside of its FDA -
approved protocol, even in heightened doses. For instance, in prior studies subjects have received FDA -
approved 3000 rTMS pulses,  but done bilaterally instead of unilaterally (6000 total stimulations) every 
weekday over 4- 6 weeks (see Bakker et al., 2015). Similarly, subjects have received 3600 rTMS pulses 
every weekday over 10 days (see Chistyakov et al., 2015), or 3000 rTMS pulses every weekday over 6 weeks (see O'Reardon et al., 2007). Another study applied the FDA- approved protocol in more than a 
double- dose, with 6800 stimulations to 1 site every weekday over 7 weeks average participation (Hadley 
et al., 2013). The present study utilizes fewer stimulations than the FDA -approved protocol, with each visit 
including a maximum of [ADDRESS_1101407]  
This study will use investigat ional MagVenture devices for single- pulse and rTMS administration, including:  
 
• MagPro X100* magnetic stimulator  
• Cool-B65 Butterfly Coil  
 
The MagPro X100* magnetic stimulator and Cool -B65 Butterfly Coil are FDA -approved for rTMS treatments 
of depression.  
1.2.1  Clinical Data to Date  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Studies in Adults  
Repetitive TMS (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA -approved treatment for 
major depressive disorder. A normal, FDA -approved clinical application of TMS involves long trains of 
repet itive TMS applied for approximately 40 minutes, 5 days/week, over [ADDRESS_1101408] 
used TMS/fMRI to better understand causal communication among circuits typi[INVESTIGATOR_798488] g 
fMRI alone (Chen et al., 2013), suggesting there are specific sites that, when stimulated, influence 
subcortical brain areas implicated in affective disorders such as the sgACC.  
 This study will utilize individualized targeting from participants' own fMRI scans. We will focus on a target 
region that our preliminary data suggest is particularly effective at influencing the sgACC. As an alternative 
brain target, we will also test the efficacy of the standard dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) target.

but done bilaterally instead of  unilaterally (6000 total stimulations) every weekday over 4- 6 weeks (see 
Bakker et al., 2015). Similarly, subjects have received 3600 rT MS pulses every weekday over 10 days  (see 
Chistyakov et al., 2015), or 3000 rTMS pulses every weekday over 6 weeks (see  O'Reardon et al., 2007). 
Another study applied the FDA -approved protocol in more than a double- dose, with 6800 stimulations to 1 
site every weekday over 7 weeks average participation (Hadley et al., 2013). The present study utilizes 
many fewer stimulations than these recent/established protocols, with each visit including a maximum of

primary method for acquiring contact [CONTACT_3031].   Physician referrals and the use of the Penn Data 
Analytics Center will also be incorporated as recruitment methods.  Section 4.[ADDRESS_1101414] is comfortable 
with all study procedures. At the second study session, participants will undergo an MRI procedure for 60 minutes. This will be used to generate the TMS targets for the study . Subjects will then return every 
weekday (5 days per week , minimum of 4 days per week ) over two weeks to receive the TMS treatment  
(10 sessions) . These visits will last approximately [ADDRESS_1101415] from the study team; during the break, there will be two 
phone/survey  visits used as a safety assessment . After this break, subjects will then return every weekday 
(5 days per week , minimum of 4 days per week ) over two weeks to receive the TMS treatment  (10 sessions)  
to the other site examined in the study.  Upon completion of the study, scheduled phone and survey visits 
will take place every 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days) over the subsequent 6- month period to monitor continued stability 
of clinical improvement and/or remaining clinical symptoms.  Overall, this study consists of 1 
consent/screening visit, 1 MRI scan, 20 total visits for TMS  treatment , and 8 phone visits . 
3.1.1  Screening Pha se 
Potential participants will be recruited from the community or they may be approached by [CONTACT_798500] (see recruitment plans) to explore participant's interest in taking part in a research study. Those 
who are interested will either complete a phone screen or self -report screening form via RedCap . Those 
who pass the screen will receive an appointment to come to the research location to review the informed 
consent form and conduct the baseline diagnostic assessment screen to determine eligibil ity. Informed 
consent will be obtained upon arrival at this initial visit and before any study -related procedures are 
conducted.  All subjects will have the opportunity to ask questions before signing a consent form.  The rest

 of this initial visit will be a n extended screening, which includes a structured diagnostic interview, psychiatric 
and medical evaluation, and collection of demographic information.  Subjects will undergo a short 
demonstration of TMS to ensure that they are comfortable with all study procedures. This process involves 
adjusting the TMS device to a moderate level of stimulation and administering single pulses to the prospective TMS sites . A structured interview , Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -  DSM -

3.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoint to be analyzed in this study will  be the relationship between baseline fMRI activity 
and the clinical improvement over the course of the study in the MDD/PTSD patients.  
3.2.3  Primary Safety Endpoints  
Study follow -up will be conducted monthly, over a 6- month period upon completion of the study in order to 
determine the duration and stability of clinical improvements. In addition, a  clinical assessment will be 
conducted at the end of each 2- week administration of TMS  to any changes in  mood and/or  symptoms 
across the study as it is completed .

 4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Significant handicaps (e.g. intellectual disability) that would interfere with testing procedures  
2. MRI contraindications (e.g. foreign metallic implants, pacemaker, shrapnel or other metal in/on the 
body that  cannot be removed, claustrophobia, etc.)  
3. Addit ional TMS counter -indications (seizure disorder, CNS  active disorder, certain medications 
described below)  
4. Medication use that substantially reduces  seizure threshold to TMS (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], chlorpromazine, 
lithium) and unwilling or unable medically to safely  withdraw, at least two weeks prior  to TMS, from 
these medications

7. Known neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, encephalopathy, seizure  disorder, brain 
tumors  
8. Current problematic alcohol or substance abuse disorder, bipolar disorder  (as PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]) , 
schizophrenia or other psychotic  disorder.   
9. Refusal to agree to abstain from illicit drug use for duration of the s tudy  
10. Refusal to agree to abstain from alcohol within [ADDRESS_1101418]  patient safety or compliance (e.g. 
distance greater than 100 miles from procedure site)  
13. Currently taking psychiatric medications  
14. Newly initiated psychotherapy (less than 6 weeks)   
 
 For patients wishing to discontinue medication:  they must agree to work closely with their prescribing 
physician to wash off medications and the prescribing physician will be their point of contact [CONTACT_798503].  
4.[ADDRESS_1101419] with the research staff or by [CONTACT_798504] a screening procedure. All subjects fitting 
inclusion criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_798505]. Additional r ecruitment methods 
will include Penn media services, social media,  online advertisements (e.g. Craigslist), and fliers to be 
posted in the local communit y. 
 
This study will also utilize Facebook as a recruitment resource. The CNDS Lab account will list posts on its 
page twice a week advertising for this specific study. This account is managed by [CONTACT_798506].  
 In order to facilitate the enrollment of interested subjects in multiple studies, center -wide general pre-
screening forms phone screen and self -report screen will be used. Because t he Center for Neuromodulation 
in Depression and Stress has numerous studies that  are all closely related, in both purpose and eligibility 
criteria, a general pre- screening (both phone and self -report) has been created. Many participants will be 
eligible for multiple studies and will be presented the opportunity to participate in all studies that they are 
eligible for. An addi tional benefit of a shared or general pre- screening is that participants who do not qualify 
for a specific study can be informed of other studies they are eligible for. It will be clearly explained to all individuals that this pre -screening is for multiple studies and that their information will be stored in REDCap.  
 
Since approval of v1.0, th e center -wide prescreening has successfully increased enrollment of eligible 
participants across studies as well as significantly reduced burden on interested participants and study 
staff. The proposed modification (Sept. 2019) to the screening for m (v3.4) will update eligibility criteria to 
be more reflective of current protocols and reduce participant response burden by [CONTACT_798507], clarifying language, and implementing standard symptom severity scales. This modification (v3.4) will 
not be available to potential participants until all actively enrolling CNDS studies obtain IRB approval. Until

 that time, potential participants will continue to complete the currently approved version of the general 
screening form (v1.0).   
 
  
 
  
We will also utilize the Penn Data Store as a recruitment aid.  We will ask for a report from the PDS for 
individuals meeting our basic eligibility criteria, including a diagnosis of post -traumatic stress or adjustment 
disorder.  We will request that the r eports contain the following information: patient name, MRN, email, and 
phone; diagnosing provider & clinic name [CONTACT_798523].  We will not ask 
for the diagnosis to be listed on this form or for any other PHI.  We are only r equesting information from 
outpatient, NON -mental health clinics. As this is a sensitive population, we will be contact[CONTACT_798508].  This strategy has been 
discussed with Lauren Steinfeld (Privacy Office), David Heagerty (IRB) and Tracy Ziolek (IRB).  
 
After receiving the list from PDS, w e will then message the diagnosing providers via EPIC up to 2 times 
and attach the patient’s record each time.  EPIC messaging is a secure way to transmit PHI and all providers 
we wish to contact [CONTACT_798509].  In order to further protect patient privacy, we will not 
enter the patient’s EMR.  The patient’s information that is visible when attaching a patient’s record to an 
EPIC message is: Full Name, Age, DOB, Weight, Contact [CONTACT_7171], PCP Name, MRN, Penn Medicine 
Status, and Next Appointment Date.  
 We will require that providers give expressed approval to contact [CONTACT_798510]’s name.  We will not accept a blanket approval for all of the provider’s patients; however, we will accept a blanket request to not contact [CONTACT_798511]’s patients.  If providers give us 
permission to contact [CONTACT_75054], we will contact [CONTACT_798512], if provided, with the Patient_Email. If no email is provided, we will call the patients up to 2 times and use  the “Penn Data Store –  Cure 
Accelerator Intro” script in the Phone Screen.  
 
Student groups on campus:  We may contact [CONTACT_544396]/leaders of student groups on campus who 
potentially have members that may be able to benefit from this study.  We will not request any member 
information or attempt to contact [CONTACT_798513]; we will email the “StudentGroupEmail” (attached) 
to the chair of the group from the CNDS email account.  
 
University Student Health and Mental Health Services: We may  contact [CONTACT_798514] (including but not limited to Penn).  We will send the“StudentServices” email, addr essed 
to the providers at the clinics, requesting them to share the “StudentReferralLetter” with patients who they 
believe may benefit from this study and additionally requesting that they allow us to leave brochures or flyers within their clinics.   
 
We w ill also list this study on our laboratory website at https://www.med.upenn.edu/cnds/

5 Study Intervention (Study drug, device,  biologic, vaccine, food etc.) 
5.1 Description 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non- invasive form of brain stimulation. TMS can influence 
activity in various brain regions, and it allows researchers to test or modify brain circuit communication. Th is 
study will employ the following investigational devices:  
• MagPro X100* magnetic stimulator  
• Cool-B65 Butterfly Coil  
 
The MagPro X100* magnetic stimulator and Cool B -[ADDRESS_1101421] stimulation (TBS; Huang et al., 2005), which involves triplets of 
TMS pulses at 50Hz, with intermittent breaks. The intermittent TBS (iTBS) protocol involves [ADDRESS_1101422]  an approximate 20- minute break 
before a second 7-minute block of iTBS resumes. Therefore, each stimulation session will involve <[ADDRESS_1101423] site for TMS 
treatment. This site is determined by [CONTACT_798515] 6 cm anterior to 
motor cortex in a parasagittal line. Targeting for a second site in this study, a sub- region of the DLPFC that 
we refer to as the fMRI -guided target or  LPFC, involves the use of a prior MRI scan to determine the site 
of stimulation.  Structural MRI data will be use d to specifically identify the LPFC on each individual’s brain. 
Functional MRI data will further specify the exact location of stimulation, as the precise target for stimulation 
will be region that demonstrates the greatest activity  during functional MRI scanning. 
5.3 Storage  
All interventional devices are owned, stored, and managed by [CONTACT_798516] (CNDS). All devices are stored behind locked doors with restricted access to members of the CNDS. These devices are located at the CNDS lab- space in the Richards Biomedical 
Building.  
5.4 Blinding  
The administering clinician  will be blinded as a part of this study.  All subjects will receive TMS to both 
stimulation sites ( fMRI -guided target/  DLPFC) as a part  of this study in 2- week intervals. The order of site 
of stimulation is randomized and counterbalanced.  
5.5 Administration and Accountability    
Staff will be trained on the protocol and inclusion/exclusion criteria. TMS protocols will be administered by [CONTACT_281438] -trained staff in the CNDS . All TMS staff will be trained by [CONTACT_978] (Desmond Oathes, Ph.D.) and 
the Center Director (Yvette Sheline, M.D. ). These procedures are in accordance with the "Safety, ethical 
considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research" (Rossi et al., 2009).  MRI scans will be conducted by [CONTACT_798517] (CAMRIS).

 6.2 Study Intervention Phase  
6.2.1  Visit 1 (sometimes referred to as the baseline visit)  
Visit 1 (aka Baseline) will take approximately 2- [ADDRESS_1101425] time limitations, we may provide 
the option to complete the clinical assessments remotely (by [CONTACT_648]/ sending the surveys) or to split the 
visit in two visits . If any of these adjustments are made, we will make a note in their records. At the first 
study session, subjects will complete 60 minutes of structural MRI and resting- state fMRI scans. Structural 
and functional scans will be obtained in each session on a clinically -approved 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma 
(Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]) scanner, equipped with 40mT/m gradients and 200 mT/m/s slew -rates. RF 
transmission will use a quadrature body -coil, and reception will use a Siemens receive- only 64- channel 
head coil. The total time in the scanner will be approximately 60 minutes. An experienced technician and a member of the study team will be present during the MR session to ensure participant safety and well-
being.  
 Additionally, clinical assessments of thoughts, mood, and behaviors will be completed. Subjects  will 
complete the following neurocognitive assessments  during this visit : 
i. Nback task: C omputerized task to measure working memory capacity.  
ii. Trails A & B task: Computerized task  of visual attention and task switching
. 
iii. Stroop/Word t ask: Neurophysiological testing of cognitive interference.  
iv. Foraging task: Computerized test to measure reward seeking behaviors.  
 
In collaboration with Arjun Ramakrishnan from the Platt Lab, EEG data will be collected when the 
participants are engaged in the above- mentioned tasks.  We may also record the location of their gaze at 
any particular time during these tasks using a passive eye- tracking dev ice. The eyetracker will use a camera 
to identify the position of the pupil and cornea (using near -infrared reflection). By [CONTACT_798518], we can obtain information about what subjects attended to during their decisions, for how long they attended to it, and in what order they attended to it.

the clinical assessments remotely (by [CONTACT_648]/ sending the surveys) and we will make a note in their records. 
Brain data from the MRI scan (stimulation target in individualized brain space) will be calibrated with the skin and scalp using a Polaris Vicra camera (Brainsight neuronavigation) to allow marking of the stimulation sites. In addition, subjects will be evaluated to determine their motor threshold, or the amount of stimulation 
at the motor cortex needed to create an involuntary thumb twit ch. This preparation time is expected to take 
approximately [ADDRESS_1101428] stimulation (. TBS 
will be administered twice per session, with approximately a 20 minute break between each round of TMS . 
Participants will complete a short clinical assessment before and after each TBS session.  
 During the break between TMS rounds, participants will  either complete  a working memory task  or watch 
a peaceful video; . These tasks are being added to the study protocol in order to activate brain areas through 
which the TMS treatments are expected to enhance relaxed mood (nature videos) or increase cognitive control (nback working memory task).  Randomization will be by [CONTACT_798519] (age,  race, gender) to balance the groups later in the study, as necessary.  
 During TMS, subjects will be asked to sit still for approximately seven minutes at a time when TBS is 
administered. The total number of stimulations in each TBS block is [ADDRESS_1101429] time limitations, we may provide the option  to complete the  clinical 
assessments remotely (by [CONTACT_648]/ sending the surveys), and we will make a note in their records. TBS 
sessions  are expected to take approximately 1 ½ hours, except for Visit #11 and visit #[ADDRESS_1101430] EEG and ey etracking data, as in the Baseline Visit.  
. 
 
We may  use Neuroflow software for recording participants’ heart rate during each TMS treatment session. 
NeuroFlow's  software platform analyzes data from a commercially available, third- heart rate monitor. 
NeuroFlow follows strict HIPAA guidelines with respect to patient privacy and data security, both from a technical and administrative respective.  Only de- identified data will be recorded using this platform, no 
identifiers will be entered on the platform.  
 Participants will have a [ADDRESS_1101431] set of TMS sessions (i.e., Visit 
2-11/Weeks 1 & 2) and the second set of TBS sessions (i.e., Visits 13 -23/Weeks 6 & 7).  During this time, 
participants will not be coming into the lab.  However, participants will be scheduled for two phone/survey 
visits approximately one week, and two weeks (+/ - 3 days) following Visit #11, in which clinical as sessments 
will be completed.  
 Due to the nature of TMS treatment, daily visits are necessary. In the event a participant misses a session, 
the participant may complete two TMS treatment sessions on one day with ample time in between. In this 
case, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_798490]. If too many sessions are missed (as per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]), the 
participant may be withdrawn from the study without their consent.  
6.2.3  3 week break & Phone Calls  
Participants will have a [ADDRESS_1101432] set of TBS sessions (i.e., Visit 
2-11/Weeks 1 & 2) and the second set of TBS sessions (i.e., Visits 1 3-22/Weeks 6 & 7).  During this time, 
participants  will not be coming into the lab.  However, participants will be scheduled for two phone calls and

round of TMS treatments  Please see sections 6.2.2 for further explanation on these visits.  
 
6.2.5  6 Month Follow -Up: Phone Calls  
Upon completion of the study, scheduled phone and survey visits will take place every 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days) 
over the subsequent 6- month period to monitor continued stability of clinical improvement and/or remaining 
clinical symptoms.  Each phone and survey  visit will include clinical assessments and will take approximately 
30-[ADDRESS_1101434] Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time. They may also be discontinued from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to intervention, study procedures, or visit schedule. The 
Investigator or the Sponsor (if applicable) may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan or to 
protect the subject for reasons of safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not 
each subject completes the study.  No tapering proc edure with TBS is necessary or required in the event 
that a subject withdraws from this study.  
6.4 Pregnancy Testing  
Consistent with clinical care standards  for MRI scanning, attestation of pregnancy status will be accepted 
at the time of MRI screening.  In add ition, attestation of pregnancy status will be requested prior to TMS 
treatment.

• Montgomery -Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS)  
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)  
• Positive and Negative Affect Schedules ( PANAS - 20 item)  
• World Health Organization Quality of Life ( WHOQOL -BREF ) 
• Snaith -Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)  
 
6.7 Safety Evaluations  
Only individuals trained by [CONTACT_189451] (Desmond Oathes, Ph.D.) and Center Director (Yvette 
Sheline, M.D.) will dispense TMS. The licensed physician (Sheline, M.D. or a suitable medically trained 
stand- in) will closely sup ervise any medical instability in patients and will specifically be responsible for 
training and overseeing syncope and seizure management which are not expected given our screening 
process but are the two primary health risks with TMS treatment.  
 
[CONTACT_798525] ine, a board certified physician, will review all questionable screens for MRI and TMS safety and 
will be physically present (or a reasonable medically trained stand- in) for every TMS session conducted on

Site x Time ANOVA for pre- treatment compared with the 6 month timepoint to explore the degree of 
maintenance of treatment benefits.  
7.4.1  Baseline Data  
After 10 participants are randomly assigned to each stimulation order, an analysis of demographic data 
(age, education, gender, symptom severity) will address any initial differences in baseline characteristics of 
the two samples. If there is a systematic difference, randomization will be temporarily suspended to assign 
patients to one or other of the two groups in order to re- balance the initial baseline characteristics of the 
two groups. [Independent samples t -tests for continuous variables and Chi -square for categorical variables]

will also be assessed at this interval and if the team decides that the procedures are safe and appropriate, enrollment will continue up to [ADDRESS_1101441] detailed information collected on adverse events throughout 
the study duration, and this information will be used for the overall study safety analysis.  These factors will 
include: worsening of symptoms, development of new psychiatric s ymptoms, medical effects (syncope, 
seizure, or other), and any equipment failures.  
7.[ADDRESS_1101442] Population(s) for Analysis  
All data collected from enrolled subjects, who meet the eligibility criteria and complete, at minimum, baseline 
assessments  will be analyzed. In the event that a subject does not complete the full study, their completed 
time-points may still be used in analyses, such as characterizing baseline fMRI activity and symptom 
severity. Any subjects enrolled into the study  and meeting the eligibility criteria,  regardless of whether they 
received investigational product, may be included in these analyses.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that the Princi pal Investigator 
determines as significantly worse during course of the study .  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be 
regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse 
events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
• is considered by [CONTACT_404550]:  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use if  a drug in humans 
whether or not considered drug related.  
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_798491]. All serious events (SAE) will be reported to the IRB: a)  Death: immediately b) Life- threating and all other SAEs within 7 calendar days. Should there 
be a serious event that occurs that increases the risks to the participants the study will be stopped, an investigation will be conducted, and a findings report will be generated before the study is resumed.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The relationship of each adverse event to the study procedures will be characterized. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_798492] (definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely, or unrelated).  
8.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Prob lems  
This study will comply with the Penn IRB
 definition of reportable events and reporting timelines. The 
investigators and the protocol sponsor will conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible. Additionally all other events 
(unantici pated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device effects and subject complaints  
will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal policies as described in the Penn 
Manual . 
  
8.4.1  Follow -up report 
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 8.4.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse 
event, will be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event.  To report such 
events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by [CONTACT_563762] [ADDRESS_1101443] the understanding of the 
event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the 
study sponsor.  
8.4.3  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB  
In compliance with the University of Pennsylvania reporting requirements and timelines, the principle 
investigator ([CONTACT_798526]) will submit reports within 10 working days of discovery (with one exception) for 
events that meet reporting criteria. If the adverse event involved a death and indicates that participants or others are at increased risk of harm, the investigator will submit a report to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1101444] enough information to complete the Reportable Event form within this timeframe, he will still submit a Reportable Event Form. In such cases, a follow up report will be provided 
once additional information has been obtained.

any participant who indicates greater than minimal risk for experiencing syncope or a seizure in response 
to TMS which are the primary medical risk s for this procedure. It is the responsibility of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_798493]. Sheline and other collaborating 
medical staff . This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate r eporting of adverse 
events as noted above.  
 
Participants will meet the clinician  treating them at each TMS treatment visit where they also report on their 
current symptoms.  During the 3 week break, we also call them to assess symptom changes.  Substantial  
worsening of symptoms to the point of potential threat determined by [CONTACT_5989] (Sheline) and PI 
(licensed psychologist) will result in a threat assessment of the patient which, depending on the degree of 
worsening, will facilitate: brief de- esca lation interventions, request for self -admit to nearest emergency 
room, request for family/friend accompaniment to ER, or a call to emergency services for patient pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049].  
The procedures are all done within walking distance of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Penn 
Medicine , which will be the first choice for emergency services if the patient is ambulatory and willing to 
accompany study staff to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_798494] .  
 If the patient endorses a significant worsening of symptoms that is abnormal for their typi[INVESTIGATOR_798495] a category of imminent risk for self -harm, their participation will be discontinued.  
8.5.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Pla n 
Monitor Selection: One monitor will be assigned for this study and will be responsible to complete the 
monitoring process. The monitor will be a research coordinator at the center who is not the lead research 
coordinator for this study. An updated CV wil l be kept on file in the Research Personnel regulatory binder 
to document the qualifications of the monitor.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL

identify ing potential adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_19288], making adjustments accordingly, 
and reporting the experience. The P.I. is responsible for tracking these reports and relaying them as required to the IRBs and other investigators. Data integri ty, safety, and privacy will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_281431].  
 The following activities will be completed by [CONTACT_281448]:  
• Ensure all data has been reviewed and collected;  
• Confirm all reports of unanticipated problems have been reported to the IRB(s);  
• Review the regulatory documentation and subject files for completeness and compliance with all 
applicable federal regulations ; 
• Ensure that all continuing review reports were submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_1201](s);  
• Review requirements for record retention with the investigator and the clinical staff.  
 
The checklist will be signed by [CONTACT_798521]. 
8.5.[ADDRESS_1101446] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect 
at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Staff will be trained on the protocol and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Other facilities will include various 
laboratory spaces specializing in advanced computing and analysis  of neuroimaging and cognitive 
datasets.  
 Structural and functional scans will be obtained in each session on a clinically -approved 3 Tesla Siemens 
Prisma (Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]) scanner  housed in the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
and Spectroscopy (CAMRIS), equipped with 40mT/m gradients and 200 mT/m/s slew -rates. RF 
transmission will use a quadrature body -coil, and reception will use a Siemens receive- only 64- channel 
head coil. The total time i n the scanner will be approximately 60 minutes. All MRI imaging will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_28906]. Additional MRI resources, such as a mock scanner, may be accessed from the 
Center for Functional Neuroimaging (CfN).

11.1 Risks  
There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  
 
Clinical Interview and Assessment: Some discomfort may be associated with the clinical assessments 
conducted in this study. Participants may experience emotional discomfort when answering some questions 
CONFIDENTIAL

 in the quest ionnaires or when talking about  personal information. Participants may choose not to answer 
any of the questions and to terminate their  participation.  
 
MRI scan: Likely/Common: Subjects may experience claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces and/or 
anxious feelings accompanied by [CONTACT_28926]) within the MRI  scanner. In addition, 
the scanner produces a loud repetitive knocking noise during the study that some people find bothersome. 
If a subject has a problem with feeling uncomforta ble while inside the scanner,  they may stop this study. 
To lessen the noise, earplugs will be provided.  
 
Rare: Implanted medical  devices and metallic foreign fragments inside the body may pose a risk if a subject 
were to enter the MRI magnet room. Devices  such as Pacemakers, Internal Cardiac Defibrillators, Insulin 
Pumps, and other medical devices may also prevent a safe MRI. Therefore, questions regarding medical 
and work  history will be asked prior to your exam. Patients who have metallic devices in thei r bodies will 
not be permitted to be scanned using MRI. There are no known risk factors associated with MRI scans for  
healthy subjects. Although there are no known risks related to MRI on pregnant women or a fetus, there is 
a possibility of yet undiscovered pregnancy related risks. Since there is no possible benefit from 
participating in this protocol for a pregnant woman, we will exclude pregnant women.  
Consistent with clinical care standards  for MRI scanning, attestation of pregnancy status will be accepted 
at the time of MRI screening.  Some people may  find the MRI  to be uncomfortable and claustrophobic. 
Participants will be instructed to inform the doctor  ordering the scan, or the study staff, if they suffer from 
claustrophobia. The MRI scanner produces  different types of noises during a scan. Since the noise level 
can be loud, participants may be given special earplugs to reduce the noise. A MRI scanner has a strong 
magnet which attracts certain metals.  If anyone has these types of metal in their body, t he MRI's strong 
magnetic field can cause them to move which may cause injury. The MRI will not be performed on anyone 
having these types of metal in  their body. To prevent an injury, participants will be asked questions or given 
a form requesting  informati on about any metal in their body and if they work with metals. Some dyes in 
tattoos and permanent eyeliner contain metals which may move during the MRI scan causing the area with 
the tattoo to become irritated and swollen. No metal objects are allowed to be brought into the MRI scan  
room at any time, because the MRI magnet will quickly and strongly pull those items into the scanner.  To 
prevent any injury to patients and staff and any damage to the MRI scanner, participants will be asked to 
remov e all jewelry and clothing containing metal before you enter the MRI scan room. Also,  since the MRI 
magnet will erase credit cards, they must not be taken into the scan room. Once participants are positioned 
in the scanner, the door to the room will be closed to prevent anyone with any metal object entering the 
scan room.  
 TMS: TMS is considered to be a low -risk procedure. The only  common side effect of TMS (approx 25% of 
patients) is a mild headache. There are no known significant risks with this procedur e at this time because 
the magnetic fields at the strengths used are thought to be without harm. For a normal healthy person, 
producing a seizure from TMS in this  experiment is very unlikely. There has been only one reported seizure 
in the history of theta- burst  stimulation studies (Rossi et al., 2009). There are no known long- term adverse 
effects reported with the  use of this device. Rarely, device malfunction could result in a scalp burn. There 
may be unforeseen  risks in the long- term that are currently u nknown. The TMS device produces a clicking 
sound. Although studies have found no hearing impairments as a result of this sound, some subjects 
experience a mild temporary effect on their hearing. To minimize this possibility, subjects will be given 
protecti ve earplugs or headphones.  
 EEG: The EEG procedures are safe and have been in use for decades in both clinical and basic research 
settings. There are no known major risks associated with t his procedure. Some people may experience a 
mild headache or discomfort  when wearing the headset  and completing the computerized tasks . Very 
rarely, seizures have been reported during EEG recordings for individuals with a preexisting condition of seizure disorder. Subjects who experience any discomfort will be encouraged to withdraw from the EEG 
component of the study.  Subjects  with a known history of seizures  are not be eligible for the study.  
 Eyetracking device:  The eyetracking device feels and looks li ke regular eye glasses. Subject can move 
their eyes, head, and body as normal. No discomfort is expected during the procedure.

 11.2 Benefits  
There is no promise of benefit to subjects in this study. MDD/PTSD  subjects may benefit by a reduction in 
symptoms from treatment with TBS. There is no benefit for  receiving the MRI scans or for  the clinical 
assessments.  The scans and the clinical assessments are performed only for research, and the results 
are not routinely shared with participants. However, in the event that clinically significant MRI abnormalities are discovered, subjects will be informed of the finding and referred to their physician. An indirect benefit of participating in this study is contributing to scientific knowledge. This study has the potential  to greatly 
increase our knowledge of treatment mechanisms  in people with MDD/PTSD and may lead to new 
treatment standards in the future. 
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
This study is minimal risk. There is essentially zero risk of harm from the research procedures (MRI, TMS,  
EEG, eyetracking device,  assessments of symptoms). The potential individual benefit from the study 
treatments, and the potential benefits  to society through the increased understanding of treatment methods 
in MDD /PTSD, outweigh  the potential risk from the MRI and TMS procedures. Additionally, those who would 
be unable to tolerate TMS or an MRI scan will be screened out.  
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Prior to any study visits, all subjects will verbally consent to a telephone screen ing interview with a trained 
member of the study staff.  Informed consent will be obtained upon arrival by a qualified research coordinator 
before any study -related procedures are conducted.  This consenting process will take place in a private  
room at the CNDS lab- space at the University of Pennsylvania to protect the patients’ privacy. All subjects 
will be reminded to ask questions before signing a consent form, and all subjects will receive a copy of the 
signed consent form to keep for their own documentation.  
11.4.1  Alterations to Typi[INVESTIGATOR_48476] (only include if applicable)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Waiver of Consent (In some cases for screening/portions of that study that qualify as 
minimal risk, a waiver of documentatio n of consent may be permissible per IRB SOP s) 
This study will involve a waiver of documentation of consent  for the telephone screening procedure in this 
protocol . This waiver will permit coordinating study staff to conduct a telephone screening interview with 
potential research subjects prior to any  study visits.  
 This process involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. In addition, the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. Furthermore, the research could not practicably be 
carried out without this waiver or alteration. Finally, whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided 
with additional pertinent information after participation.  
12 Study Finances  
12.1 Funding Source  
This study is financed through a grant from CureAccelerator (Cures Within Reach) and the Kahlert Foundation. Additional support (co-funding) will be provided by [CONTACT_798522] . 
 Compensation for the EEG and eyetracking procedures of this study, done in collaboration with Arjun 
Ramakrishnan,  is funded separately  through [CONTACT_798528]’s grant  (the 2018 NARSAD Young 
Investigators Grant, grant number [ZIP_CODE]).  
12.[ADDRESS_1101448] Stipends or Payments  
Subjects will receive $30 for completion of the MRI procedure. All TMS treatment is free to patients as a 
part of the study.  During the Baseline, Visit #11 and Visit #23 if participants complete the EEG and 
eyetracking recording procedure, they will receive a total of 75$ (25$ per  visit) at the end of the study.  
Therefore, subjects will receive a grand total of  $105  if they participate in the EEG/eyetracking procedures 
and MRI. If subjects prefer not complete the EEG/eyetracking recordings, they will receive $[ADDRESS_1101449] transportation assistance will receive up to $10.[ADDRESS_1101450] (similar to a debit/credit card) which allows funds to be available immediately. 
Study staff will provide participants with a ClinCard Cardholder FAQ: US  document (attached). Subjects 
will receive compensation at the end of their study completion. Subjects  who do not feel comfortable with 
the Greenphire ClinCard may be compensated by a check, in lieu of  the ClinCard. We are not stating this 
option in the ICF, as we would prefer all participants to use the ClinCar d for consistency; however, we 
acknowledge that not all individuals will feel comfortable with this method and therefore, if during the 
consenting process or at any time during the study, a participant  expresses discomfort, we will then verbally 
offer them the option of being paid with a check.  We will add a note to file for each subject that receives 
compensation in the form of a check instead of a C linCard.

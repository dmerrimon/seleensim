 3 1.0 BACKGROUND  
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the gold standard for non -invasive measurement of resting 
myocardial blood flow ( rMBF)  and stress myocardial blood flow (sMBF) (1,2) .  Measurements of 
MBF by [CONTACT_637474] -82 (Rb -82), nitrogen -13 ammonia (N -13) or oxygen -
[ADDRESS_852051] invasive measurements via doppler  velocity 
and flow wires.  The  constellation of data  has valid ated the upper limits of rMBF and sMBF in 
healthy, young volunteers as well as the lower limits in tissue with transmural myocardial infarctions 
(MI)(3-8).  Furthermore, test-retest methodological precision of global PET myocardial perfusion by 
[CONTACT_637475] a standard infusion bolus as measured of a 2D PET 
scanner is ±10%. (9)  Rb-82 and N -13 are the only FDA approved radiopharmaceuticals for 
myocardial perfusion  imaging.  Currently, Rb -82 is the preferred radiopharmaceutical at Ochsner .  
Given Rb-82’s ultra-short half -life of 76 seconds, quantification of MBF poses significant challenges 
on contemporary 3D PET system s.   
An estimated 95% of installed PET scanners are used mainly for whole -body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG) oncology applications. Therefor e, these systems have not been designed historically with the 
performance specifications required to achieve accurate MBF quantification and to maintain high  
quality myocardial perfu sion imag ing.  As opposed to most clinical PET applications that perform 
static imaging at some delayed time after the tracer biodistribution has stabilized, MBF quantification 
requires the acquisition of dynamic images starting immediately from time of tracer adminis tration and 
including the biophysical distribution process.   
 
During early time phase of the acquisition, almost all tracer activity is concentrated in a small bolus 
of the venous system contained within the scanner field of view resulting in very high de tector count  
rates that risk saturating the photon detection and processing subsystems. In contrast, during late 
  
 4 phases of the acquisition, the activity is distributed widely throughout the body tissues, and only a 
small fraction of the administered activi ty resides within the heart and adjacent organs in the scanner 
field of view .  Furthermore, for short -lived tracers such as 82Rb, the isotope activity will decay  
several half -lives over the course of imaging. Consequently, late - phase count  rates  (perfusio n 
images)  can be orders of magnitude lower than those of the early -phase, risking low -quality perfusion 
images that are noisy and require the use of smoothing filters at the expense of spatial resolution and 
image contrast (10).  Therefore, for each 3D camera, there is an ideal range of administered Rb-82 
activity such that detector saturation is avoided,  and perfusion images are diagnostic (11).  
 
Furthermor e, during 3D acquisition, there is significant scatter and random detections that are 
corrected for within the sub -processing systems.  These events occur much more freq uently with 
higher activities and are non -linear with decay .  Hence, with short lived tracers suc h as Rb -82, the 
scatter and random corrections must occur at short intervals (5 -10 seconds)  and images created from  
the summ ed scatter and random corrected intervals (12).  The necessary processes to achieve accurate 
and diagnostic images requires a tremendous amount of computational power  and time.  
 
Reconstruction times on f irst generation 3D PET/CT  could take ~45  minutes per dataset when  using 5 
second intervals .  Therefore, a 3/9/22  Rb-82 infusion profile (20mls/min) was developed : 1) to 
mitigate scatter and the lengthy processing time  2) to mitigate detector saturation  3) to maintain 
diagnostic quality  perfusion images  4) to obtain accurate MBF data . However, on modern day 3D 
PET/CT scanners with fast er internal components and improved processing speeds, the necessity of 
the low flow profile vs. the standard profile (50mls/min  bolus ) is under debate.  We seek to test these 
profiles on [ADDRESS_852052] populations  of volunteers .  
 
 
  
 5 2.0 Rationale and Hypothes es  
As perfusion metrics in the healthy volunteers, patients with risk factors and/or coronary artery 
disease and in tissue with transmural myocardial infarctions  has been well defined (13) AND same 
day test -retest variability  minutes apart using a bolus infusion is ±10%(9), we shall test [ADDRESS_852053] coefficient of varia tion (COV) of whole heart 
rMBF and sMBF  acquired using a bolus  on a modern 3D PET scanner falls within  ± 10%.  The 
second hypothesis is repeated same day test -retest COV  of whole heart rMBF and sMBF acquired 
using a low flow profile  on a modern 3D PET scanner  falls within ± 10%.  The third hypothesis is 
COV of whole heart rMBF and sMBF between bolus and low flow  profile is ± 10% where the bolus 
is considered the standard  on a modern 3D PET scanner . 
The above testing and hypotheses deal with precision of MBF measurement s however do es not 
address accuracy .  Measuring a ccuracy of non -invasive MBF measurements poses significant 
challenges as a “gold standard” for comparison in not realistically achievable  in a clinical setting .   
Invasive measurements would pose unnecessary  risk for patients and non-invasive “gold standard” 
measurements would require a standardized “ phantom pump ” which is not available  within industry.  
Instead, PET lab s have traditionally relied on patient populations to determine accuracy.   As such, 
this study w ill not test nor is it powered to answer questions regarding accuracy.  As the PET camera 
is currently being installed  and testing prior  to a “clinical go -live” is preferable  to ensure measured 
flow metrics are consistent with the literature , as part of quality assurance , testing  of the above 
hypotheses  will also allow us to make additional observations to : 
1) Confirm healthy volunteers  measured  rMBF and sMBF  fall within published ranges  
(rMBF  0.69-1.06 cc/min/g and sMBF>2.17cc/min/g)  .(13) 
2) Confirm clinical volunteers with risk factors and/or CAD  measured rMBF and sMBF fall 
within published ranges  (rMBF  0.50-1.10 cc/min/g  and sMBF  >1.09 to 2.17 
cc/min/g) .(13) 
  
 6 3) Confirm rMBF  in regions of infarct in volunteers with prior large myocardial infarctions 
fall within published ranges  (rMBF <0.45 cc/min/g with minimum  <0.19 cc/min/g) .(14)

 9 5.0 Study Procedures  
 
All “normal” participants eligible for inclusion  will have initial screening  by [CONTACT_74562]/or 
research physicians. Initial s creening will consist of an assessment of the volunteer’s  medical history, 
a manual blood pressure  (BP)  measurements , height and weight measurements and when appropriate 
waist to hip ratio,  and venipu ncture for fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], basic metabolic profile and nicotine .  If the 
“normal” volunteer has results for any of the required laboratory testing within the past 90  days, 
venipuncture  will not be required.  Inform ed consent will be obtained if venipuncture is required.  
Exclusion from the study will result if  the “normal” volunteer :   
• is noted to have any chronic systemic medical condition on interview  
• has a manual SBP 130 or DBP 80.   
• Has an “abnormal” lipid profile. A “normal” lipid profile is defined as  a total cholesterol 
200 and LDL 130 and TG200 and HDL 40.  Volunteers with values outside of these 
defined norms will be deemed “abnormal”  
• has detectible nicotine levels.  
• BMI>30 OR BMI >25 and <[ADDRESS_852057] -to-hip ratio  >0.9 in men and >0.80 in women  
 
If the “normal” volunteer is excluded based on results of the initial screen, she/he could meet 
inclusion criteria for “clinical”.  If the “normal” volunteer is not excluded based o n results of the 
initial screen, informed consent for participation in the research study in addition to consent for the 
research PET scan will be obtained.  Once informed consent is obtained the patient will be scheduled 
for the research PET scan.  On the  day of the PET scan and as part of the PET scan protocol, IV 
access will be placed.  At that time, a blood sample will be obtained and sent for caffeine levels.  
Female volunteers will also undergo urine pregnancy testing on the day of the scan.  If the p regnancy 
test is positive, the patient will be excluded.  The volunteer will than undergo pharmacologic PET 
stress testing per the attached protocol using a standard weight -based dosing of dipyridamole.  Once 
the PET stress scan is completed, the volunteer ’s participation is completed.  
  
 10 All “clinical” and “infarct” participants eligible for inclusion will have initial screening by [CONTACT_63137]/or research physicians. Initial screening will consist of an assessment of the volunteer’s 
medical history and prior PET studies (infarcts).  If the “clinical” or “infarct” volunteer is not 
excluded based on results of the initial screen, informed consent for participation in the research study 
in addition to consent for the research PET scan will be obtained.  Once informed consent is obtained  
the patient will be scheduled for the research PET scan.  On the day of the PET scan and as part of the 
PET scan protocol, IV access will be placed.  At that time, a blood sample will be obtained and sent 
for caffeine levels.  Female volunteers will also undergo urine pregnancy test (if appropriate) on the 
day of the scan.  If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient will be excluded.  The volunteer will 
than undergo pharmacologic PET stress testing per the attached protocol using a standard weight -
based dosing of dipyridamole. Once the PET stress scan is completed, the volunteer’s participation is 
completed.  
 
 
 
 

  
 11 6.0 Measurements  of Myocardial Blood Flow  
Base line absolute coronary flow, CFR and coronary flow capacity will be obtained for each major 
coronary artery territory [left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCx), right coronary 
(RCA)] using FDA -approved software  HeartSee  for each scan obtained.  For the “infarct” group, 
region of interests will be drawn around the infarct territory where  average and minimum resting 
myocardial blood flow will be determined for each scan.  
 
7.0 Statistical Analysis  
This is a measurement reliability study in a 2x2 factorial design. Study factors are infusion 
flow rate (20 or 50) at rest and stress . The linear nature of data acquisition takes about [ADDRESS_852058]:  three rest ing values and [ADDRESS_852059] 2 resting  values and the 2 stress values condition are obtained in a cross -
over fashion by [CONTACT_637478] (infusion level assigned randomly for first resting scan and 
for first stress scan).  The third resting value will be obtained at either a 20 or 50 infusion 
flow rate and will be used to determine  precision (test -retest variability)  against the same 
infusion profile obtained  in the first two infusions.   
Precision and variability will be  determined for globa l, average quadrant, and individual 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_637470], stress flow and CFR.  Standard summary statistical tests w ill be  
used. Applicable tests are 2-tailed, and p  < 0.[ADDRESS_852060] (PRP). Paired or unpaired Student  t test will be  used to evaluate continuous variables 
where appropriate. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_26048] -Morgan  F test will be  used to test for differences in 
variability of perfusion between groups.  To compare the histogram distribution between 
groups of stress perfusion and CFR for each of 1344 pi[INVESTIGATOR_637471] -
  
 12 coded ranges of coronary flow capacity, we will use  the Kolmogorov -Smirnov (KS) test for 
differ ences in histogram distribution.

9.0 Radiation Risks  
Participants who enroll in the study will receive ionizing radiation.  The effective dose of a cardiac 
PET scan is approximately 6.2 mSV or less.  This is about 12% of the occupational exposure allowed 
for a radiation worker.  This is also about twice the annual amount of natural backgro und radiation 
exposure.  
 
10.0       Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Participants opting to withdraw from the study will not have the PET scan performed.  
 
11.0     Privacy/Confidentiality Issues

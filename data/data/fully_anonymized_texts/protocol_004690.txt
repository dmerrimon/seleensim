cancer deaths in 2005; although the incidence has increased for several decades, the mortality 
rate has decreased (1). The introduction of effective th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including chemotherapy, 
hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_184570], has been a major factor contributing to improved 
outcomes (2).  
The link between the endocrine system and br east cancer was first recognized more than [ADDRESS_488094] cancer (3).  It is now 
established that estrogen stimulates the growth  of some breast tumors; thus, hormone-sensitive 
breast cancer can be effectively treated with ag ents that reduce estrogen stimulation of the 
estrogen receptor.  Since the late 1970s, numerous clinical trials have shown that the selective 
estrogen receptor (SERM) antagonist tamoxifen is  as effective for the initial treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer as other hormonal therap ies or chemotherapy but with fewer secondary 
effects in women with hormone receptor positive tumors (4,5) .  As a result, tamoxifen became 
the gold standard for first-line treatment for hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer. In 
contrast to tamoxifen, which inhibits the activity of estrogen by [CONTACT_389497], aromatase inhibitors (AIs) bloc k the conversion of androgens to estrogens and 
reduce estrogen levels in tissue and plasma. Third-generation AIs include the nonsteroidal 
inhibitors letrozole and anastrozole and the steroidal inhibitor exemestane. With daily oral administration, anastrozole and exemestane inhibit aromatase activity in vivo by [ADDRESS_488095] years, the aromatase 
inhibitors (AIs) have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials. As first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer, third-generation AIs are equivalent or superior to tamoxifen. Women 
with  metastatic breast cancer who were given letrozole as first-line treatment had a significantly higher response rate, a significantly longer time to  progression, and a significant improvement in 
one and two-year survival rates, as compared with women given tamoxifen. Thus, these agents have been demonstrated to be more effective than tamoxifen in the metastatic setting with less secondary effects and they are now considered the first line therapy in postmenopausal patients 
with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.    
- Adjuvant Hormonal therapy for early breast cancer in postmenopausal women 
The proven efficacy of hormonal therapy in metasta tic disease also made it the ideal test agent 
for adjuvant hormonal therapy in early stage operable breast cancer (6). In the 1980’s the use of 
tamoxifen expanded as adjuvant therapy for early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer 
reducing reoccurrences by 47% and the risk of death by 26% among patients with hormone-
receptor-positive breast cancer.   
Historically, breast cancer was thought to be a lo cal disease with predictable progression through 
the mammary ducts, lymphatics, and draining lymph nodes before more widespread 
dissemination.  A more recent divergent view of breast cancer is the recognition of the potential 
early micrometastases of cancer cells from the prim ary tumor; in this view, breast cancer is seen 
  
 Page [ADDRESS_488096] 
cancer showed that the treatment produced highly si gnificant benefits in terms of both recurrence 
and survival; reductions in recurrence were 18%, 25%, and 41%, and reductions in death rate 
were 10%, 15%, and 22% for 1, 2, and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment, respectively (7).  These 
benefits are durable as well after disconti nuation of tamoxifen with a 47 % reduction in 
recurrence and 27% improvement in overall survival  after [ADDRESS_488097] not been conclusive, it appears that 5 
years of tamoxifen is the optimal duration in terms of patient benefit (8-12) .  In addition, the 
results of the [ADDRESS_488098]’s Collaborative Group showed that the 
significant improvements in the risk of recurrence and overall survival, with combination 
chemotherapy and tamoxifen in patients with es trogen receptor positive disease were irrespective 
of age or menopausal status (7) . 
Based on the anti-tumor activity of the third-gene ration AIs (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) 
in the metastatic disease setting (13-21) , these medications are currently being assessed in the 
adjuvant setting.  Multiple trials are being conduc ted at this time, and the data from five 
randomized trials is now available.  The first trial, ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in 
Combination) randomized 9,[ADDRESS_488099] cancer who completed primary therapy to one of the th ree arms: tamoxifen alone, anastrozole alone or 
the combination of both.  After the first ev aluation, the arm using the combination was 
discontinued due to lack of superiority over ta moxifen alone.  At the updated efficacy analysis 
after 68 months of follow up , DFS remained signi ficantly longer in the anastrozole arm than in 
the tamoxifen arm with a HR 0.87; P = .01 with an absolute difference of 3.8%, demonstrating a continued benefit after completion of 5 years of therapy.  Time to progression was significantly 
longer for those patients receiving anastrozole co mpared with the patients receiving tamoxifen 
(HR = 0.79; P = .0005), time to distant metastases (HR = .86; P = .04) and a larger benefit was 
seen in the hormone receptor positive populati on.  There was also a 42% decrease in 
contralateral breast cancer (P = .01).  Tolerance was better for anastrozole (22-24) .  Thus, 
anastrozole was the first AI approved by [CONTACT_941] F DA for the adjuvant treatment of early breast 
cancer in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive disease.  A second adjuvant 
trial, IES (Intergroup Exemestane Study) randomi zed 4,742 patients after 2-3 years of adjuvant 
tamoxifen to continued tamoxifen versus exemesta ne for a total of 5 years. After 30.6 months of 
follow up, exemestane demonstrated an impr oved DFS with exemestane (HR 0.68; P < .001), 
and an absolute difference of 4.7%. Long term data  including survival and toxicity data have not 
been presented.  Several other supportive studies with the use of letrozole in the BIG FEMTA 
and BIG 1-[ADDRESS_488100] of the AI.

Additional data has also been published using fi ve years of letrozole following five years of 
adjuvant tamoxifen, the MA-17 trial, in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive 
tumors (randomized study between placebo and letrozole).  At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, the estimated 4-year DFS rate was 93% in the letrozole group compared with 87% in the placebo 
group (25) .       
While both surgery and radiation therapy treatments affect the local disease, adjuvant therapy is 
employed to reduce the risk of systemic disease.  Thus, the current management of breast cancer 
attempts to eradicate breast cancer both at th e primary tumor site and by [CONTACT_389498].  The timing of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389459]-examination.  Observation of effects 
both on the primary tumor and on systemic metastas es has suggested that systemic therapy might 
provide greater efficacy if employed earlier in the treatment of breast cancer (neoadjuvant 
therapy).   
- Neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Preoperative chemotherapy has been employed as part of multimodality therapy for patients with 
locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or infl ammatory breast cancer (IBC).  These patients 
fared poorly with single-modality therapy alone. Hi storical studies demonstrated 5-year disease-
free survival (DFS) rates for LABC to be 41% with surgery alone and 29% with radiation 
therapy (26).  Patients with IBC did worse, with DFS ra tes of 3 to 10% with surgery or radiation 
alone (27).  In contrast, the combination of prim ary chemotherapy, surgical resection, and 
radiotherapy has significantly improved th e clinical outcome of these patients (28, 29) .  As a 
result of the favorable impact that preoperativ e chemotherapy has demonstrated on the survival 
rates of patients with locally advanced diseas e, numerous studies have evaluated its use in 
earlier-stage disease (30-32) . The largest of the randomized studies comparing preoperative to 
postoperative chemotherapy was the NSABP B-[ADDRESS_488101] cancer to receive four cycles of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and 
cyclophosphamide (AC) either preoperatively or  postoperatively.  Although the disease free and 
overall survival rates at 5 years of follow up we re similar between the two cohorts (DFS: 66.7% 
vs. 67.3% and OS: 72.3 vs. 73.2%), it became clear  that preoperative chemotherapy improved 
the breast conservation rate.  There was an overa ll response rate of 79% in the patients after 
preoperative chemotherapy with an increase in the number of conservative surgeries (67% vs. 
60%).  More importantly, the pathologic complete response (CR) rate was directly proportional 
to DFS and overall survival (OS) rates (33, 34) .  For patients who experienced a pCR, DFS and 
overall survival were significantly improved, with  84% of patients with pCR disease free at 5 
years compared to 60% in patients who had no clinical response.   
 
A similar association between pathologic CR rate  and survival has been demonstrated in 
numerous other studies (35-40) .  The pCR is increasingly an  accepted surrogate marker in 
neoadjuvant trials for overall survival and outco mes.  The majority of published studies of 
preoperative chemotherapy have used anthracycline-based regimens with pCR rates between 10-
15%.  However, owing to the efficacy of the si ngle agent taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) in 
the metastatic setting, both taxanes have been incl uded in numerous trials over the past decade.  
Based on the theoretical benefit of combining a lternating cross-resistant chemotherapy agents, 
the addition of paclitaxel and docetaxel to anthracycline-based regimens have increased pCR rates to between 20-25%. This was confirmed in a large randomized neoadjuvant study, NSABP-
  
 Page 9 of 87 Version 031411 
 
27, comparing the addition of docetaxel to an  anthracycline based regimen.  The addition 
increased pCR from 13.7 % to 26.1 % at the cost of increasing G4 toxicity from 10.3 % to 23.4 
%, with an incidence of neutropenic feve r 7.3 % vs. 21.2 %.  Ongoing studies with longer 
follow-up will clarify the role of preoperative ch emotherapy in earlier stage disease and the most 
effective sequence or combination of chemotherape utic agents. As it is described below, it has 
become apparent that not all breast cancer tu mors have the same response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy; as an example, patients with estrogen receptor negative tumors have higher 
pathological complete responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than those with estrogen receptor 
positive tumors.  Hence, pathologic CR rate is c onsidered to be the most important study end 
point to assess the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy regimens. 
 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has multiple practical  and theoretic advantages, enhancing our 
ability to care for patients with breast cancer.  Th is treatment approach remains a standard of 
care for patients with IBC or LABC and a safe option for patients with early-stage breast cancer.  
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can downstage both the primary tumor and metastatic disease in the 
axilla, therefore improving the ability to perfor m breast-conserving therapy without increasing 
the risk for local recurrence.  This approach al so allows the physician to evaluate the in vivo 
response to treatment and potentially to avoid in effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The pathologic CR to a 
particular neoadjuvant therapy regimen can predic t survival, allowing this end point to be used 
as a surrogate that can identify treatments that w ill improve survival much earlier than traditional 
trial designs.  The future of neoadjuvant chem otherapy will be to develop classification or 
predictive markers to tailor therapy to an i ndividual and enhance survival.  Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy is no longer limited to patients with st age III cancer or IBC but is an approach that 
will continue to develop new uses as research continues to move forward. Preoperative 
chemotherapy in primary breast cancer patients is now accepted as an effective treatment, showing that the DFS and overall survival are si milar to those of patients in whom systemic 
therapy is used after surgery.   
- Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for operable breast cancer 
One of the most important factors influenc ing the achievement of pathological CR with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy is hormone receptor status. ER positive patients achieve 
pathological CR rates of 8-12% (or lower) while  ER negative patients have a pathological 
CR rates of 20-40% . Additionally, these chemotherapy regimens are associated with significant 
toxicity including neutropenic fe ver, cardiomyopathy and alopecia (94-96) . Thus, post-
menopausal women with ER positive or PR positiv e (Her-2-neu negative) tumors may benefit 
from alternative, less toxic neo-adjuvant ther apy. Several phase II and III studies conducted with 
tamoxifen have shown that it is possible to obtain good clinical responses with pre-operative 
endocrine therapy. Initial studies in which e ndocrine therapy was compared with surgery 
demonstrated initial reduction in tumor size for the majority of the older patients receiving 
endocrine treatment without impact in the ove rall survival for both groups; however, long-term 
local disease control was poor for those patients receiving endocrine therapy alone (41, 42) .  
This might not be the case when endocrine thera py is used not “in substitution of” but “before” 
optimal local control with surgery.     
 
 
 Page 10 of 87 Version 031411 
 
While tamoxifen is well tolerated, its adverse events are of important clinical consequences to 
the patient.  Thus, the AIs became an alternative treatment in the neoadjuvant setting.  In a phase 
I-II trial conducted in Scotland, a clinical respons e rate of 92% was seen in [ADDRESS_488102] conservative surgery (43) .  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_389460] a ra ndomized, double-blind study designed to compare 
efficacy of preoperative letrozole versus preoperative tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor and/or progesterone recep tor positive breast cancer ineligible for breast 
conservative surgery (44) .  Overall objective response rate was statistically significantly superior 
in the letrozole group (55%) compared with th e tamoxifen group (36%).  In addition, 45% of 
patients in the letrozole group underwent breast c onservative surgery compared with 35% in the 
tamoxifen group.  Clinical complete response was 10% for the group receiving letrozole compared with 4% for the group receiving tamoxife n.  Neoadjuvant letrozole was very tolerable 
as the most common side effect was hot flas hes (20%) and nausea (5%).  Semiglazov et al 
presented to the [ADDRESS_488103] Cancer Conference a 
study randomizing postmenopausal, ER positive patie nts to neoadjuvant AI (anastrozole or 
exemestane) vs. an anthracyline/taxane combination chemotherapy regimen.  This trial demonstrated similar response rates between the tw o cohorts with a similar disease free survival 
at [ADDRESS_488104] conservation 
surgery in the AI group.  Neoadjuvant hormonal th erapy also has similar response rates in both 
Her2 negative (106/154; 64%) and Her2 positive (11/18; 64%) breast cancers.  
The optimal duration of neoadjuvant AI thera py is unknown, with current published trials using 
AI for 3-4 months prior to surgery.  Renshaw et al (San Antonio Breast Cancer Meeting 2004, 
abstract # 405) evaluated [ADDRESS_488105] 
3 months of therapy, 100/142 pt had sufficient tu mor regression to allow BCS with a median 
tumor regression of 52%. The 42 remaining patie nts continued to received letrozole, and 
between 3 and 6 months of therapy, had an additional 57% median tumor regression (CR = 
12/42; 29%).  After 6 months of therapy, 22/42 pa tients continued neoadjuvant letrozole for an 
additional 6 months. Between 6 and 12 months of  therapy there was an additional 66% median 
tumor regression with only 1 patient having progr essive disease (CR = 8/22; 36%).   Extended 
therapy of neoadjuvant AI up to 12 months is sa fe with continued tumor regression. In addition, 
Paepke et al ([ADDRESS_488106]) conducted a trial in which 33 patients 
received letrozole for a minimum of 4 and a ma ximum of 8 months prior to surgery. They 
reported that longer treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in tumor size 
reduction. Moreover, 90% of the patients receiving therapy for longer than 4 months had CR or 
PR compared with 57% of patients with CR or PR receiving therapy for up to [ADDRESS_488107] been proposed including increased levels of intracellular antiestrogen binding sites; alterations in the estrogen receptor; increased agonistic properties of tamoxifen and ligand independent activation of the estrogen 
receptor; activation of ER β by [CONTACT_389499]+ breast cancer cells with estrogen inde pendent and hormone resistant phenotypes (45).  In 
addition, a number of biological fact ors have demonstrated to be related with a favorable or poor 
response to endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389461].   
Angiogenesis represent a fundament al step in tumor progression (46) ; multiple studies have 
shown that node negative as well as node positive breast cancer patients with high  intra-tumoral 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, a pot ent angiogenic factor) concentrations have a 
significantly shorter relapse-free survival (47, 48) .  In addition, the expression of tyrosine 
kinases such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] r eceptor or its family member HER2, the tumor 
suppressor gene TP53, and VEGF have been associated with a poor response to tamoxifen (49, 
50).  Recent studies have demonstrated that oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes associated 
with neoplastic cell transformation play an inte gral part in activating the angiogenic switch.  
Alterations of these genes, including RAS, SRC, HER2, and TP53, have been characterized as inducers of VEGF expression (as an example, mutant TP53 has demonstrated the ability of up-
regulate VEGF) (51).  
Furthermore, studies in UAB Breast Cancer  Spore using the MCF-[ADDRESS_488108]. Fran Kern and collaborat ors indicate that paracrine effects of VEGF 
over-expression by [CONTACT_89482] α+ breast cancer cells can reverse the effectiveness of tamoxifen as a 
cytostatic or cytotoxic agent (52-58) .  In this MCF-7 model, they demonstrated that increased 
expression of VEGF causes an acquired Tam oxifen resistance and tumor loss of estrogen 
dependence in vivo .  MCF-7 cells with VEGF co-expressi on (stably transfected or regulated 
expression) had in vitro  tumor cell proliferation and estrogen dependence identical to non-
transfected MCF-7, while MCF-7/VEGF cells in vivo  displayed increased tumor growth rates, 
higher rates of metastases, and estrogen independen ce.  These survival and proliferation signals 
may be an indirect effect of VEGF presumably  reflecting the enhanced vascularity of tumors 
with secondary growth factor and signal pathway modulation.  Reversal of VEGF over-expression in vivo returned tumors to estrogen dependent growth. 
In addition, Berns and collaborators evaluated the predictive value of TP53 gene mutation status 
and VEGF levels for response to tamoxifen therapy in [ADDRESS_488109] cancer patients with 
ER+ tumors (59).  In a univariate analysis, both TP53 gene mutation and VEGF levels above the 
median value were significantly associated with  a short progression-free survival, post-relapse 
 
 
 Page 12 of 87 Version 031411 
 
overall survival and a poor response to Tamoxifen.  In a Cox multivariate regression analysis 
including the traditional predictive factors, the a ddition of TP53 gene mutation and VEGF status, 
alone or in combination significantly predicte d a poor response to tamoxifen.  When the two 
factors were combined, a significantly decreased odds ratio was seen for response (odds ratio, 0.27).  Similarly, an increased hazard ratio was seen for progression-free survival (2.32) and 
post-relapse overall survival (1.68) in the group with mutant TP53 and high VEGF compared with the group with booth risk factors absent.  
[CONTACT_389556], Ph.D., a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a career development award of the UAB-Breast SPORE, 
conducted preclinical efficacy studies of tamoxi fen and bevacizumab in combination for the 
treatment of breast cancer using a novel mouse model.   In her previous studies she showed that 
elevated levels of VEGF increases tumor gr owth, and promotes metastasis and tamoxifen 
resistance; thus, she hypothesized that a combin ation of agents targeting both ER and VEGF 
signaling may be a more effective treatment than the use of either drug alone.  She tested this 
hypothesis using a combination of tamoxifen and Avastin in a xenograft nude mouse model with regulated-VEGF expression.  The efficacy of the tr eatment was tested in two groups of mice, one 
with early and one with late stage ER-positiv e breast cancer.  All mice received orthotopic 
implantation of 10
7 tumor cells at mammary fat pat and a 17 β-estradiol pellet supplement on Day 
1.  Doxycycline was given to all mice to induce expression and secretion of VEGF from tumor 
cells.  Animals in the early stage group starte d therapy (tamoxifen or Avastin or placebo or 
tamoxifen-Avastin in combination) on Day 7 when the tumor size reached about 100 mm3.  The 
Avastin-tamoxifen combined treatment demonstrated better control of primary tumor growth than therapy with tamoxifen or Avastin alone.  The survival rate was superior in the group of 
mice treated with combination therapy compared with the groups treated with single agents or 
placebo.  Animals in the late stage group starte d therapy on Day 32 when the tumor size reached 
about 1000 mm
3.  The combined treatment showed again a better reduction of tumor growth rate 
and a significant better survival.  83% of mice su rvived in the combined treatment group, while 
only about 50% of mice survived in the monothe rapy groups.  These results demonstrated that 
the Avastin-tamoxifen combination is more effective on inhibiting tumor growth of ER positive breast cancer and increasing survival rate than  either drug treatment alone ([ADDRESS_488110]).    
1.[ADDRESS_488111] provided compelling 
evidence linking tumor growth and metastases with angiogenesis (60).  Human cancer cells 
placed in avascular sites in animals form tumo rs that growth only up to 1-2 mm in diameter (61).  
The same cells implanted in vascular sites grow rapi[INVESTIGATOR_389462], bulky tumors.  Several authors have shown a correlation between microvessel density and clinical outcome.  Weidner and coworkers have shown a statistically significant correlation between the number and density of microvessels in histologic specimens of hum an breast cancer and clinical outcome, including 
the incidence of metastases as well as overall survival and relapse-free survival (62, 63) .  A 
study of a large cohort of patients (836) with operable, invasive breast cancer demonstrated that 
angiogenesis, as measured by [CONTACT_389500] , is an independent prognostic indicator of 
recurrence-free and overall survival (64).  Obermair and co-workers have also demonstrated the 
  
 Page [ADDRESS_488112] cancer (65).  In 
addition, Fox and coworkers have shown an a ssociation between tumor angiogenesis and the 
presence of bone marrow micrometastases in breast cancer patients prior to surgery (66). 
 
Recognition that angiogenesis is essential to the gr owth of solid tumors has led to identification 
of angiogenic factors responsible for stimul ation of new blood vessel formation.  Of the 
identified angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; also known as vascular 
permeability factor) is the most potent and specific and has been identified as a crucial regulator 
of both normal and pathologic angiogenesis (67).  VEGF is a highly conserved, homodimeric, 
secreted, heparin-binding glycoprotein whose dom inant isoform has a molecular weight of 
approximately 45,000 (67, 68) .  VEGF produces a number of biological effects, including 
endothelial cell mitogenesis and migration, induction of proteinases leading to remodeling of the 
extracellular matrix, increased vascular permeab ility, and maintenance of survival for newly 
form blood vessels (67).  VEGF expression is regulated  by [CONTACT_389501] (67).  The biologic effects of VEGF 
are mediated through binding and stimulation of  two receptors on the surface of endothelial 
cells: Flt-1 (fms-like tyrosine kina se) and KDR (kinase domain region) (67).  Increased 
expression of VEGF has been measured in mo st human tumors examined to date, including 
tumors of lung, breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal  tract, kidney, bladder, ovary, and cervix, as well 
as angiosarcomas and glioblastomas (67).  In breast cancer, VEGF mRNA and protein are highly 
expressed in invasive ductal carcinoma, metasta tic ductal carcinoma, and comedo-type DCIS but 
not as highly in lobular carcinoma (69).  Normal breast ductal epi[INVESTIGATOR_389463] e xpression has not been detected. Increased 
VEGF mRNA and protein levels have been show n to correlate with shortened relapsed-free 
survival (70, 71) . 
 
1.3 Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody 
 
Inhibition of VEGF using an anti-VEGF monocl onal antibody blocks the growth of a number of 
human cancer cell lines in nude mice (67).  The human cancers represented by [CONTACT_389502]-inhibited by [CONTACT_14181]-VEGF anti body include non-small cell lung cancer (Calu-6), 
colorectal cancers (LS174T), HM-7, LSLiM6), br east cancer (MCF-7), prostate cancer (D-145), 
head and neck cancer (KB), ovarian cancer (SK-OV-3), and others (67).  In addition, the 
combination of anti-VEGF antibody and chemothe rapy in nude mice injected with human cancer 
xenografts results in an increased anti-tumor effect compared with antibody or chemotherapy 
treatment alone (72). 
 To test the hypothesis that inhibiti on of VEGF in patients with cancer results in clinical benefit, a 
recombinant humanized version of a murine  anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody, named 
rhuMAb VEGF (Bevacizumab or Avastin®), was developed (73).  In cynomolgus monkey 
studies, twice weekly IV treatment with rhuMAb VEGF (doses of 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg) for either 
4, 13, or 26 weeks was well tolerated with no overt signs of acute toxicity (74, 75) .  There were 
no effects on body weight, food consumption, blood pressure, EKGs, rectal body temperature, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], ophthalmologic observations, or clinical pathology parameters.  In all active 
treatment groups, animals with open growth plates  showed physeal dysplasia.  Focal to diffuse 
  
 Page 14 of 87 Version 031411 
 
chondroid necrosis and linear fissuring of the car tilaginous growth plate were also observed.  
Females treated with 10 to 50 mg /kg twice weekly had decreased ovarian and uterine weights, 
which were associated with the absence of corpor a lutea.  Minor changes in some organ weights 
were noted in the 4-week study but were not produced in the 13- or 26- week study.  No 
antibodies against rhuMAb VEGF were detect ed.  To assess the effects on wound healing, 
rabbits were given a partial thickness dermal w ound on the ear or on the back and treated with 
rhuMAbVEGF every other day for two week s at doses from 0.5 to 50 mg/kg per day (76).  Dose-
related inhibition of wound healing was exhibited following treatment with the antibody, with 
maximal inhibition observed at a dose level of 10 mg/kg per day.  No specific tissue cross-
reactivity with human, cynomolgus monkey, or rabbit tissue was observed with 400 μg/ml of the 
antibody.  The results of non-clinical efficacy a nd toxicology studies supported entering clinical 
development.  
- Clinical Trials with Avastin (Bevacizumab)  
 
Avastin has been studied in a multitude of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in more than [ADDRESS_488113]-marketing studies in metastatic  colorectal cancer (CRC).  Approximately 130,[ADDRESS_488114] or in clinical trials.  The following 
discussion summarizes Avastin’s safety profile and presents some of the efficacy results 
pertinent to this particular trial. Please refer to  the Avastin Investigator Brochure for descriptions 
of all completed Phase I, II, and III trials reported to date.  
Phase I studies :  Two phase I trials were c onducted.  The first study was a dose 
escalation, single agent trial in patients with a dvanced malignancies to evaluate safety and 
pharmacokinetics (77).  Five dose levels were evaluated (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) and subjects received 
a total of four doses over a 42-day treatme nt period.  The second study evaluated the 
combination with different chemotherapeutic  agents in patients with advanced solid 
malignancies (78).  The antibody was administered as 8 weekly doses of 3 mg/kg.  In general, 
Avastin was well tolerated in both studies (see Avas tin toxicity profile below).  No antibodies to 
Avastin were detected in either study.  The pharm acokinetics of Avastin appeared to be linear for 
doses greater than 1 mg/kg, with a half-life of  15 days.  The combination with chemotherapy 
agents did not modify the pharmacokinetic behavi or of the antibody.  Thus, these phase I studies 
demonstrated that Avastin was well tolerated and had predictable pharmacokinetics when used either as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents.   
Phase II studies :  Four studies were conducted in NSCLC in combination with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel, hormone-refractory pr ostate cancer as a single agent, relapsed 
metastatic breast cancer as a single agent, and me tastatic colorectal cancer in combination with 
5-FU and Leucovorin (79-81) .  Doses varied from 5 to 20 mg/kg every other week.  Antitumor 
activity has been demonstrated in multiple tumo r types and with both single agent Avastin and 
combination chemotherapy.  In the prostate st udy, no patient had an objective response; however 
there were signs of modest activity.  The NS CLC trial reported increased response rates and 
prolongation of time to disease progression co mpared with chemotherapy alone.  In the 
colorectal trial the hazard of experiencing di sease progression was reduced by 57% in patients 
receiving the combination of Avastin and 5-FU /Leucovorin compared with those receiving 
  
 Page 15 of 87 Version 031411 
 
chemotherapy alone.  Improvements in response rate and median survival were also seen in these 
colorectal patients.  
 
Phase III studies ; pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518] :  Two trials were conducted in metastatic colorectal 
cancer.  The first one was a phase III randomi zed study of irinotecan/5-FU/Leucovorin (IFL) 
with or without Avastin in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (82).  
Patients received up to 48 doses of Avastin on an every 2-week infusion schedule.  Nine hundred 
twenty five patients were enrolled in the trial.   The results for this study confirmed that the 
addition of Avastin to chemotherapy resulted in an increase in overall survival, response rate, 
and duration of response compared with pa tients who received chemotherapy alone.  The 
combination resulted in a statistically signifi cant prolongation of survival (p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) with a 
corresponding increase in median duration of survival from 15.6 months for patients treated with chemotherapy alone to 20.3 months for patients tr eated with the combination of Avastin and 
chemotherapy (hazard ratio of death of 0.660).  The addition of Avastin to chemotherapy also resulted in a significant improvement in progre ssion-free survival; median of 6.24 months for 
patients treated with chemotherapy alone and 10.5 months for patients treated with the combination.  Similar increases were seen in overall response rate (35% vs. 45%), and duration 
of response (7.1 vs. 10.4 months).  The addition of  Avastin to the chemotherapy regimen resulted 
in a small increase in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (from 74% to 85%).  No 
increase was seen in adverse events leading to death or study discontinuation or in 60-day 
mortality.  Grade 3 and 4 adverse events that we re increased in the combination arm compared 
with the chemotherapy arm included deep thrombophlebitis, hypertension, diarrhea, and leucopenia.  No significant differences were obser ved in the incidence of infusion-related events, 
thromboembolic events, grade 3 and 4 bleeding, or  proteinuria of all grades.  The addition of 
Avastin to chemotherapy appeared to increase the risk of the uncommon even t of gastrointestinal 
perforation.   The second trial was a double-blind, randomized tr ial of 5-FU/Leucovorin with or without 
Avastin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not candidates for treatment with 
irinotecan as a first line (83).  The trial enrolled 209 patients.  Patients received up to 48 doses of 
Avastin (5 mg/kg) on an every-2-week infusion schedule.  The addition of Avastin resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of progression-free survival and trends towards improved survival, response rate, and duration of res ponse compared with chemotherapy alone.  The 
addition of the antibody was well tolerated.  Grade [ADDRESS_488115]-line treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed colorectal cancer.  
Additional data from Phase III trials in metastatic CRC (E3200), non− small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC; E4599), and metastatic breast cancer (E2100) have also demonstrated clinical benefit 
from Avastin when added to chemotherapy.  In Study E3200, the addition of Avastin to FOLFOX chemotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with FOLFOX alone 
  
 Page 16 of 87 Version 031411 
 
(13.0 vs. 10.8 months, respectively, HR = 0.75; p < 0.01) in a population of previously treated 
CRC patients. 
 There was also improved overall survival in first-line NSCLC patients (E4599) treated with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel + Avastin compared with chemotherapy alone (12.3 vs. 10.3 months, 
respectively; HR = 0.80; p = 0.003).  The results from this trial were the basis for FDA approval 
of Avastin for use in combination with carboplatin +  paclitaxel as first-line treatment of patients 
with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC in October 
2006.  Finally, patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer (E2100) who received Avastin in combination with weekly paclitaxel had a marked improvement in PFS compared with 
chemotherapy alone (13.3 vs. 6.7 months, respectively; HR = 0.48; p < 0.0001) (see the Avastin 
Investigator Brochure for additional details). 
 
- Avastin in the Treatment of Breast Cancer 
 
The monoclonal antibody has been evaluated in two clinical trials (80, 83) .  The first trial was a 
phase II, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Avastin 
in patients with metastatic breast cancer that relapsed after at least one conventional chemotherapy agent. 18 patients were enrolled at 3 mg/kg every other week, 41 patients were enrolled at 10 mg/kg every other week, and 16 patients were enrolled at 20 mg/kg every other week.  The overall response rate was 9.3% (7 out of 75 patients).  A PR in a cervical lymph node was observed in 1 out of 18 patients treated at the 3 mg/kg dose cohort.  One CR and 4 PRs were observed among the 41 patients enrolled in the 10 mg/kg dose cohort.  One PR was observed in the group of patients treated in the 20 mg/kg dose cohort.  Toxicity observed in this trial was not different from the toxicity in all other trials.  Pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that the profile was similar to that in the colorectal and NSCLC phase II trials.  Thus, this trial showed evidence of single-agent activity of Avastin in metastatic breast cancer and provided the rationale for a phase III trial using Avastin in combination with chemotherapy in this setting.  The first Phase III trial in breast cancer was a randomized, open-label study that evaluated safety and efficacy of Avastin in combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic disease previously treated.  Patients received up to 35 doses of Avastin on an every-3-week infusion schedule (15 mg/kg per dose).  The trial enrolled 462 patients.  The results of the primary efficacy analysis showed that the treatment with the combination of Avastin and capecitabine did not result in a statistically significant prolongation in progression-free survival compared with capecitabine alone.  There was a statistically significant increase in the secondary endpoint of objective response rate; however, this did not result in an improvement in progression-free survival.  The adverse event profile was similar to that for the completed phase III trials.  More recently Dr. K Miller presented the results of an ECOG phase III trial (E2100) in which patients with untreated metastatic  breast cancer were randomized to paclitaxel versus paclitaxel and Avastin were presented (Proc ASCO [ADDRESS_488116] Cancer 94(1): Abstract #3, 2005). A 
total of [ADDRESS_488117] cancer who had not previously received systemic chemotherapy for their recurrent or metastatic disease were enrolled in this study between December 2001 and May 2004. Patients whose tumors overexpressed HER-2 were not included in the study unless they had previously received trastuzumab (Herceptin
TM) or were 
  
 Page 17 of 87 Version 031411 
 
unable to receive trastuzumab. Also excluded were patients who had received adjuvant 
chemotherapy treatment with paclitaxel within the previous 12 months, as well as patients with a prior history of blood clots or who were anticoagulated.   In this trial the combination showed statistically significant prolongation of disease free survival (10.9 months vs. 6.1 months) and 
response rate (28.2% versus 14.2%).  The tolerance of the combination was excellent.  Avastin combination was well tolerated and now is being evaluated in the adjuvant setting.  Thus, efficacy of Avastin has been demonstrated in breast cancer.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_389464] (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in the neoadjuvant setting for post-menopausal, ER positive patients with locally advanced breast cancer was initiated in our institution at the end of 2005.  Although it is early to evaluate efficacy at this time (August 2006), the combination has showed to be safe in the 18 patients enrolled (same toxicity profile of Letrozole and Avastin).  Of the [ADDRESS_488118] 12 weeks of therapy and was taken off the study at that time.  Of the other 10 patients, 2 came out of the study due to refractory hypertension and 8 are in active therapy now.  Of the 8 patients that had surgery, none has had a problem with healing.  The Avastin dose selected for this trial was based on the pharmacokinetic data provided by [CONTACT_8229] (similar to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) as well as the experience in previous clinical trials.  It is anticipated that preliminary results will be presented at the 2007 ASCO annual meeting.    The safety of the combination between Letrozole and Avastin has also been demonstrated by [CONTACT_389503] ([ADDRESS_488119]). Metastatic breast 
cancer patients were eligible for the trial. Therapy consisted of letrozole (2.5 mg daily) and Avastin (15 mg/kg IV q3 weeks). The primary endpoint was frequency of Grade (Gr) 4 toxicity. Thirty two patients were enrolled and at the time of publication 28 were evaluable. After a median of 8 cycles, therapy-related toxicities observed were: Gr 2: hypertension 4, headache 4, proteinuria 3, fatigue 6, joint pain 5, hot flashes 1, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] 1; Gr 3: hypertension 5, headache 1, proteinuria 1. There was no therapy-related Gr 4/5 toxicity. They concluded that the combination was safe and well tolerated.     
- Avastin Safety Profile 
 
In the initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential Avastin-associated safety signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage.  Additional completed Phase II and Phase III studies of Avastin as well as spontaneous reports have further defined the safety profile of this agent. Avastin -associated adverse events identified in phase III 
trials include congestive heart failure (CHF), gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing complications, and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE). These and other safety signals are described in further detail as follows and in the Avastin Investigator Brochure. 
 
Hypertension : Hypertension has been commonly seen in Avastin clinical trials to date 
and oral medications have been used to manage the hypertension when indicated. Grade [ADDRESS_488120] included hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
  
 Page 18 of 87 Version 031411 
 
syndrome (RPLS) (Ozcan et al., 2006; Glusker et al., 2006). RPLS may include signs and 
symptoms of headache, altered mental function, seizures, and visual disturbances / cortical 
blindness and requires treatment, which should include control of hypertension, management of specific symptoms, and discontinuation of Avastin. 
 
 There is no information on the effect of Avastin in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of initiating Avastin therapy.  Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating Avastin therapy in these patients.  Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during Avastin therapy.  Optimal control of blood pressure according to standard public health guidelines is recommended for patients on treatment with or without Avastin.   Temporary interruption of Avastin therapy is recommended in patients with hypertension requiring medical therapy until adequate control is achieved.  If hypertension cannot be controlled with medical therapy, Avastin therapy should be permanently discontinued.  Avastin should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 
 
 Proteinuria : An increased incidence of proteinuria has been observed in patients treated 
with Avastin compared with control arm patients.  In the Avastin-containing treatment arms of clinical trials (across all indications), the incidence of proteinuria (reported as an adverse event) was up to 38% (metastatic CRC Study AVF2192g).  The severity of proteinuria has ranged from 
asymptomatic and transient events detected on routine dipstick urinalysis to nephrotic syndrome; the majority of proteinuria events have been grade 1. NCI-CTC Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up to 3% of Avastin-treated patients, and Grade 4 in up to 1.4% of Avastin-treated patients.  The proteinuria seen in Avastin clinical trials was not associated with renal impairment and rarely required permanent discontinuation of Avastin therapy.  Avastin should be discontinued in patients who develop Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome). 
 
 Patients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of proteinuria when treated with Avastin.  There is evidence from the dose-finding, Phase II trials (AVF0780g, AVF0809s, and AVF0757g) suggesting that Gr ade 1 proteinuria may be related to 
Avastin dose.   Proteinuria will be monitored by [CONTACT_39701]:creatinine (UPC) ratio at least every 6 weeks.  If the UPC ratio is not available, a dipstick urinalysis may be used to allow treatment to proceed.  
Thromboembolic Events : Both venous and arterial thromboembolic (TE) events, 
ranging in severity from catheter-associated phlebitis to fatal, have been reported in patients treated with Avastin in the colorectal cancer trials and, to a lesser extent, in patients treated with Avastin in NSCLC and breast cancer trials.  
 
 Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, and thrombophlebitis:  In the phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], there was a 
slightly higher rate of venous TE events that was not statistically significant in patients treated 
with Avastin plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (19% vs. 16%).  
 
 
 Page 19 of 87 Version 031411 
 
 
 In Study AVF2107g, a Phase III, pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], VTE events, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis, occurred in 15.2% of 
patients receiving chemotherapy alone and 16.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy +  Avastin. 
  The incidence of NCI-CTC Grade ≥ 3 venous VTE events in one NSCLC trial (E4599) 
was higher in the Avastin-containing arm compared to the chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs. 
3.2%).  One event (0.2%) was fatal in the Avastin-containing arm; not fatal events were reported in the carboplatin/paclitaxel arm (see Avastin Investigator Brochure).  In metastatic CRC clinical 
trials, the incidence of VTE events was similar in patients receiving chemotherapy + Avastin and 
those receiving the control chemotherapy alone.  
  In clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of VTE events was 
2.8%−17.3% in the Avastin-containing arms compared with 3.2% −15.6% in the chemotherapy 
control arms.  The use of Avastin with chemotherapy does not substantially increase the risk of 
VTE event compared with chemotherapy alone.  However, patients with metastatic CRC who receive Avastin and experienced a VTE event may be at higher risk for recurrence of VTE event. 
 
 Arterial Thromboembotic Events:  An increased incidence of ATE events was 
observed in patients treated with Avastin compared with those receiving control treatment.  ATE 
events include cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and other ATE events.  In a pooled analysis of data from five randomized Phase II and III trials (mCRC [AVF2107g, AVF2192g, AVF0780g]; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC [AVF0757g]; metastatic breast cancer [AVF2119g]), th e incidence rate of ATE events was 3.8% 
(37 of 963) in patients who received chemotherapy
 + Avastin compared with 1.7% (13 of 782) in 
patients treated with chemotherapy alone.  ATE events led to a fatal outcome in 0.8% (8 of 963) 
of patients treated with chemotherapy  + Avastin and 0.5% (4 of 782) of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  Cerebrovascular accidents (including TIAs) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with chemotherapy
 + Avastin and 0.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone.  
Myocardial infarction occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with chemotherapy  + Avastin 
compared with 0.7% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone (see the Avastin Investigator 
Brochure for additional details).  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolic events in patients at high risk of such events, and the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤ [ADDRESS_488121] to metastatic colorectal cancer patients were presented at ASCO 2005 (Hambleton et al., 2005). Further analyses of the effects of concomitant use of Avastin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_47274].  
  
 Page 20 of 87 Version 031411 
 
Gastrointestinal perforation : Patients with metastatic carcinoma may be at increased 
risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation when treated with Avastin and 
chemotherapy. Avastin should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. A causal association of intra-abdominal inflammatory process and gastrointestinal perforation to Avastin has not been established. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when treating patients with intra-abdominal inflammatory processes with Avastin. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in other trials in non-colorectal cancer populations (e.g., ovarian, renal cell, pancreas, breast, and NSCLC) and may be higher in incidence in some tumor types.  
 Fistula :  Avastin use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including events 
resulting in death.  Fistulae in the GI tract are common (1%–10% incidence) in patients with 
metastatic CRC, but uncommon (0.1% −1%) or rare (0.01%–0.1%) in other indications.  In 
addition, fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the GI tract (e.g., tracheoesophageal, 
bronchopleural, urogenital, biliary) have been reported uncommonly (0.1%–1%) in patients 
receiving Avastin in clinical studies and postmarketing reports.  Events were reported at various 
timepoints during treatment, ranging from 1 week to > [ADDRESS_488122], discontinuation of 
Avastin should be considered.  
Wound healing complications:  Wound healing complications such as wound 
dehiscence have been reported in patients receiving Avastin. In an analysis of pooled data from two trials in metastatic colorectal cancer, patients undergoing surgery 28-60 days before study treatment with 5-FU/LV plus Avastin did not app ear to have an increased risk of wound healing 
complications compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone (Scappaticci et al., 2005). Surgery in patients currently receiving Avastin is not recommended. No definitive data are available to define a safe interval after Avastin exposure with respect to wound healing risk in patients receiving elective surgery; however, the estimated half life of Avastin is 20 days. 
Avastin should be discontinued in patients with severe wound healing complications. 
 
 If patients receiving treatment with Avas tin require elective major surgery, it is 
recommended that Avastin be held for 4–8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.  Patients 
undergoing a major surgical procedure should not begin or restart Avastin until 4 weeks after 
that procedure (in the case of high-risk proce dures such as liver resection, thoracotomy, or 
neurosurgery, it is recommended that chemothe rapy be restarted no earlier than 6 weeks and 
Avastin no earlier than 8 weeks after surgery). 
 
Hemorrhage: Overall, grade 3 and 4 bleeding ev ents were observed in 4.0% of 1132 
patients treated with Avastin in a pooled database from eight phase I, II, and III clinical trials in 
multiple tumor types (Avastin Investigator Br ochure, October 2005). The hemorrhagic events 
that have been observed in Avastin clinical studies were predominantly tumor-associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage. 
  
 Page 21 of 87 Version 031411 
 
 
Tumor-Associated Hemorrhage:  Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage or 
hemoptysis has been observed primarily in patie nts with NSCLC.  Life-threatening and fatal 
hemoptysis was identified as a Avastin-relate d adverse event in NSCLC trials.  Tumor-
associated hemorrhage was observed in phase I a nd phase II Avastin studies. Six serious events, 
of which 4 had fatal outcome, were observed in a phase II trial of patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer receiving Avastin. These events o ccurred suddenly and presented as major or 
massive hemoptysis in patients with either squamous cell histology and/or tumors located in the center of the chest in close pr oximity to major blood vessels. In five of these cases, these 
hemorrhages were preceded by [CONTACT_389504]/or necrosis of the tumor. Tumor-associated 
hemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumo r types and locations, including central nervous 
system (CNS) bleeding in a patient with hepato ma with occult CNS metastases and continuous 
oozing of blood from a thigh sarcoma with necrosis. 
 
 GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding a nd Melena have been reported in patients 
with CRC, and have been assessed as tumor-associated hemorrhages. 
 
Mucocutaneous Hemorrhage:  Across all Avastin clinical trials, mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage has been seen in 20%-40% of patie nts treated with Avastin. These were most 
commonly NCI-CTC grade [ADDRESS_488123] also been 
less common events of minor mucocutaneous hemo rrhage in other locations, such as gingival 
bleeding and vaginal bleeding.   
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome:   There have been rare reports 
of Avastin-treated patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_389465], a rare 
neurologic disorder that can present with the following signs and symptoms (among others):  
seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual  disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or 
without associated hypertension.  Brain imaging is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS.  
In patients who develop RPLS, treatment of  specific symptoms, including control of 
hypertension, is recommended along with discontinuation of Avastin.  The safety of reinitiating Avastin therapy in patients previously experi encing RPLS is not known (Glusker et al. 2006; 
Ozcan et al. 2006). 
 
Congestive heart failure : CHF has been reported in Avastin  clinical trials and may be 
increased in incidence in patients with prior exposur e to anthracyclines or prior irradiation to the 
chest wall.  In a phase III trial (AVF2119g) of  capecitabine with or without Avastin for 
metastatic breast cancer, 7 subjects (3.1%) who received capecitabine plus Avastin developed 
clinically significant CHF compared with 2 subj ects (0.9%) treated with capecitabine alone; of 
note, all subjects in this trial had had prior anthracycline treatment.  In addition, 2 subjects had a 
left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% at ba seline and [ADDRESS_488124] wall 
irradiation.  A recently published phase II study in subjects with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia reported 5 cases of cardiac dysfunction (CHF or decreases to <40% in left ventricular ejection fraction) of 48 subjects treated with sequential cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and Avastin.  
All but one of these subjects had significant prior exposure to anthracyclines as well (Karp et al., 
2004).  Other studies are ongoing in this patient population.  Patients receiving anthracyclines or 
  
 Page [ADDRESS_488125] 
cancer (E2100), the incidence of LVEF decrease (d efined as NCI-CTC Grade 3 or 4) in the 
paclitaxel + Avastin arm was 0.3% for the paclitaxel alone arm. 
 No information is available on patients with preexisting CHF of [LOCATION_001] Heat 
Association (NYHA) Class II-IV at the time of in itiating Avastin therapy, as these patients were 
excluded from clinical trials. 
 
 Two additional studies investigated concu rrent administration of anthracyclines and 
Avastin.  In [ADDRESS_488126] cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, 
doxorubicin, and Avastin, no patients developed clin ically apparent CHF; however, patients had 
asymptomatic decreases in LVEF to < 40% (Wedam et al. 2004).  In a small Phase II study in 
patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 2 of the 17 patients treated with Avastin and high-dose 
doxorubicin (75 mg/m
2) developed CHF (one Grade 3 event after a cumulative doxorubicin dose 
of 591 mg/m2, one Grade 4 event after a cu mulative doxorubicin dose of 420 mg/m2); an 
additional 4 patients had asymptomatic decreases in LVEF (D’Adamo et al. 2004). 
 
 Other studies in patients with various tumor types and either a history of anthracycline exposure or concomitant use with Avastin are ongoing.   Patients receiving concomitant anthracyclines or with prior exposure to anthracyclines should have a baseline MUGA scans or echocardiograms (ECHOs) with a normal LVEF.  
 Neutropenia:   Increased rates of severe neutropeni a, febrile neutropenia, or infection 
with severe neutropenia (including some fatalities)  have been observed in patients treated with 
some myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens plus Avastin in comparison to chemotherapy alone 
(Sandler et al. 2006). 
 Additional Adverse Events: See the Avastin I nvestigator Brochure for additional details 
regarding the safety experience with Avastin.  
1.4 Hypothesis for This Study 
 
Preclinical and clinical data (described in the background of this protocol) have demonstrated that up-regulation of tumor cell VEGF is an  important mechanism to subvert estrogen 
dependence in hormone responsive breast cancer re sulting in reduced therapy response or tumor 
resistance to hormonal therapy; thus, we hypothe size that the combination of an anti-VEGF 
agent (Avastin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal an tibody) and hormonal therapy should be more 
effective than hormonal therapy alone for the treatment of breast cancer.  
1.[ADDRESS_488127] be

under development (e.g., signal transduction inhib itors, agents to down-regulate VEGF, etc).  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_389466] a challenge because we still do not have a clear understanding of the molecular basis of resistance.   The development of anti-VEGF therapy to overc ome resistance to endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389467].  The unique mechanism of action, limited toxicity and preclinical and clinical data generated with Avastin, and th e pre-clinical and clinical observations by [CONTACT_389505], 
Berns and Qu demonstrating correlation between VEGF expression and response to hormonal therapy, support the hypothesis that VEGF expression by [CONTACT_389506] a potential mechanism for estrogen independence of breast tumors.  Interference with VEGF activity would thus 
improve and/or restore response anti-estrogen drug therapy.  We therefore hypothesize that the 
efficacy of hormonal therapy in women wi th ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer can be 
augmented by [CONTACT_389507], a recombinant humanized antibody to vascular 
endothelial cell growth factor.  As described below, neoadjuvant therapy is a very attractive model to evaluate the hypothesis.

amplified by [CONTACT_4656]). Patients with inflammatory  breast cancer will not be included (T4d).  The 
primary objective for this randomized phase II tr ial is to estimate the pathological complete 
response rates, defined as the percentage of patie nts with a complete pathological response at the 
time of surgery, for each of the two arms in the trial (see Section 11 – Statistical Section).    
 Patients must be post-menopausal (no peri- or pre-menopausal) and [ADDRESS_488130]

indication, dedicated breast MRI may be used – not required per protocol), and have a 
performance status of ECOG 0 or 1. Patients prev iously treated or patients with no measurable 
disease or patients with metastatic disease will be excluded.  Patients will be registered through the Clini cal Trials Network (CTN) Office of the UAB 
Comprehensive Cancer Center where the CTN Manage r will register the patie nt in the trial  (will 
randomize and complete the randomization forms) .  Monthly accrual will be communicated to 
the Breast Cancer Research Consortium and Genent ech.  Within eight weeks before the initiation 
of the therapy patients will have a PET/CT scan or [CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis,  with a 
bone scan].    Patients with metastatic disease will not be enrolled in th e trial.  Additionally, 
blood counts, UA, urinary protein/creatinine ratio  (24-hour urine collection if indicated), INR 
and CMP will be obtained within [ADDRESS_488131] diagnosis (H&E, ER /PR receptors, Her-2-neu status) as well as to 
provide tissue for the biomarker assays (tumor bloc ks and fresh tissue).  If the patient agrees to 
consent, a core needle biopsy of the upper quadr ant of the unaffected breast will be obtained for 
comparison of biomarkers.  Patients with palpable axillary lymph nodes or  patients with FNA positive axillary lymph nodes 
will be treated as having at least N1 disease a nd are not required to undergo sentinel lymph node 
biopsy prior to initiation of neoadjuvant ther apy; axillary lymph node dissection will be 
performed in those patients at the time of definitiv e surgery.  Sentinel lymph node biopsy is to be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physicia n according to institution  protocol. A sentinel 
node procedure will not be required on non-palpable  nodes before initiation of protocol therapy. 
However, if a sentinel node procedure is perfor med for non-palpable modes, then Letrozole can 
be started immediately post sentinel node proce dure with Avastin being able to begin [ADDRESS_488132]-surgical adjuvant therapy will be administered at the 
investigator’s discretion (chemotherapy is allowed).  Patients meeting the eligibility criteria and who have signed the consent form will start Letrozole 2.5 mg PO a day and Avastin 15 mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_488133] evaluation (physical evaluation and

every 6 weeks for a total of 24 weeks or until progression is observed.  If during the second 
evaluation (12 weeks) an objective response or stable response is observed, the patient will 
complete therapy, but if during the 12 week ev aluation the patient has disease progression the 
patient will be removed from the protocol and will be  treated at the investigator’s discretion.  If a 
patient has a clinical response with tumor size d ecreasing to less than [ADDRESS_488134] Avastin dose (fourth evaluation on week  24).  Patients will continue letrozole during 
those 4 weeks before the surgery.  No dose reductions are planned. 
 In the absence of treatment delays due to advers e events, treatment may continue until one of the 
following criteria applies: 24 weeks of therapy, disease progression, intercurrent illness that 
prevents further administration of treatment, any t oxicity that results in a treatment delay of > 3 
weeks, unacceptable grade 3 or 4 non-hematologi c adverse events(s), patient decides to 
withdraw from the study for any reason, or general or specific changes in the patient's condition

3.[ADDRESS_488135] disease free survival, dramatically shortening the typi[INVESTIGATOR_389468] 
a clinical trial of a novel agent/regimen from years to 4-6 months.  In this trial, we will use a novel combination of hormonal agent (letrozole) and an anti-VEGF 
monoclonal antibody (Avastin) in the neoadjuvant  setting based on pre-clinical and clinical 
observations previously described in the backgr ound and the data will be compared with that 
obtained from patients treated with letrozole al one.  In choosing this combination we hope the 
combination will be synergistic and will dem onstrate higher efficacy than the use of the 
hormonal agent alone.  We will investigate m odulation of breast cancer biomarkers during 
neoadjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed breas t cancer (see appendix I and section 6.2 for a 
detailed description). Tissue will be obtained before initiation of therapy, and [ADDRESS_488136] in the paraffin embedded tissue include: marker of 
proliferation (Ki-67), apoptotic markers (T unnel, caspase 3, bcl-2 and bax), and a novel 
prognostic factor (Zinc finger protein GKLF/KL F-4, a novel oncogene recently described by 
[CONTACT_389510]).  In addition, we will plan on coding, processing, and banking fresh frozen tissue; this stored tissue will be transferred to [CONTACT_389557] (University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill).  Tissue stored in this fashion w ill be used for examination of differential gene 
expression patterns. In addition, circulating tu mor cells will be evaluated before and after 
therapy (These assays will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Hope Rugo, University of [LOCATION_004] at San 
Francisco).   
  
 Page [ADDRESS_488137] decided to allow the 
patients enrolled in this trial to receive therapy for up to 6 months based on: 1. the published data 
(described in the background) which suggested that extended therapy with an AI in the neoadjuvant setting for up to [ADDRESS_488138] a further reduction in 
tumor volume with continued therapy; 2. The fact  that tumor response to biological agents is 
slow; and 3. The safety rule included in this tr ial in which patients who have not had a response 
at the 12 week evaluation will be taken off th e study. In addition, the Avastin dose of 15 mg/kg 
every three weeks was selected based on: 1. previous clinical studies in which the dose demonstrated to be safe and effective, 2. Pharmacokinetic data which demonstrated that this dose is pharmacologically equivalent to the 10 mg/kg every two weeks.   
We believe this approach will allow a relat ively rapid assessment of a novel regimen 
(translational research) and aid in identi fying surrogate endpoint markers which will 
enhance our ability to select patients who a re likely to benefit from these interventions.

3.3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
 
The clinical response will be based on the Re sponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST Criteria) described in Appendix H.   
 
4.0 SAFETY PLAN 
Based on the toxicity profile of Avastin (see sec tion 1.3), a number of measures will be taken to 
ensure the safety of the patients enrolled in this  trial.  These measures will be addressed through 
exclusion criteria (see section 5.3) and routine monitoring as follows:  
 Patients enrolled in the trial will be carefully monitored during the entire treatment period and will be followed as is appropriate.  Safety ev aluations will consist of medical interviews, 
collection of adverse events, PE, VS, and laborat ory measurements (see Section 8).  Patients will 
be evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation at each st udy visit for the duration of the participation 
in the study.  Patients discontinued from treatment for any reason will be evaluated approximately 30 days (28-42 days) after the la st dose of Avastin (see section 8.3).  Specific 
monitoring procedures are as follow:   
  
 Page 27 of 87 Version 031411 
 
• Hypertension will be monitored through routine evaluation of blood pressure prior to each 
Avastin treatment.  Optimal control of blood pr essure according to standard public health 
guidelines is recommended for patients on treatment with or without Avastin.   
• In patients with bleeding, hemostasis evaluation should be performed as clinically indicated.   
• Proteinuria will be monitored through regular urinalysis and urinary protein/creatinine ratio 
or dipstick at least every 6 weeks (before the administration of Avastin).  
• Patients who have an ongoing Avastin-related Grade 4 or serious adverse event at the time of discontinuation from study treatment will continue to be followed (see Section 7). 
• If patients on treatment with Avastin require major surgery or choose elective major surgery, 
it is recommended that Avastin be held for 4-8 w eeks prior to the surgical procedure. Patients 
undergoing a major surgical procedure should not  begin/restart Avastin until 4 weeks after 
that procedure (in the case of high risk proce dures such as liver resection, thoracotomy, or 
neurosurgery, it is recommended that chemotherapy be restarted no earlier than 6 weeks and that Avastin be restarted no earlier than 8 wk after surgery). 
 Please see Section 7 for detailed instructions for the management of study drug–related toxicities.

6.2 Biopsy Specimens and Research Blood Samples  
(See Appendix I for detailed description of sample timing, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) 
 
Core biopsies will be obtained before initiation of therapy and 6 weeks afte r initiation of therapy.  
Biopsy samples will preferably be obtained using a 14-18 gauge core needle; at least two core 
biopsies will be obtained for frozen research biops ies and two for the preparation of the paraffin 
blocks.  If blocks from original diagnosis (before enrolling in the trial) are available, they will be 
obtained and then only samples for the frozen re search biopsies will be obtained.  Processing of 
the specimens is described in Appendix I.  Para ffin blocks will be sent to UAB while frozen 
research biopsies will be sent to [CONTACT_389558] s Perou (Departments of Genetics and Pathology, 
Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC).  Tissue sections obtained as described in Appe ndix I from paraffin-embedded material will be 
sectioned and stained for a marker of prolifera tion (Ki67), apoptosis markers (TUNEL, caspase 3 
bcl-2, bax), and a novel prognostic factor (zin c finger protein GKLF/KLF4, a novel oncogene 
recently described by [CONTACT_389510]) by c onventional IHC. Frozen research biopsies will 
be used for gene expression array analysis and will be performed as previously described (97). 
Briefly, total RNA will be isolated from the research biopsies. [CONTACT_389559] has successfully 
analyzed specimens using tissue from ½ of a core biopsy (approximately 5 mg tissue). The 
isolated RNA from the breast tumors will be reverse transcribed to cDNA using the 
incorporation of a fluorescently tagged “red” dye (Cy5). A "common reference" sample cDNA 
will be prepared from RNA pooled from 11 di verse human cell lines, and fluorescently tagged 
with a “green” dye (Cy3). The red-tagged cDNA from the breast tumor will be hybridized on a 
microarray with the green-tagged "common refere nce". The ratio of fluorescence intensity at 
each gene on the array will be measured for the data analysis. The DNA microarray will be 
obtained from UNC/LCCC Genomics Core Facility. The analysis of gene expression profiles 
based on the DNA microarray data will be done us ing statistical analysis and hierarchical

previously established criteria (97) and comparis on of changes in profile induced by [CONTACT_389512].  
 
Gene expression Profiling Analyses.   In this study, patients will be randomized to receive 
letrozole, or letrozole plus Avastin.  To exam ine the possibility that gene expression patterns 
might be able to identify those patients who w ould gain a benefit from Avastin, we propose to 
perform DNA microarray analyses on the pretreatment biopsies and perform supervised analyses 
to identify gene patterns that might correlate with response to Avastin.  We will perform an 
exploratory study of the available microarray data in  order to identify a set(s) of genes that are 
predictive of response or resistance to Avastin.  The clinical endpoint used will be pCR vs. no 
pCR, and clinical response classified as SD+P D vs. CR+PR measured after the first phase of 
treatment, and after all neoadjuvant treatments are complete.  To predict response, the expression data for the pre-treatment samples will be us ed and the “supervising parameter” will be 
pathologic complete response (pCR).  Four statistical classification methods are used to develop predictors of response when using the pre-treat ment gene expression data: a k-Nearest Neighbor 
Classifier (k-NN with k=1, 3, 5, or 7) with either Euclidean distance or one-minus-Spearman-
correlation as the distance function, and a Class N earest Centroid (CNC) classifier with either 
Euclidean distance or one-minus-Spearman-correlation as the distance function.   To evaluate the gene expression predictor accuracy, each of the four prediction methods 
undergoes 10-fold cross validation (CV) where in a given round of CV, each predictor uses n 
genes (with the n genes selected using the ratio of between-group to within-group sums of 
squares {105}) obtained from training on 90% of the samples, which are then used to make predictions on the remaining 10%.  This procedure is repeated 9 more times such that every sample is “left out” exactly once.  The predicti on accuracies on the withheld samples for each of 
the 10 iterations are averaged and this average prediction accuracy recorded for each prediction 
method with each n gene set. n is increased and decreased for many subsequent rounds of CV.  
For each supervising parameter/response variable, the set of n genes that gives the highest 
average prediction accuracy during CV is determ ined and reported for each prediction method.  
Using this approach, we have created centroid pr edictors that could classify tumors (1) into 
intrinsic subtypes that predict outcomes and s how high concordance with the GHI RS and NKI 
70-gene profiles, (2) according to novel pattern s of estrogen-regulated genes that predict 
outcomes in tamoxifen-treated patients, and (3 ) according to lymph node metastasis status.  
Thus, we will be able to determine if gene e xpression patterns are associated with response to 
Avastin.  Lastly, we will also compare pretreat ment samples versus during treatment, and post 
treatment samples if they exist, in order to identify a set of genes, or sets of genes, that change in 
response to the administration of letrozole, and the addition of letrozole and Avastin.  Circulating tumor cells (CTC) from whole bl ood will be processed for immunohistochemistry 
and RNA-based studies  and compared to results obtained using the automated Veridex method 
for enumeration of circulating tumor cells.   Patients will be allowed to start Avastin therapy next day after core biopsies.

7.0 STUDY MEDICATION  
 7.1  Avastin Dosage and Formulation  
 
Avastin will be supplied by [CONTACT_131688] a clear to  slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown, 
sterile liquid concentrate for parenteral admini stration.  Avastin will be supplied in 5 cc (100 
mg), 20 cc (400 mg), and 50 cc (1000 mg) glass vials with a 4 ml, 16 ml, or 40 ml of Avastin, respectively (all at 25 mg/ml).  The formula tion contains sodium phosphate, trehalose, 
polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection, USP.  Vials contain no preservative and are 
suitable for single use only.  The monoclonal an tibody (Avastin) being administered is the 
commercially marketed drug (Avastin). For further details and molecule characterization, see the Avastin Investigator Brochure.  The dose of Avastin administered in this study is 15 mg/kg given by [CONTACT_389513] 3 weeks for up to 24 weeks.  The patient’s weight at screening will be used to determine the dose of Avastin to be used for the durati on of the study; however, if a patient’s weight 
changes by 10% during the study, the dose of Avas tin will be recalculated.  Treatment will be 
administered on an outpatient  basis. 
 
7.1.1 Avastin Administration 
 
Avastin will be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP, to a total volume of 100 ml.  Avastin will be administered as a continuous IV  infusion.  Anaphylaxis precautions should be 
observed during the study drug administration.  The initial Avastin dose should be delivered over 90±[ADDRESS_488152] infusion is tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events, the 
second infusion may be delivered over 60±10 mi nutes.  If the 60-minute infusion is well 
tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be de livered over 30± 10 minutes.  A rate-regulating 
device should be used for all Avastin infusions.  When the Avastin IV bag is empty, an additional 50 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride inj ection should be added to the IV bag and the 
infusion should be continued for a volume equal to that of the tubing to ensure complete delivery 
of the Avastin.  An alternative method of flushing the infusion line would be to replace the empty Avastin infusion bag with a 50 ml bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection and infuse a volume equal to that of the tubing to ensure co mplete delivery of the Avastin.  This additional 
saline flush is not included in the specified infusion times.  If a patient experiences Avastin infusion-associat ed adverse events, the patient may receive pre-
medication at the investigator’s discretion prior to the next Avastin infusion.  If pre-medication 
is required, the infusion time may not be decreased for the subsequent infusion.  However, if the 
next infusion is well tolerated with pre-medica tion, the subsequent infusion time may then be 
decreased by 30 minutes per infusion to a mini mum infusion time of 30±10 minutes as long as 
the patient continues to receive the same pre-me dication.  If a pre-medicated patient experiences 
infusion-associated adverse events with the 60- minute infusion, all subsequent doses should be 
given over 90±15 minutes.  Similarly, if a pre-medi cated patient experiences infusion associated 
adverse events with the 30-minute infusion, a ll subsequent doses should be given over 60±10 
minutes.  
  
 Page 33 of 87 Version 031411 
 
Anaphylaxis Precautions:  
Anaphylaxis precautions should be observed duri ng Avastin administration.  The patient’s blood 
pressure and heart rate should be monitored every 15 minutes during the infusion.  Emergency 
agents including oxygen, oral and endotracheal airways, intubation equipment, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
antihistamines and corticosteroids should be availa ble.  In the event of a suspected anaphylactic 
reaction during infusion of Avastin, the infusion should be interrupted for subjects who develop 
dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension. Subjects who experience a NCI CTCAE v. 3.0 
Grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction / hypersensitiv ity, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or 
bronchospasm (regardless of grade) will be discontinued from Avastin treatment.  The infusion should be slowed to 50% or less or interrupted for subjects who experience any infusion-associated symptoms not specified above. When the subject’s symptoms have 
completely resolved, the infusion may be continued at no more than 50% of the rate prior to the 
reaction and increased in 50% increments every 30 minutes if well tolerated. Infusions may be 
restarted at the full rate during the next cycle. Administer antihistamines, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or other 
medications at the investigator’s discretion.  Avastin Infiltration: 
 
Should infiltration of the Avastin infusion occur the following steps are to be taken:  Discontinue 
the IV.  If a significant volume of the Avastin in fusion remains, restart the IV and complete the 
infusion.  Treat the infiltration according to in stitutional guidelines for infiltration of a non-
caustic agent.  
7.1.2 Avastin Storage 
 
Upon receipt of Avastin, vials are to be refriger ated at 2°C-8°C (36°F-46°F) and should remain 
refrigerated until just prior to use.  DO NOT  FREEZE. DO NOT SHAKE.  Opened vials must be 
prepared for use within [ADDRESS_488153] medical 
practice. Avastin has a terminal half-life of 2 to 3 weeks; therefore, its discontinuation results in 
slow elimination over several months. There is no available antidote for Avastin. Patients randomized in the combination arm will receive a to tal of 9 cycles of Avastin even if delays 
occur between doses; for these patients, the total time of participation in the trial may be longer 
than 24 weeks. For these patients requiring Avas tin infusions delays, evaluations scheduled by 
[CONTACT_389514]:   Week 0 or cycle 1   Week 3 or cycle 2   Week 6 or cycle 3   Week 9 or cycle 4   Week 12 or cycle 5   Week 15 or cycle 6   Week 18 or cycle 7   Week 21 or cycle 8   Week 24 or cycle 9  Adverse events requiring delays or permanent discontinuation of Avastin are listed in Table 1.  Regardless of the reason for holding study drug treatment, the maximum allowable length of treatment interruption is 2 months.

Letrozole (Femara®) is the hormonal agent that will be used in this trial.  Patients will receive 
2.5 mg PO daily until 1 day before surgery.  Dose of the hormonal agent will not be modified for 
this protocol.  Adverse events associated with these medications are provided in the package inserts ( www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2001/20726S006LBL.PDF).  The hormonal agent is 
commercially available and will not be provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
7.3 Other Concomitant Medications 
 
The reason(s) for treatment dosage, and dates of  treatment should be recorded in the source 
documents.  Concomitant medications should be repor ted to the investigator and will be recorded 
as instructed in the study specific case report forms.  Patients who experience Avastin-related temperature elevations or other infusion-related symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, dyphenhydramine, meperidine, or othe r medications as clinically indicated, 
including < 48 hours of treatment with corticoste roids.  Patients should receive full supportive 
care, including transfusions, antibiotics, anti-emetic s, etc. when appropriate.  Pre-trial supportive 
care will continue.  Unless there is a contraindication, patients with a history of atherosclerosi s or at high risk for 
atherosclerosis should be taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 mg PO a day) and/or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_63999] (75 mg PO a day) to prevent arterial thrombosis.  Unless there is  a contraindication, patients with a central venous 
line should be receiving warfarin (1 mg PO a day) to prevent venous thrombosis.  Patients

8.0 CLINICAL AND LABORATORY EVALUATIONS 
 
Patients will be monitored for safety and tole rability during and after the treatment period.  
Patients will undergo an assessment of tumor status  at baseline (screening) and at the completion 
of the first [ADDRESS_488157] be performed within  8 weeks prior to day 0 (except blood and urine 
tests which should be obtained within 4 weeks).  Results of tests or examinations done as 
standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 56 days prior to day 0 may be used rather than repeating tests.   
The following evaluations and procedures will be performed during the screening period :  
 
-  Signed informed consent.  -  Clinical evaluations: medical history, demogr aphics, weight and height, complete physical 
examination, vital signs and performance status.    
- Laboratory assessment: UA, urinary protein/cr eatinine ratio (24-hour urine collection if 
indicated), CBC with differential and platelet  count, serum chemistries (glucose, BUN, 
creatinine, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT), serum electrolytes (Na, K,Cl), INR.  
- Core needle biopsy of the tumor and of the unaffected breast (optional); samples for 
circulating tumor cells (Appendix I). 
 -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy when required.   - Estrogen and Progesterone receptor status.  - Her-2-neu by [CONTACT_9064] (Negative: IHC 0, 1 or 2+ or non-amplified by [CONTACT_4656]).  - Tumor assessments: Mammogram and breast u ltrasound are required.  PET/CT scan or [CT 
scan of chest, abdomen,  pelvis,  with bone s can] will be obtained.  If the scan shows disease 
outside the breast and/or the axilla, the patient will not be enrolled in the trial.

- Evaluation of the ejection fraction with an echocardiogram/MUGA. 
 
-  Concomitant medication assessment.  -  Patients who have satisfied basic eligibility  criteria will be assigned with a study patient 
number and the patient can proceed to be consented. After screening procedures are 
completed, the patient will be randomized. 
 
8.2 Evaluations During Treatment 
The following evaluations and proce dures will be performed during the treatment period :  (All 
assessments should be performed within 5 working days of the protocol-specified date). 
 -  Physical examination, vital signs, weight, and performance status on weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 
or until disease progression.     
 - For patients randomized to the Avastin arm: ur ine protein/creatinine ratio or urine dipstick

followed unless the patient requires following of adverse events. The following evaluations and 
procedures will be performed at early termination :  
 
- Clinical evaluations: Weight, physical examina tion (complete), vital signs and performance 
status.  There must be a complete and clear documentation of objective response or disease 
progression using the RECIST criteria.  Reason(s) for discontinuation must be documented. 
 - Laboratory assessment: UA (subjects found to have >
 2+ or greater proteinuria and/or urine

 - Tumor assessments: Mammogram and breast ultr asound.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_389470], abdomen, 
and pelvis, bone scan, and any other procedur e are not required per protocol but will be 
obtained if clinically indicated.  
 -  Concomitant medication assessment.  -  Assessment of adverse events (Appendix C and section 13).  If the patient has an ongoing 
toxicity, the patient should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  Serious and non-
serious adverse events occurring within [ADDRESS_488162] 
ongoing proteinuria (grade 3) at the terminati on visit will be monitored with 24-hour urine 
collection every [ADDRESS_488163]-dose evaluations.  The termination visit 
consists of all evaluations scheduled for the termination visit.  The primary reason(s) for 
discontinuation must be recorded on the appropr iate CRF page.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_147140] a 
patient from treatment.  Reasons may include, but are not limited to, the following: clinically significant deterioration, noncompliance, persistent grade 3 or 4 adverse event or any significant adverse event that compromises the patient’s ability  to participate in the study, requirement of a 
significant surgical procedure or radiation th erapy during the treatment period of the study, 
investigator’s determination that it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue participation, 
proteinuria greater than [ADDRESS_488164] an ongoing Avastin-related Grade 4 or serious adverse event at the time of discontinuation from study treatment will continue to be followed until resolution of the event or 
until the event is considered irreversible (see Section 7.1.3).  
10.0 STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Genentech and/ or the Breast Cancer Research Consortium have 
the right to terminate the study for the following reasons: the incidence or severity of adverse events indicates potential health hazard for patient s, subject enrollment is unsatisfactory, or data 
recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
11.[ADDRESS_488165]-menopa usal patients with new diagnosed stage II/III, 
ER/PR positive, Her-[ADDRESS_488166] cancer.  The randomization will be 2:1 combination 
versus single agent letrozole with a total of  75 patients (50 receiving the combination and 25 
receiving single agent.  The intent of the trial is not a comparison of th e two arms of the study 
but rather to estimate the pathologic complete re mission rate (pCR) of the combination therapy.  
Previous studies have demonstrated that the p CR rate of single agent letrozole is <1% ([ADDRESS_488167] 2008, 100:1380-1388).  A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_389471] a pCR of 12% (breast 
and nodes) and breast pCR of 16%.  In order to achieve a more accurate analysis of pCR rate, this trial in [ADDRESS_488168] errors of +
 0.052 and using the Blyth-Still-Cosella 
method provide a pCR rate and two-sided confid ence interval of 5.4% - 23.3% based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_369518] 12% pCR.   The single agent letrozol e 25 patient arm with projected <1% pCR rate 
would be expected to have no pCR events and the probability of observing one pCR event would 
be 22%.  The purpose of the single agent letrozol e arm is to characterize the pCR response as 
similar to the prior (historical control) trials of single agent neoadjuvant letrozole.  
  
 Page [ADDRESS_488169] deviation and range will be summari zed for continuous variables, and frequency 
(percentages) will be calculated for categori cal variables. The difference between the 
pathological complete responses and clinical re sponses will also be determined along with 95% 
exact confidence intervals about these differences in proportions.    Descriptive statistics will be calculated to summarize biomarker values from biopsies during pre- and post-therapy (6 weeks) for all patients.  Th e change between pre- and post-therapy for each 
biomarker will also be calculated and summarized  for each arm together with 95% confidence 
intervals. All toxicities will be recorded and summarized by [CONTACT_389516].  
12. ADMINISTRATIVE RULES OF THE PROTOCOL 
 12.[ADDRESS_488170] be submitted to the IRB at the investigator's site for approval. All revisions to the protocol will be provided to Genentech by [CONTACT_86736]. The Investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the 
protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_389472], except where necessary to eliminat e an immediate hazard(s) to study patients. 
Documentation of approval signed by [CONTACT_389517] I RB(s) must be sent 
tothe UAB Clinical trial Network Coordinato r (Pam Dixon fax [PHONE_8114]). If the revision is 
an Administrative Letter, Investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
12.[ADDRESS_488171] (IRB) Approval and Consent 
 Before study initiation, the Investigator must ha ve written and dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_8595], consent form , patient recruitment materials/process (e.g., 
advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to patients.  The Investigator 
should provide the IRB with reports, updates, and other information (e.g., Safety Updates, 
Amendments, Administrative Letters) according to regulatory requirements or Institution procedures. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_389473]-approvals must be submitted 
to UAB. UAB will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_389474].  It is expected that the IRB will have the prope r representation and function in accordance with 
federally mandated regulations. In obtaining and doc umenting informed consent, the investigator 
should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. Before recruitment and enrollment ont o this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each 
consent form must include all the relevant el ements currently required by [CONTACT_389518]. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient unde rstands the implications of participating in the 
study, the patient will be asked to give consen t to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001]-
approved consent form.  Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_12718] ’s legally acceptable representative, and by [CONTACT_389519]. Documentation of IRB approval must be 
on file before any patient can be registered. Registration begins with signed informed consent.  
12.4.[ADDRESS_488172] be provided to the UAB Clinical Trials Network Office:  • A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent • IRB membership list • CVs and medical licensure for the principal i nvestigator and any associate investigators who 
will be involved in the study

• A copy of the IRB-approved consen t form and HIPAA authorization 
• CLIA Laboratory certification and institution lab normal values 
 In addition, an executed subcontract must be in place at UAB.  A separate agreement with 
Genentech may be required for Avastin shipment.  
12.4.[ADDRESS_488173] Retention 
 Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms,  data correction forms or queries, source 
documents, Sponsor-Investigator corresponden ce, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory 
documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, I RB correspondence and approved signed patient 
consent forms). Source documents include all record ings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and all reports and records necessary fo r the evaluation and conduction of the clinical 
research study. Government agency regulati ons and directives require that all study 
documentation pertaining to the conduct of a c linical trial must be retained by [CONTACT_31821]. In the case of a study with a drug pursuing regulatory approval and marketing, these 
documents shall be retained for at least two year s after the last approval of marketing application 
in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region. In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study. If the Investigat or withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, 
retirement), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another 
Investigator, IRB). Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to Genentech. Records of the patient’s participation in this study will be kept confidential so far as permitted by [CONTACT_2371].  However, the patient’s doctor and his/her staff, representatives of Genentech, representatives of 
the Breast Cancer Research Consortium, the U.S. Food and Drug Admi nistration, and the IRB 
will be able to inspect patient records and have access to confidential information which 
identifies the patient by [CONTACT_2300].  Any publication of  data will not identify the patient by [CONTACT_2300].  
Should the patient’s medical record need to be reviewed by a foreign regulatory agency, a 
member of the IRB staff will observe the review so that the record is not removed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_530], or 
identifiable information recorded in any manner.

completion. 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_389476] s ite will be responsible for ensuring that all the 
required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms. Periodically, monitoring 
visits will be conducted and the Principal Inves tigator will provide access to his/her original 
records to permit verification of proper data en try. At the completion of the study, all case report 
forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_389520]/her final signature [CONTACT_252992].  
13.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
 13.1 Adverse Event Reporting and Definitions (See also Appendix D) 
 
In the event of an adverse event the first concern will be for the safety of the subject.    
13.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
 Adverse events should be followed to resolution or stabilization, and reported as SAEs if they 
become serious. This also applies to patients experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of investigational product or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study. Such patie nts should receive post-treatment follow-up as 
appropriate as it has been described throughout the protocol. If an ongoing AE changes in its 
severity or in its perceived relationship to study drug, a new AE should be completed.   
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
 SAEs require expeditious handling and repor ting to UAB to comply with regulatory 
requirements. Investigators are required to re port within 24 hours of investigator’s knowledge 
(MedWatch Form 3500 – Appendix D) to the princi pal investigator (UAB – Andres Forero), 
who will report to the FDA, UAB IRB and Ge nentech Drug Safety, ANY serious treatment 
emergent adverse event (SAE) as soon as possible.  Affiliate SAEs must be reported to local IRB 
according to their institutional guidelines. All SAEs  must be collected and reported until 30 days 
following patient discontinuation of dosing; if only limited information is initially available, 
follow-up reports are required. The original SAE form must be kept on file at the study site.  A SAE is any sign, symptom or medical conditi on that emerges during Avastin treatment or 
during a post-treatment follow-up period that (1) was not present at the start of Avastin treatment and it is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, OR (2) was present 
at the start of Avastin treatment or as part of  the patient’s medical history but worsened in 
severity and/or frequency during therapy, AND that meets any of the following regulatory serious criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389477] 46 of 87 Version 031411 
 
• Is disabling  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is medically significant or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
 
13.2 Reporting of Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
 
All SAEs should be recorded on a MedWatch 3500 Form (see Appendix D - can be accessed at: 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/MedWatch ) and faxed to UAB: 
Pam Dixon Phone: [PHONE_8113] Fax: [PHONE_8114]  And
 
Andres Forero Phone: [PHONE_8115] Fax: [PHONE_8116]  Once forms are reviewed, UAB will report to:  MedWatch [ADDRESS_488175] Rockville, MD [ZIP_CODE] Fax: 1-800-FDA-0178 ([PHONE_176])  And
 
 Genentech Drug Safety  Fax: ([PHONE_166] or ([PHONE_167]  And:
 
 UAB IRB   MedWatch 3500a Reporting Guidelines:
 
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, 
the report should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500 form:  
• Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy) 
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned) 
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if known 
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of  the adverse event to each investigational 
product and suspect medication 
  
 Page 47 of 87 Version 031411 
 
 
Follow-up information:   
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_15482]:  
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500a report and submitting it as follow-up 
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up with the 
original MedWatch 3500a form  
• Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including subject 
identifiers (i.e. D.O.B., initials, subject num ber), protocol description and number, if 
assigned, suspect drug, brief adverse event de scription, and notation that additional or 
follow-up information is being submitted  (The subject identifiers are important so that the new information is added to the correct initial report) 
 Occasionally the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Genentech may contact [CONTACT_389521], clarification, or current status of the subject for whom an adverse event was reported.   Assessing Causality:
 
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that Avastin caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidelines may be used. 
Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to Avastin administration makes a causal 
relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeu tic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 No: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to Avastin administration makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.

EVALUATION OF PROTEINURIA 
 
At Screening  
 
- Urinalysis is required for all subjects - Urinary protein/creatinine ratio is required for all subjects - [ADDRESS_488192] demonstrate < 1g of protein or a urinary protein/creatinine ratio < 1.0 to allow 
participation in the study.  
During Study (every 6 weeks for patients randomized to the Avastin arm)
 
 
 - Urinalysis with urinary protein/creatinine ratio or urine dipstick is required for all subjects   
Subjects found to have ≥ 2+ proteinuria by [CONTACT_389529]/or a urine protein/creatinine ratio >
 
1.[ADDRESS_488193] undergo a 24 hour urine coll ection for quantitation of protein and determination of creatinine 
clearance (urine volume required) 
Proteinuria 
Grade 3 protein/24 hou r If urinalysis indicates >  2+ protein, perform 24-hr urine 
collection for quantitation of protein. If Grade 3 
proteinuria discontinue Avas tin until proteinuria grade 2 
or better. 
Grade 4 (nephrotic syndrome) Discontinue the subject from Avastin. 
 
Study Termination  
 - Urinalysis with urinary protein/creatinine ratio or urine dipstick is required for all subjects is required for all subjects  
Subjects found to have  ≥ 2+ proteinuria by [CONTACT_389530]/ or urine protein/creatinine ratio >
 1.[ADDRESS_488194] 
undergo a 24 hour urine collection for quantitation of protein and determination of creatinine clearance 
(urine volume required)  
 
Follow-Up  
 For subjects who have ongoing grade 3 protein/24 hour urine at the termination visit will be monitored by 24 hour urine collection every 4 months for up to 1 year or until total 24 hour urine protein improves to grade 2 or better of protein/[ADDRESS_488195].

PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING A URINE PROTEIN / CREATININE RATIO  
 
1)  Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24 hour urine)  
2)  Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)  3)  Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)  4)  Divide #2 by #3 above: urine protein / creati nine ratio = protein concentration (mg /dL) / 
creatinine concentration (mg /dL) 
 The UPC directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hrs (i.e. a 
UPC of 1 should be equivalent to 1g protein in a 24hr urine collection)  Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinalyses, not 
dipsticks.  If protein and creatini ne concentrations are not routinely reported at an Institution, 
their measurements and reports may need to be requested.

3.0 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR CTN SITE STUDIES 
 
The P.I. will submit the phase I and/or phase  II studies to the UAB IRB as identified 
protocols to be carried out at affiliate s ite (CTN).  Once approved by [CONTACT_389540], the 
affiliate site P.I. will proceed with affiliate site IRB approval.  The UAB P.I. will provide 
UAB IRB with an amendment to the appr oved UAB protocol which will provide the 
affiliate site IRB approval, consent documents  and proposed date of initiation of the trial 
at the affiliate site.  When the amendment is  approved by [CONTACT_389540], the affiliate site 
can initiate patient accrual.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are reported by [CONTACT_389541] 24 
hours to the CTN Coordinating Center Manager by [CONTACT_6968] ( [EMAIL_7514]
) or 
by [CONTACT_6791] ([PHONE_8119].  The 24 hour paging num ber for the CTN Coordinating Center 
Manager is ([PHONE_8120], beeper #5904.  The CTN Manager is then responsible for 
reporting SAEs to the UAB I RB and protocol P.I. in accordance with study-specific 
requirements. SAEs occurring at CTN sites are reported to the UAB IRB as “non-UAB” events.   The CTN Coordinating Center Manager also ensures that the following are 
accomplished:  
• Develop and implement plans for monitoring and auditing CTN site studies  
• Provide initial protocol and consent documents to CTN sites 
• Coordinate CTN site initiation visits / teleconferences  
• Receive and evaluate documents from CTN sites and determine the need for 
further evaluation 
• Submit required regulatory documentation to the UAB IRB 
• Generate study-specific queries and develop resolutions 
• Perform monitoring at CTN sites 
• Provide for needed fiscal management  including development of CTN site 
budgets and ensure sub-contracts are negotiated 
• Provide for distribution of study-specific funds to CTN sites.

management; and 10) receipt, review , and filing of addendums to the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  Study specific data collection procedures are presented 
including: CRF guidelines; common errors and corrections; CRF update procedures; missed visits; data inquires; source documentation; record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; and disposition of CRFs.  Investigati onal agent procedures are reviewed 
including: dissemination of information to the CTN site research pharmacist; 
agent storage and accountability; pharmacy guidelines; and quality assurance.  A review of the CTN site Lead Investigator’s responsibility is carried out with the CTN site Lead Investigator.  The CT N site Regulatory Document Binder is 
reviewed including: CTN site IRB docum entation, study-specific approval letter, 
study-specific informed consent, advertisements and participant information sheets when applicable, annual renewal, and roster.  Assurance number, laboratory certification, laboratory norms , documentation of submission of the 
Investigator’s Brochure, and signature [CONTACT_389555].   A CTN site may not enroll a patient on a study until all of the regulatory 
documents have been received and CTN s ite IRB documentation is reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_389543]. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_488214] of a study at a CTN site are directed to the site Lead Investigator w ho consults with the CTN Director and / or 
the CTN Coordinating Center Manager when  necessary.  The P.I. (assisted by [CONTACT_389544]) is the primary contact [CONTACT_389545]-specific questions such as dose modifications, toxicities, and supportive care. The CTN 
Coordinating Center Manager is the primary contact [CONTACT_389546], regulatory documents, completi on of CRFs, data collection, and data 
submission.   The CTN office will maintain 100% of th e CRF’s with source documentation in 
the form of a shadow chart.   Monitoring of all CTN site studies (25% of patients) will be  conducted “off-site” at the CTN Coordinating Center using the CRFs and supporting source documents 
that are transmitted from the CTN site on a monthly basis.   
  Following each monitoring exercise, queries and/or requests for additional 
documentation are generated by [CONTACT_389547] 2 weeks of receipt of  the CTN site documents.  Subsequently, the CTN site 
reviews and responds to queries and implements the necessary corrective action(s).  Within two weeks, the CTN site submits query responses and, if 
appropriate, a written summary of corrective actions to the CTN Coordinating Center Manager.  When necessary, the CTN Coordinating Center Manager 
conducts “on-site” monitoring visits to provide staff education and to assist in implementing corrective action at the CTN site. 
 
2.3 Auditing of CTN Site Studies by [CONTACT_389548]-initiated studies are conducted on a yearly basis, 
within two to three months of the selected study’s UAB IRB renewal date.  Ten percent of the patient charts are audited.  Included in this audit are the CTN site “shadow charts” maintained at the CT N Coordinating Center.  Following the 
audit of the CTN site “shadow charts”, a summary of the audit findings are forwarded to the CTN site IRB, the UAB IRB, the CTN site Lead Investigator, the CTN Director and the CCC Associate Di rector for Clinical Research.  The 
CTN site Lead Investigator, in consultati on with the CTN director, has [ADDRESS_488215] udy-specific research data file (research 
chart) for study subjects enrolled into a study.  The research chart includes 
completed CRFs and copi[INVESTIGATOR_389495].  Completed CRFs are reviewed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_389549].  Any deviations from 
the study protocol are documented in th e study subject’s medical record and 
research chart.  Missing data is documented in the research chart.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_364500], other study-related documents, and source documents are faxed to the CTN Coordinating Center Manager on a monthly basis.    Failure to submit the required documents in  a timely fashion (within one week of 
the due date) results in a Letter of Notifi cation.  Subsequent failure to comply can 
result in the following:  
• Suspension of CTN site study subject accrual until all delinquent data is submitted to the CTN Coordinating Center 
• Permanent suspension of study subject accrual to a CTN site 
• Other action determined by [CONTACT_389550]. 
 
2.5  Adverse Event Reporting 
 
In cancer clinical trials, an Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable physical 
sign, symptom, significant laboratory test abnormality or disease that is 
temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment, procedure or 
device.  All AEs must be recorded on st udy-specific CRFs.  AE information is 
collected from the initiation of the treatment, procedure or use of a study 
device and continues until the treatment, procedure or use of a study device 
is stopped and follow-up is completed.  Severity is graded according to 
Common Toxicity Criteria.  The CTN site  Lead Investigator must evaluate 
the severity of each AE, assess causal relationships, determine the action to be taken and document the outcome.  The CTN site study-specific research 
nurse is responsible for documenting, filing, and reporting AEs on a weekly 
basis to the CTN Coordinating Center Manager, who in turns reports the AE at the next weekly CCC Clinical Trials Monitoring Committee meeting.   
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE th at 1) results in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81889]; 2) results in persistent or significant disability 
or incapacity; 3) results in death; 4) is  a cancer or congenital abnormality or 5) 
results in the development of drug dependence or abuse.  An AE must be considered an SAE when the nature or seve rity of the event is not consistent with 
the current Investigator’s Brochure.  CT N site SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_389551] C oordinating Center Manager by [CONTACT_389552] 86

to the CTN site IRB and to submit copi[INVESTIGATOR_389496].  It is the CTN Coordi nating Center Manager’s responsibility to 
report the SAE to the appropriate regulatory agency and / or industry sponsor.

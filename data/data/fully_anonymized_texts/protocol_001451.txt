 INTRODUCTION 
 BACKGROUND  
Suture Anchors are small fixation devices used in surgical procedures for attaching or reattaching 
tendons and ligaments to bone. The size and type of anchor use
density and the procedure performed. 
Suture anchors are made up of three components: the anchor - which is inserted into the bone; 
the eyelet  which is a hole or a loop in the anchor which the suture passes through to link the 
anchor to the suture; and the suture  which is attached to the anchor through the eyelet of the 
anchor. An anchor-receiving hole is first drilled in the bone at the desired point of tissue 
reattachment. A suture anchor is deployed in the hole using an appropriate installation tool. This 
effectively locks the suture to the bone, with the free end(s) of the suture extending out of the bone.  
Soft tissue is then moved into position over the hole containing the deployed suture anchor. As 
this is done, the free end(s) of the suture is (are) passed through or around the soft tissue so that 
the free end(s) of the suture reside(s) on the far (i.e., non-bone) side of the soft tissue. The suture 
is now used to tie the soft tissue securely to the bone. 
Smith & Nephew (S&N) offers a variety of suture anchors including several polyetheretherketone 
(PEEK) suture anchors soft tissue to bone repair. The PEEK devices included in this review are all 
single use, sterile devices comprised of machined component anchor bodies that are 
manufactured from PEEK-OPTIMA Polymer (LT1). This material meets ISO [ZIP_CODE] biocompatibility 
requirements for implant devices, bone/tissue contact, and permanent contact. The anchor tips 
are molded components which are also manufactured from PEEK-OPTIMA Polymer (LT3). PEEK-
OPTIMA polymers provide an ideal combination of strength, biocompatibility, revisability and 
inherent radiolucent characteristics. Smith & Nephew also provides a variety of reusable and

 SURGICAL TECHNIQUE  
The operative visit of this study is retrospective. The use of the PEEK Anchors (
RAPTORMITE ULTRA PK SL) in extremities was performed per standard 
of care at the participating study sites. 
 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL 
Investigators will screen all subjects that have undergone usage of the PEEK suture anchors in the 
extremities using only the existing information in the medical records. 
Investigators will conduct a chart review after IRB approval has been granted. All subjects whose 
chart undergoes the screening process will be documented on a Screening and Enrollment Log, 
with the reason for exclusion noted, if applicable. The Investigator or designee must notify the 
Sponsor upon subject enrollment. 
 SUBJECT POPULATION  
To minimize the potential for selection bias, Investigators will screen and subsequently enroll 
subjects (after fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria) on whom 
SPYROMITE and ULTRA PK SL in the extremities were implanted.  
Enrollment will be in sequential order based on the date of their surgical procedure with the 
investigational device, i.e. earliest to latest. 
 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
Subjects will be considered qualified for enrollment if they meet the following criteria: 
1. Subjects who have undergone extremity joint repair using the study devices. 
2. Subjects aged 18 years and older at the time of surgery.

 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
Any one (1) of the following criteria will disqualify a potential subject from participation in the 
study: 
1. Subject is entered in another investigational drug, biologic, or device study or has been 
treated with an investigational product within [ADDRESS_752750]-operative. 
2. Subjects who are < [ADDRESS_752751]'s source documents and noted on the Screening and Enrollment Log. 
 INFORMED CONSENT  
Study sites will obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB/Ethics Committee (EC)) approval for this study 
before any study specific activities are performed.  
Due to the retrospective nature of the study, a waiver of informed consent for study participation 
will be requested from the IRB/EC for those subjects who meet eligibility criteria as only 
retrospective data set will be collected for these subjects. No prospective visits will be performed. 
A waiver or alteration of the requirements for obtaining informed consent can occur under any of 
the following three provisions set forth by [CONTACT_573363]: 
Research in general: an IRB may waive or alter the requirement of informed consent under 45 CFR 
46.116(d), provided that the IRB finds and documents that all of the following four conditions are 
met:

2. the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants; 
3. the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and 
4. Whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent 
information after participation. 
If an IRB/EC waiver is not granted, then informed consent shall be obtained from all study subjects 
according to ISO [ADDRESS_752752], or their legally authorized representative, will then read , sign, 
and personally  date  the IRB/EC approved informed consent document(s) (see below for difficulties 
with reading and writing). Additionally, the individual who obtains consent from the subject will 
sign and date the informed consent document. A copy of the signed informed consent 
documentation will be provided to the subject, a copy will be placed in the subj
and the original filed in the Investigator Site File (ISF). 
If a subject refuses participation, no further information will be collected. Reason for exclusion 
should be noted on the Screening and Enrollment Log. 
 ENROLLMENT  
For screening, only information available in the medical records will be reviewed. Once a potential 
subject has been identified, all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria have been met, 
and the informed consent process has been completed or a waiver of consent has been granted

and follow-up considerations. The study is therefore not powered for any statistical hypothesis 
testing but to have sufficient number of subjects to be able to estimate a clinical success rate of 
91% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 80% to 100%.  
With an assumption of a 91% clinical success rate to be obtained in each of the PEEK anchors and 
a corresponding 95% CI between 80% and 100%, enrolling between 20 and 120 subjects for each 
is expected to provide between 15.2% to >95% probability, pending 
that there is sufficient volume of each type of anchor available. Thus, an overall minimum of 80 
and maximum of 480 subjects are to be enrolled into the study, pending that there is sufficient 
volume of each type of anchor available. Additionally, a minimum of 10 subjects will be enrolled at 
any investigational site.

 ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES 
Adverse Events (AE) related to the study implant, or procedure including Adverse Device Effects 
(ADE), Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADE), Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect 
([LOCATION_003]DE), and Device Deficiencies (DevD) occurring from the time of the surgery until revision or 
study completion must be recorded on the appropriate CRF and reported. If the event is known to 
have been previously reported to Smith & Nephew, this must be noted on the CRF. After 
enrollment, in addition to all adverse events related to the implant or the procedure, all serious 
adverse events (SAE), regardless of causality, must be recorded on the appropriate CRF and 
reported to the Sponsor, and IRB if necessary. Adverse events leading to a revision should be 
reported at all times regardless of causality. 
Adverse Device Effects (ADE) occurring after study completion will be handled as product 
complaints reportable by [CONTACT_573367]. 
 DEFINITIONS  
The categories of adverse events are shown in table 5. The definitions for each of these categories 
are given in the subsequent sections (see reference within the table).

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with the use of an Investigational 
Product (IP)/Ancillary Product, whether or not considered causally related to that IP/Ancillary 
Product. 
AE is used both to refer to AEs which are non-serious non-IP or procedure-related and as an 
umbrella term referring to adverse events of all classifications. 
14.1.[ADDRESS_752761] (ADE) 
An ADE is an adverse event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is related to the IP or the 
procedure.

POSSIBLE, PROBABLE, or DEFINITE relationship between the AE and the use of the IP 
or the procedure. 
14.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADE) 
An AE or ADE is considered a SAE or SADE if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, 
it: 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening ( NOTE -
an event/reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe). 
 Requires in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316886]. 
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is a medically important event or reaction. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573360]

events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
14.1.4 Anticipated/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (ASADE/[LOCATION_003]DE) 
An [LOCATION_003]DE is a serious ADE that meets any of the above definitions but is also considered, by [CONTACT_3786], to be caused by [CONTACT_316898], not previously identified in nature, severity or 
degree in the IFU. 
An Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (ASADE) is a serious ADE that does not meet the 
criteria for a [LOCATION_003]DE. 
14.1.5 Severity 
The severity of every AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_573368]. 
AEs should be classified as mild, moderate, or severe, regardless of whether or not the AEs are 
considered to be serious or non-serious. The classification should be based on the following 
definitions: 
Mild  -  An event is mild if the subject is aware of, but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom; 
Moderate - An event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough

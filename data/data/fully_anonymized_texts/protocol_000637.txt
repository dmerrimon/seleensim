Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words): 
Vascular inflammation, a central feature of atherosclerosis, participates in the initiation, 
perpetuation and instability of plaques. Multiple clinical trials of cholesterol lowering 
therapy with statins have demonstrated that reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) events are associated with reductions in both LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) 
and the systemic inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP). The Cardiovascular 
Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) investigates if an anti-inflammatory agent 
commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CV 
morbidity and mortality among patients with a prior myocardial infarction or 
angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease (GCO#13-1467).  
 
In this ancillary CIRT imaging study, we propose to use this well validated approach by [CONTACT_105]-
invasive serial FDG-PET/CT imaging in a subset of patients enrolled in the main CIRT trial to 
directly visualize vascular inflammation. Once the subjects are enrolled in the main CIRT trial, 
baseline imaging will be done and follow up imaging will be done approximately 8 months after 
the baseline imaging. To clarify, we anticipate on having the randomization visit to follow closely 
after the baseline imaging visit, which means that subjects will be coming approximately 8 
months after the randomization visit in the main CIRT Trial. 
18FDG-PET imaging data will be acquired, analyzed centrally and results incorporated 
into the main CIRT database. We hypothesize that LDM treatment will result in a 
significant decrease in plaque inflammation as measured by 18-FDG-PET/CT after 8 
months as compared to placebo.

inflammation, as assessed by [CONTACT_6789]-PET/CT imaging in patients with stable  coronary 
artery disease who are at increased risk. We will determine the effect of LDM on the 
change from baseline in the target (plaque) to background (blood) ratio (TBR) based on 
18-FDG uptake measured with PET/CT after 8 months of weekly dosing with LDM 
(pr
imary endpoint). 
 
To evaluate changes in imaging endpoints in relation to changes in systemic 
inflammatory biomarkers (especially high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). 
2) Background 
The NHLBI funded (Ridker 5U01HL101422) Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction 
Trial (CIRT) provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether a commonly used anti-
inflammatory agent used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can 
reduce CVD morbidity and mortality among patients with stable coronary artery disease . 
CIRT, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial among 7,000 
men and women with prior myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated 
multivessel coronary artery disease. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated over 
a three to four year period to usual care plus placebo or usual care plus LDM (average 
dose of 15-20 mg po/weekly. CIRT proposes that the reduction in CVD events with 
methotrexate derives from its effect on vascular inflammation, thus it is crucial to 
incorporate a measure of vascular inflammation imaging for confirmation of the primary 
mechanism of action underlying CIRT. As such, the direct evaluation of arterial 
inflammation would enhance the scientific value of the CIRT trial. 
 
The inclusion of the proposed vascular inflammation imaging substudy has widespread 
implications that will allow this imaging modality to serve as a surrogate measure of 
disease, and thereby [CONTACT_399509]-inflammatory effects. 
( Please see Protocol NIH CIRT imaging for more details -pages 104). 
Current protocol for the Main CIRT trial as well as CIRT imaging sub study are 
provided as an Appendix  
3) Setting of the Human Research 
The total study duration is 38-40 weeks which includes a pre-randomization phase (up to 
8 weeks), and a double-blind treatment phase (approximately 32 weeks). There will be 
four
 imaging  centers (Mount Sinai Medical Center, [LOCATION_001], NY, University Health 
Network, Ontario,  Canada, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011], MA, and University 
of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA), which will perform all the 
imaging for the surrounding referring centers. There will be recruiting centers in each 
region ([LOCATION_001], Toronto, and [LOCATION_011]) for 17 centers in total. For the NY region, the 7 
recruiting centers where the subjects will be identified and recruited will be Montefior e 
Medical Center ([CONTACT_399539]-PI), Winthrop University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Dr. DeLeon - PI),

Medical Center (UCSF) (Dr. P. Hsue-PI), and Clinton, Maryland ([CONTACT_399542]-PI). For the 
[LOCATION_011] region, the 5 recruiting centers are [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([CONTACT_399543]-
PI), Lahey Clinic ([CONTACT_399544]-PI), South Shore Internal Medicine ([CONTACT_399545]-PI), MGH-
Chelsea Health Care ([CONTACT_399546]-PI) and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center 
([CONTACT_19072]-PI).  For the Toronto region, the 5 recruiting centers are UHN/Toronto 
General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([CONTACT_399547]-PI), Scarborough General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399496] ([CONTACT_399548]-PI), Brampton Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([CONTACT_84137]-PI), Humber River 
Regional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([CONTACT_399549]-PI) and Sewa Ram Singal Professional Corp.-Finch site 
([CONTACT_399549]-PI). . Additional recruitment centers may be added in the future. 
 
 The Imaging Center at Mount Sinai will also act as the Imaging Data Coordinating 
Center for all 3 Imaging Centers. ( Protocol NIH CIRT imaging -page 111). All imaging 
scans will be sent to Mount Sinai for Data Analysis. UCSF will also be an imaging center 
for their own site and will send all data to Mount Sinai. 
(Please see Protocol NIH CIRT imaging for more details -pages 107-108). 
Current protocol for the Main CIRT trial as well as CIRT imaging sub study are 
provided as an Appendix  
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research 
The Mount Sinai research group has had excellent success in recruiting this type of 
patients in the [LOCATION_001] area. There will be four major recruiting centers in the New 
York region. The Imaging Center at Mount Sinai has collaborated with all the recruiting 
centers in the past on both NIH and pharmaceutical funded studies.  All personnel 
involved in the study are PPHS accredited and composed of experienced researchers.  
5) Study Design 
a) Recruitment Methods 
The recruiting centers will be responsible for identifying suitable subjects for the study, 
recruiting the subjects into the study, informed consent, blood work and arranging for 
transportation of the subjects to the imaging centers as part of the CIRT imaging 
substudy. This is a sub study of the parent NHLBI funded CIRT trial (Ridker 
5U01HL101422). Only subjects that are part of the main CIRT study and have consented 
to being approached for ancillary studies will be approached for recruitment into this 
CIRT imaging substudy.  In the main CIRT trial, pa tients are recruited from 300 to 400 
clinical sites (average of 20 randomized participants per site) in the U S and Canada, 
a
ll of whom have demonstrated expe rience in the identifi cation, randomi zation, and 
long-term f o llow-up of patients with cardiovascular disease. In CIRT, as of August

final imaging timepoint will be asked to go to their Imaging Center by [CONTACT_399515] 
2018 and/or till all final imaging visits are completed, as advised by [CONTACT_74379].  Subjects 
who have been on the Imaging substudy for [ADDRESS_503617] will be asked to verify with a physician insulin regiment for fasting and dieting 
needed prior to each imaging visit and provide study team with physician’s 
recommendations whether to continue with our imaging study. On the day of the visit, the 
subject will be able to proceed with the imaging only when fasting glucose is equal or 
less than 170 mg/dL and equal or greater than 80 mg/dL. This will be verified at our site 
prior to the scan by [CONTACT_399516] i.v. If the fasting blood glucose is less than 80 mg/dL 
each subject will be instructed to eat a snack or we will provide sugar cubes. Once fasting 
blood glucose is above 80 mg/dL, we will proceed with the imaging. 
g) Specimen Banking 
Ancillary Study Data Collection. This ancillary proposal will additionally collect the 
following data from each study subject participating in the imaging ancillary study 
1) PET/CT Imaging data in the form of DICOM images.  
2) Blood draw for evaluation of inflammatory biomarkers. These samples will also be 
stored in a coded fashion. The blood will only be stored for the purpose of the trial. 
3) Blood draw for evaluation of pre scan glucose. This is an instant test and the data are 
not stored. This information is used only to determine if the subject is eligible for FDG 
injection at the time of imaging or if the imaging test needs to be postponed. Patients with 
a fasting glucose of >170 mg/dl will need to be rescheduled for an on-trial FDG-PET 
scan at a later date (p. 112 of other protocol) 
4) Only the PIs of the imaging sub study and the main CIRT trial and their authorized 
representatives will have access to the code that links the imaging and blood data back to 
each individual subject. The linking files will be stored securely on a hard disk in Co-
investigator’s office.  
 
(Please see  Protocol NIH CIRT imaging for more details-page 119).  
h) Data Management and Confidentiality 
Image identifiers (blinded data) will be removed by [CONTACT_399517]/CT Core Laboratory using either secure 
FTP or by [CONTACT_399518]. All Images will be coded and be identified 
only by a study ID number. All coded image data will also be stored at the central 
laboratory for imaging (Mount Sinai) on encrypted hard disks specific to this trial (CIRT 
image data repository). Only study personnel authorized to evaluate images, the imaging 
data manager and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_399501]. All imaging data and meta-
analysis files are also stored on the same encrypted hard disk (image data repository). 
The image data repository has access controls and an audit trail feature built in using Mac 
Hg version control. This system is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.

i) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects 
Data for the substudy will be linked to the parent database by [CONTACT_399519]. The Mount Sinai imaging data coordinating center has programs, policies 
and procedures in use at all times to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data. 
Direct identifiable variables such as name, address, DOB, MRN, SSN, that can link the 
data to a person's identity will not be sent to us from the imaging sites. Only coded data is 
received at the core laboratory and is identifiable only by [CONTACT_399520]). Research data 
files will be stored using this ID as the unique identifier. The linking code file which 
contains the linking information between the unique identifier and the direct identifiable 
variables will be stored in a different location than the de-identified and identifiable 
information and is available only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_399502].

The investigators and research team are experienced in conducting clinical trials, trained 
(having met the IRB’s educational requirements) and knowledgeable about the protocol, 
and are therefore qualified to review safety updates, monitor subjects for adverse events 
and assess their health and well-being during the trial. The additional monitor is also an 
expert in imaging and will be responsible for the safety of the subjects during their 
imaging visits. The co-investigators and the research team are responsible for the safety 
and welfare of the subjects and for conducting the trial as outlined in the protocol.  
3. List the specific items that will be monitored for safety (e.g., adverse events, 
subject compliance with the protocol, drop outs, etc.).  
Additional items that will be monitored during their imaging visit will be a chance of 
swelling, pain, bruising, infection or redness during blood draw; subject compliance 
which will also be monitored by [CONTACT_423]'s main site and subjects will also be 
monitored for reactions during the injection of the 18-FDG radiotracer although there are 
no known side effects with the use of the agent. 
4. Indicate the frequency at which ACCUMULATED safety and data information (items 
listed in number 3 above and interim analysis of efficacy outcomes) will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_2037](s) or the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Although this information 
must be reviewed at least annually, the higher the study risks, the more frequently 
reviews must be scheduled.  
Subjects with IDDM should consult with their physician prior enrolling in our 
imaging sub-study. The visit preparation form called “Getting ready for your 
visit” includes all details as to fasting, low carbohydrate diet restriction as well 
medication and insulin requirements.   
Subjects will have regularly scheduled visits with the ir main site during which the 
research staff will carefully assess subjects for any signs or symptoms of drug toxicity, in 
addition to the occurrence of any trial endpoints. A questionnaire designed to capture 
information about drug toxicity (including symptoms of a pulmonary, infectious, 
gastrointestinal, hematologic, dermatologic, and other toxicities), intercurrent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and elective or planned surgical procedures will be administered to all 
subjects. 
Study algorithms will combine data from recent laboratory safety evaluations with 
subject's reported symptoms to determine study drug dosing and/or cessation, including 
sham placebo dose adjustments. Responsible physicians will be informed of any changes 
in the study medication dosing. Adverse events, patient symptoms, laboratory 
abnormalities, or other reasons for discontinuation of or reduction in dose of study drug  
will be collected through electronic case report forms and monitored centrally by [CONTACT_219001]. A Medical Monitoring program will be developed and will help identify potential 
adverse drug reactions to the study medication. Study coordinators will be given 
instructions to contact [CONTACT_399521]. The Medical Monitor will  be on call 24 hours a day 7 days 
each week.

5. Where applicable, describe rules which will guide interruption or alteration of the 
study design.  
The principal features of the study design and of the plan for statistical analysis of the 
data are outlined in the protocol. Any changes in these principal features will require a 
protocol amendment.  
6. Where applicable, indicate dose selection procedures that will be used to 
minimize toxicity. 
Risks associated with 18-FDG-PET/CT: 
There are no known side effects with the use of the 18-FDG radiotracer. The procedure 
involves a single vein puncture for FDG administration. PET/CT scanning is widely used 
in oncology and cardiology. The metabolic tracer FDG is very safe with no potential for 
allergy. The radiation dose for the PET/CT scan would be the same as the background 
exposure of living in [LOCATION_001] City for 1 year. The total effective whole body dose 
(TEDE) from a single PET study is [ADDRESS_503618] portion of the PET 
scan adds another 70 mRem to the TEDE. The resulting effective total body dose is 770 
mRem, which compares with a 100 mRem yearly recommended limit for exposure for 
the general public and 5,000 mRem yearly limit for persons who work with radiation, 
established by [CONTACT_399522] (NRC). The critical organ, which is 
the organ which will receive the maximum dose and exceed the TEDE for FDG is the 
urinary bladder, which will receive [ADDRESS_503619] any specialized grading system that will be used to evaluate adverse 
events (e.g., National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria).  
To ensure safe and effective use of nuclide imaging, a rigorous quality assurance (QA) 
protocol of the imaging tools and integration of the imaging data is currently in place 
under the guidance of the respective radiation safety offices of the participating 
institutions. Overall, the goal of this QA program is to identify and minimize the sources 
of uncertainties and errors, taking into consideration the economic, medical, legal, and 
regulatory implications. The PET-CT scanners will comply with all The National 
Electrical Measurement Association (NEMA) standards and will be tested on a routine 
basis for compliance. The minimum dose of 18-FDG for adequate image quality will be 
used in all subjects.

9. Should a temporary or permanent suspension of your study occur, in addition 
to the PPHS, indicate to whom (NIH, FDA, sponsor, IRB) will you report the 
occurrence. 
Temporary or permanent suspension would be reported to the NHLBI and to all the sites. 
Data Safety Monitoring 
For the Imaging substudy, communication with the collaborating Mount Sinai co-
investigators will be conducted via bi-weekly teleconferences and quarterly meetings. 
Confidentiality of subject data will be protected as previously described. 
Unanticipated problems from the other study sites will be discussed at the 
teleconferences. Urgent problems will be immediately addressed by [CONTACT_399523]. Plan for reporting unanticipated events that 
cause risk of harm to subjects or others will be reported to the PPHS in accordance with 
PPHS policies on reportable information. 
The DSMB was constituted by [CONTACT_399524]: 1) physicians with specific expertise in the clinical management of 
cardiovascular disease 2) a biostatistician with specific expertise in the design, analysis, 
and safety monitoring of multi-center clinical trials 3) a medical ethicist, and 4) a 
physician with specific expertise in rheumatologic disease. The DSMB will oversee the 
main CIRT trial as well as the CIRT Imaging Study and the physician with expertise on 
rheumatologic disease will be from the Brigham and Women's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399504]. [CONTACT_399550] who is the PI [INVESTIGATOR_399505]. Rosenson who is the 
co-investigator of the CIRT Imaging Study will take part in the semiannual review.  
The Committee members will collect and review the safety data every 6 months and be 
responsible for review of: 
a) study recruitment goals and tracking of enrollment;  
b) presentation of spreadsheets for data analysis; 
c) adverse and reportable events as defined by [CONTACT_473]; 
As of 4/2/18, enrollment has ended due to early termination of the main CIRT Trial.  
There will  no longer be any DSMB meetings.

Participation in this imaging study is voluntary. The subjects can withdraw at any time by 
[CONTACT_305184] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the study coordinators. Although the subjects can withdraw from 
the imaging study, they can still continue to participate in the CIRT main trial. 
6) Risks to Subjects 
Risks associated with 18-FDG-PET/CT: 
 
There are no known side effects with the use of the 18-FDG radiotracer. The procedure 
involves a single vein puncture for FDG administration. PET/CT scanning is widely used 
in oncology and cardiology. The metabolic tracer FDG is very safe with no potential for 
allergy. The radiation dose for the PET/CT scan would be the same as the background 
exposure of living in [LOCATION_001] City for 1 year. The total effective whole body dose 
(TEDE) from a single PET study is [ADDRESS_503621] portion of the PET 
scan adds another 70 mRem to the TEDE. The resulting effective total body dose is 770 
mRem, which compares with a 100 mRem yearly recommended limit for exposure for 
the general public and 5,000 mRem yearly limit for persons who work with radiation, 
established by [CONTACT_399522] (NRC). The critical organ, which is 
the organ which will receive the maximum dose and exceed the TEDE for FDG is the 
urinary bladder, which will receive 5900 mRem. This dose is well within the 50,000 
mRem limit for a single organ, established by [CONTACT_399525]. While at this level, this kind of 
radiation exposure has not been shown to cause malignancies, this possibility can never 
be excluded. There are no other known side effects with the use of FDG as a PET agent. 
 
Risks associated with venipuncture and blood draw: During the collection of the blood 
samples, there is a chance of swelling, pain, bruising, infection, or redness at the site 
where the blood is drawn. Also, there is chance that the subject may feel faint.  
 
(Please see  Protocol NIH CIRT imaging for more details-page 120-121).  
 
Risks of Fasting:  If the subjects feel disoriented or dizzy, the coordinator will ask the 
subject to lie down until they regain their composure and will be given water. Their vital 
signs will be monitored until they have stabilized. If no improvement is seen, the subjects 
will be referred to the Co-PI, [CONTACT_399551] who is the MD in this study for further 
management and the scan will be rescheduled. 
 
To prevent such occurrences from happening, the coordinator will make sure of the 
following: 1) Remind subjects to come on time or enough time for the preparations 
before the scan; 2) That there is no delay in the scheduled imaging scan and that the dose 
is available and ready; 3) A coordinator be present with the subject to monitor the overall 
condition of the subject to undergo the scan. Once injected with the FDG and before the 
scan, the coordinator will periodically check on the subject to check his overall status.

8) Potential Benefits to Subjects 
This CIRT imaging sub study has the potential to provide valuable information with 
regard to the inflammatory status of the vessel walls of the subjects participating in this 
trial. This may provide mechanistic insights into the role of methotrexate in reducing 
cardiovascular inflammation and thereby [CONTACT_399526]. There 
may however not be any direct benefit to the subject. 
(Please see Protocol NIH CIRT imaging for more details -page 122-123). 
 
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
The subjects will be recruited at several different hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  After the recruitment, they 
will be referred to the Imaging center in their geographic area for their imaging.  The 
imaging centers will not be directly involv ed in recruiting the subjects. When patient 
consents to the study, his/her name, address, phone numbers, date of birth, medical record 
number will be collected and kept with the informed consent form in their respective 
recruiting centers. The subject will also sign a consent form at the imaging centers for the 
imaging and other study related procedures.   Once the subjects are recruited and referred 
to the imaging center for imaging, the following measures will be taken to ensure subject 
privacy.  The study treatment and procedures will be thoroughly explained to them in a 
private office/area, at a time of mutual convenience to both subject and investigator, by 
[CONTACT_85842]. All their questions will be addressed in a simple language so that the 
interested subjects can adequately understand the rationale for the study as well as 
potential risks and benefits prior to consenting. Once the subject has agreed to participate 
in the study, they will be asked their preferences regarding mode of contact [CONTACT_399527].  Their wishes will be respected by [CONTACT_63785].  All conversations will be held in a professional manner 
and in a manner that maintains subject privacy. 
If subject requests the research images, they could be provided.  However, these images 
will contain their private information and they will be responsible for protecting them and 
any future use of them. 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects 
Subjects will also receive  per imaging visit for a total of for two visits for their 
time. In the case that subjects do not complete the ir scan, but do have blood drawn, they 
will still be compensated the . Subjects’ travel will be arranged by [CONTACT_88060].  If 
subjects use their own form of transportation, they will be reimbursed for the 
transportation cost for the imaging visit upon providing receipts, either by [CONTACT_399528].

12) Cons
ent Process 
Once the subject has agreed to participate in the main study and signed the main consen t 
form, and has agreed to be approached for ancillary studies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_399506]. If the subjects agree to participate in imaging substudy, the research staff of 
the main clinical site will consent the subject for the imaging substudy at their center. 
This will be done prior to reviewing the subjects’ medical records to ensure eligibility for 
the imaging substudy.  If the subject meets the eligibility criteria for the imaging 
substudy, staff at the recruiting center will contact [CONTACT_399530]. The research staff of the imaging center will then 
contact [CONTACT_399531]. The consent form from the imaging center may be sent to 
the subject either by [CONTACT_399532]. The imaging center research staff will also over the phone go over 
any questions on the consent form and verify that the subject would be willing to 
participate in the imaging substudy. Consent at the imaging center will be obtained by [CONTACT_42020]-Investigator and/or designated research staff in a private office on a date or time prior 
to baseline scanning being performed. A consent form from the imaging center for this 
study will be given to the subject if it has not been given previously. Subjects can read 
the form on the day of the scan. All questions will be answered and the consent form will 
be signed if the subject wishes to participate.  To ensure participant understanding, the 
consent form will be thoroughly discussed with the subject, section by [CONTACT_68979].  If any 
questions arise, the coordinator or principal/ coinvestigator will answer their questions 
until they have a clear understanding of what is expected of them if they participate.  
Subjects will be asked to provide in their own words a statement of their understanding of 
the risks and procedures of the study, and the general concept of the study.  Subjects must 
clearly understand the potential risks and benefits before signing the consent. 
Prior to collecting study data, the following details will be explained to the participant: 
(1) that the study represents a research effort, (2) that participation is voluntary, and there 
is no penalty for withdrawal, (3) there are no costs to the patient for participation, (4) 
potential risks and benefits for participation and (5) contact [CONTACT_399533]. Patients will be informed of the purpose of the study, the need to be available 
for questionnaires and medical tests, and of their options to accept or refuse entry into the 
study without affecting their clinical care. All sources of research materials will be in the 
form of medical records, blood work, and imaging studies.  The consent form at the 
recruitment center and the imaging center describe the same procedures and are 
essentially similar but will be approved by [CONTACT_399534].

Duration of Exposure  All subjects will complete  either  1 month of transcutaneous spi[INVESTIGATOR_503437] (TS)  or temporary epi[INVESTIGATOR_503438] (ES) 
enabled  rehabilita tion sessions. Subjects will then  be followed for 
an additional [ADDRESS_648283] injury (SCI). The purpose of this trial is to improve the scientific 
understanding of how two electrical stimulation techniques, one which delivers electricity to 
the skin surface over the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (transcutaneous spi[INVESTIGATOR_503439] (TS) ) and another which 
implants temporary percutaneous  electrodes i nto the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503440] 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_503438] (ES)),  facilitate spi[INVESTIGATOR_503441] . Furthermore, we hope to determine responders 
versus non responders to spi[INVESTIGATOR_503442]- specific motor training following a 
condensed rehabilitation program as well as identify retained effects following [ADDRESS_648284] 
reported positive outcomes, such as regained control of leg movement (Gerasimenko, Lu, et al. 2015; P. S. H. PhD et al. 2011; Angeli et al. 2014; P. J. G. PhD et al. 2017; Gad et al. 2017)  and cardiovascular improvements (Phillips et al. 2018; Harkema, Ditterline, et al. 
2018; West et al. 2018) . Independent investigations of either TS  or ES have yielded some 
knowledge of the interactions between the electric field and spi[INVESTIGATOR_503443] (Minassian, Persy, Rattay, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_61813], et al. 2007; Minassian, Persy, Rattay, Dimitrijevic, et al. 2007; Danner et al. 2016; Hofstoetter et al. 2018; Sayenko, Atkinson, Floyd, et al. 2015; Sayenko et al. 2014; Sayenko, Atkinson, Dy, et al. 2015; Rattay et al. 2000; Danner et al. 2013; Capogrosso et al. 2013) . 
 To summarize, the paradigms used to characterize basic electrophysiological responses to stimulation in prior studies differed significantly from those used to facilitate functional movements in participants with lower extremity paralysis, specifically 
stimulation intensity and frequency. Therefore, there is a gap in knowledge of the electrophysiological and biomechanical outcomes produced by [INVESTIGATOR_285610] -enabling TS 
and/or ES waveforms. Further,  there is a lack of knowledge of  the functional impact of  
brief rehabilitation with spi[INVESTIGATOR_503444]. Finally, the extent to which stimulation -related changes are retained  following the interve ntion 
is unknown. This protocol describes the experiments we will carry out to address this gap in knowledge of the interactions of  either  TS or  ES over the course of brief rehabilitation  
periods . This clinical trial will be carried out in accordance with the procedures described in 
this protocol, applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations, and Mayo Clinic policies and procedures. All study procedures will be performed at Mayo Clinic’s campus  in [COMPANY_002]ster, 
Minnesota . 
1.[ADDRESS_648285] injury  
Severe SCI  results in permanent loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions below the 
level of injury, leading to in catastrophic, lifelong changes in quality of life for SCI survivors. In the [LOCATION_002] of America, nearly 300,000 people are living with neurological deficits due to SCI (National Spi[INVESTIGATOR_223645] 2017) . The effects of SCI are 
defined relative to physical and functional characteristics. It is well accepted that tr auma to 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_503445], spi[INVESTIGATOR_503443], and peripheral end organs, impairing 
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.[ADDRESS_648286] networks located below the lesion (Kandel 2013) . 
A systematic review of studies that directly surveyed people with SCI found that the major 
priorities of functional recovery were: motor function (arm/hand for tetraplegia and mobility for paraplegia), bowel, bladder and sexual function, as well as a des ire to improve 
psychosocial health (Simpson et al. 2012) . 
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_503446]. Specifically, Harkema and colleagues reported that, after months of rehabilitation with ES, voli tional control of 
joint-specific muscles and independent standing were achieved by [CONTACT_503573] (Harkema et al. 2011; Angeli et al. 2014) .Recently, we reported that ES 
enabled control of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_503447] , which over the course of rehabilitation, 
translated to independent standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Grahn  et al. 2017; Gill et al. 2018) . In 
addition to reports of ES enabling lower extremity motor functions, improvements in upper extremity (Lu et al. 2016) , cardiovascular (Harkema et al. 2018; West et al. 2018; Harkema, 
Wang, et al. 2018; Aslan et al. 2018) , and urologic functions (Herrity et al. 2018)  have been 
reported. 
 In parallel investigations, electrical stimulation applied to the skin surface over the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (i.e., TS) has emerged from prior use as a neurophysiological tool to interrogate spi[INVESTIGATOR_503448], 
(Danner, 2016; Sayenko, 2015; Sayenko, 2015; Krenn, 2017; Andrews , 2015; Roy, 2014) to 
a non- invasive approach to facilitate spi[INVESTIGATOR_503449] (Inanici et al. 2018; Gad et al. 2018; Gerasimenko, Lu, et al. 2015; Gad et al. 2017) . Similar to ES, TS  has recently been shown to improve cardiovascular 
(Phillips et al. 2018)  and urologic functions (Gad et al. 2018) . 
 Pathophysiology relevant to potential study treatment action  
Evidence from human cadavers suggests that even in cases diagnosed as complete loss of function below the level of SCI, as defined by [CONTACT_102098][INVESTIGATOR_329248]- A (AIS -A), a portion of neural tissue commonly remains intact across the 
injury site (Kakulas 1984) . These intact tissues may transmit non -specific supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_503450] (Dimitrijevic et al. 1983) . The unique electrophysiological 
characteristics as sociated with this injury profile have led to an injury description known as 
“discomplete SCI” (Dimitrijevic et al. 1983; McKay et al. 2004; Sherwood et al. 1992) . The 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_503574][INVESTIGATOR_503451] a “functional”  state of excitability in order to properly 
receive signals transmitted across the discomplete SCI and to produce functional outputs (Grahn  et al. 2017; Gill et al. 2018; Taccola et al. 2018) .   
 TS and ES interactions with spi[INVESTIGATOR_503452] (Capogrosso et al. 2013; Danner et al. 2015; Rattay et al. 2000; Danner et al. 2011)  and basic properties of the evoked spi[INVESTIGATOR_503453] (Sayenko et al. 2015; Sayenko et al. 2014; Sayenko et al. 2015; Danner et al. 2016; Hofstoetter et al. 2018) . However, the stimulation paradigms used in prior studies were 
focused on eliciting motor potentials vi a single stimulus pulses in order to establish a basic

in subjects with  SCI).   
 Description of the population to be studied  
This study will include adult humans that sustained a traumatic SCI  at least one year before 
trial enrollment. To qualify for this study, SCI severity must be previously diagnosed with  an 
AIS classified injury. One participant will be enrolled from each AIS classification ( A, B, C, 
and D ) for each intervention. All injuries must be located at or above the  tenth thoracic 
vertebrae. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided within the appropriate section of this protocol.

landmark report that after months of training, ES facilitated intentional control of joint-specific muscles and independent standing by a human with motor complete paraplegia (Harkema et al. 2011) . The same research group successfully replicated their results in three 
additional subjects (Rejc et al. 2015; Rejc et al. 2017; Angeli et al. 2014) . Based on these 
results, we initiated a clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and in 2017, we reported successful replication of Harkema et al., along with additional outcomes (Grahn et al. 2017) . Based on 
observations made during [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], we have designed this protocol to gain additional scientific knowledge with respect to mechanisms by [CONTACT_503576].   
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.7 
 
Page 11 of 46 
Kristin D. Zhao, Ph.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  In addition to studying ES as described in this protocol, we intend to gather comparative data 
from the non- invasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_503460] (TS). Prior evidence has shown that TS generates patt erned motor activity 
and limb movements in healthy humans (Gerasimenko et al. 2016; Gerasimenko et al. 2015; Minassian et al. 2007; Minassian et al. 2007) . More recently, TS has been reported to enable 
motor function in humans with SCI (Inanici et al. 2018; Gerasimenko, Lu, et al. 2015) . 
  Our Mayo team recorded preliminary TS data in two subjects during supi[INVESTIGATOR_503461]. TS -evoked responses were recorded during low -frequency TS to investigate 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_503462]. We  compared 
responses across TS  and ES. Preliminary data indicate smaller latency from stimulation to 
response in ES when compared to TS , indicating different mechanisms of action may 
underlie each approach. However, more subjects need to be investigated wit h a more 
structured study design to determine key differences between TS  and ES. Completion of the 
proposed experiments in this protocol will provide data that can be used to improve the scientific understanding of how each technique enables function after SCI. This knowledge will be used to design future investigations that f ocus on safety and therapeutic efficacy of 
TS and ES. 
1.4 Study Rationale and Risk Analysis ( Risk s to Benefits  Ratio)  
1.4.[ADDRESS_648288] suited for ES  through a clinical service line . 
1.4.2 Anticipated Risks  
Risks associated with rehabilitation:  
In combination with TS  and ES, the rehabilitation techniques used during this study will 
focus on maximizing independence, load bearing, body position, and kinematics during motor tasks while providing the minimum amount of trainer assistance and body weight support necessary t o safely perform tasks. Risks associated with daily training include skin 
irritation and minor bruising from pressure applied during trainer assistance and body weight support, musculoskeletal discomfort, fatigue, and bladder or bowel incontinence due to 
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.[ADDRESS_648289] gravity, specifically transitioning from sit to stand quickly.    
Risks associated with weight -bearing tasks:  
Risks include muscle soreness, fatigue, skin irritation, fracture, changes in blood pressure, 
and potential for a fall.  
 
Risks associated with TS : 
Skin irritation due to electrical current passing through human tissue, skin irritation due to 
adhesives used to apply skin surface electrodes, discomfort or abdominal tightness during TS, increased or decreased spasticity, bowel or bladder incontinence, shortness of breath, 
muscle soreness, or fatigue may occur . Autonomic dysreflexia is a risk for those with mid-
thoracic or higher -level injuries. Skin irritation or burns may occur during high- amplitude 
stimulation and/or prolonged stimulation sessions ; skin breakdown may also occur as a result 
of this stimulation, with ensuing infection being a potential risk.  
Risks associated with temporary percutaneous implantation of ES  electrode leads :
 
ES electrodes  will be implanted via commonly used percutaneous implantation techniques 
for FDA -approved treatment of medically refractory pain conditions. Therefore, the risks 
associated with percutaneous implantation of the ES  system for this study match the risks 
associated with ES system  implantation for treatment of FDA -approved conditions.  
 
• Undesirable changes in stimulation may occur over time. These  changes in 
stimulation are possibly related to cellular changes in  tissue around the electrodes, 
changes in the electrode position, loose  electrical connections and/or lead failure.  
• Placement of a lead in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503463] a surgical procedure that  may expose the 
patient to risks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865], hematoma,  infection, spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710], and/or paralysis.  
• Radicular chest wall stimulation.  
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) leakage.  
• Persistent pain at the  electrode site or receiver  site.  
• Seroma at the incision site , as well as serosanguinous drainage . 
• Implant migration.  
• Allergic or rejection response to implant m aterials.  
• Lead migration and/or local skin erosion.  
• Paralysis, weakness, clumsiness, numbness, or pain below the level of  implantation.  
 
Risks associated with ES following implantation:  
Hardware malfunction, discomfort, or abdominal tightness during ES, increased or decreased spasticity, bowel or bladder incontinence, shortness of breath, muscle soreness, or fatigue may occur during ES . Autonomic dysreflexia is a risk for those with mid- thoracic or higher -
level injuries.  
 
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.[ADDRESS_648290] s 
will be rigorously screened in the same fashion as clinical patient by [CONTACT_503577] . Earplugs will also be provided to keep MRI noise within a safe audible range . Due 
to the potential for tissue heating, image artifacts, induced voltages in the neurostimulator or 
leads, and lead dislodgement, MRIs will not be obtained after epi[INVESTIGATOR_503464].  
 Risks associated with Tran scranial magnetic stimulation  
Transcranial magnetic stimulation is electrical pulses from the magnet to the brain . Risks are 
possible hearing changes, headache, and a chance of heating on the skull where the magnet is placed.  
Risks associated with electromyography and electroneurography
 
Risks involved with EMG include skin irritation or allergic reaction from the adhesive used to apply sensors . Additionally, electroneurography carries the risk of  pain and discomfort from 
needle placement , and infection at the needle stick site . 
Risks associated with urodynamic studies  
Urodynamic studies may carry the risk of autonomic dysreflexia, mild irritation of the urethra, and infection.  
 Steps taken to minimize the occurrence and severity of associated risks:  
Trained study staff and medical technicians will directly oversee all tasks . Body weight  
support, a safety gait belt, and other safety measures as necessary will be utilized to lessen the risks involved with rehabilitation and weight -bearing tasks . Transcutaneous electrode 
sites will be checked routinely throughout rehabilitation sessions, and if skin irritation or damage is observed, no further stimulation will occur until the site has healed. To mitigate risks in general, the protocol will be conducted as  stated, medical professionals will be 
consulted, and care will be provided to address any study- related concerns that arise. All 
members of the research team will be trained to identify the occurrence of risks related to this study. If risk occurrence is observed, study- related activities will be halted  until appropriate 
medical care is given and it is deemed safe for the subject  to continue study- related activities. 
Because the interventions have been used for individuals with spi[INVESTIGATOR_503465], we do not anticipate any serious adverse events in this study. However, if they do occur, serious adverse events will be reported to the PI, medical monitor, IRB,  and FDA within the appropriate reporting timeframes. Adverse events will be 
reported to the PI, the site medical monitors IRB, and FDA within the appropriate reporting timeframes.  
1.4.[ADDRESS_648291] is approximately 6 
months. During the 6 months, subjects will complete either TS  rehabilitation sessions for the 
1 month, or ES  rehabilitation sessions for 1 month. After 1 month of either TS or ES , 
subjects will be followed for an additional 4 months for follow- up assessments . ES electrodes 
will be removed following  1 month of rehabilitation sessions.   
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
We propose to compare motor activity and clinical outcomes over the course of 1 month of TS or ES in combination with physical rehabilitation.  
 2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary outcome data collected will be used to compare spi[INVESTIGATOR_503466] -enabled motor tasks in persons with 
chronic motor complete paralysis of the lower extremities due to traumatic SCI.  
 2.2 Secondary Objective  
Quantify changes in motor performance metrics over the course of 12 motor rehabilitation sessions with transcutaneous or percutaneous epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 General Design  
This is a p ilot study that will include a total of 8 subjects with chronic, motor complete or 
incomplete  paralysis below the level of SCI. All subjects will complete  either  1 month of TS  
or ES  driven physical rehabil itation sessions  (Table 1) . All subjects will then be followed for 
an additional  [ADDRESS_648292] participation

Subjects will undergo a screening phase oriented to identify conditions that could potentially represent a higher than the expected risk for conducting this study.   To visualize electrode positioning of the ES neurostimulator system , fluoroscopy and spi[INVESTIGATOR_503468]. To limit adverse events that could result from operating the neurostimulator device, stimulation parameters will be selected within safe ranges as provided by [CONTACT_3455] ’s specifications of ES pulse generators . Specifically, 
we will deliver stimulation within the following ranges:   ES parameters: p ulse width 50- 1000 microseconds; f requency 0.5- 200 Hz; a mplitude [ADDRESS_648294] the externalized ends of the percutaneous electrodes  (model 3086)  
to the Ripple NOMAD will consist of minimizing strain on the connections by [CONTACT_503578]  (model 3386) . The loops will be positioned 
in proximity to the implant site using adhesive tape. Additionally, each connection will be secured using adhesive tape. Finally, each connection and implantation site, as well as the strain relief loops, will be protected us ing an adhe sive bandage.  
 During sessions of rehabilitation with stimulation, the looped lead wires and lead extensions will be connected to Abbott’s battery- powered pulse generator  (model 3599)  via “multilead 
trial cables” (model 3013) . Stimulation waveforms and electrode configurations will be 
transmitted wirelessly from the “clinician programmer” (model 3874) to the battery powered pulse generator. The battery -powered pulse generator, multilead trial cables, and clinician 
programmer are manufactured by [CONTACT_503579].

4.[ADDRESS_648297] Recruitment , Enrollment  and Screening  
A total of 8 s ubjects will undergo the experiments described within this protocol. Subjects 
will be  recruited from the following:  
 
• Mayo Clinic’s volunteer research subject  database  
• Mayo Clinic’s clinical trials website  
• Mayo Clinic’s electronic medical record database search tools  
• ClinicalTrials.gov   
Prior to participating in the screening phase, a member of the research team will provide a detailed explanation of the study and answer questions asked by [CONTACT_503581] . 
If the potential subject  is willing to participate in the study, they will be given sufficient time 
to make an informed decision, review relevant informed consent documents, and ask questions. Once questions and concerns have been addressed to the potential subject’s satisfaction , the informed consent form will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_503582]. A copy of the signed consent documents will be provided to the subject. The original signed consent documents will be retained within study records.  
 Following informed consent, screening tests will be performed including a thorough history and physical examination by a physician and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Pre -existing clinical results 
to screening assessments may be accepted at the investigators’ discretion if the testing was done within the timeframe specified for  each test in the Study Procedures section. The ASIA 
Impairment Scale (AIS) examination will also be completed during screening to determine severity and classification of SCI . Urine tests will b e completed to rule out an active urinary 
tract infection; if the testing is positive for a urinary tract infection, the subject will be

mock -up therapy session utilizing body weight supported harness system over the treadmill 
and trainer assistance to facilitate stand and step activities while monitoring blood pressure, 
tolerance, and range of motion. Due to an absence of standardized clinical practice guidelines that inform rehabilitation task safety decisions, if any concerns related to upright and load 
bearing activities exists, i.e. limited range of motion of load bearing joints, high spasticity, 
low blood pressure, osteoporosis (defined as a DEXA t -score of - 3.5 or lower at the spi[INVESTIGATOR_224380]), or high body weight, participants will receive motor training while seated and/or supi[INVESTIGATOR_503473] a mat table , to avoid injury related to load- bearing activities . Based on screening results, a 
final decision on study participation will be made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749] . If any 
exclusionary screening results are transitory in nature, the subject may be re -screened at the 
discretion of the investigators . Screening tests will be repeated as indicated in the Study 
Procedures section.  
4.[ADDRESS_648298] from the study at any time. 
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Factors that may lead to withdrawal:  
• Study subject  health concerns  
• Protocol violation (e.g., non- compliance)  
• Study- related serious adverse events  
• Study subject ’s decision to pursue activities outside of the study protocol, that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], may compromise data collected within the study protocol  
• The emergence of other problems, events, or information, that may adversely affect 
the rights, safety, or welfare of the study subject , or may substantially compromise 
data collected within the study protocol  
If a serious adverse event occurs during an activity described in this protocol, a consensual 
decision will be made between the study subject  and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503474].  
In the event of study withdrawal, the ES electrodes  will be surgically explanted. If 
explanation surgery is urgent  due to concern for the subject ’s health, the cost of the 
explanation surgery will be covered by [CONTACT_67300]. Aside from standard surgical 
recovery, no adverse effects are anticipated from the removal of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_503475].  
If a subject  is withdrawn from the study for any reason other than treatment -related adverse 
events, an additional subject  may be recruited as a replacement within the same study cohort.  
If a subject  fails to attend protocol activities and fails to respond for follow -up, a 
communication attempt will be made to determine if non -compliance is related to an adverse 
event.  
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.[ADDRESS_648299] stimulator  
(Model 3086, Model 3874, Abbott Neuromodulation; Nomad, Ripple Neuro)  
 
The E S electrode lead is an  implantable neurostimulation device that is  FDA -approved for 
treatment of neuropathic pain disorders. ES leads will be implanted temporarily along the dorsal epi[INVESTIGATOR_503476] (i.e., L2- S1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_158435]). The 
externalized ends of the ES electrode leads will be connected to the Nomad neurostimulation 
system  in order to deliver testing -specific electrical pulse wavef orms to  the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503477] 
(Figure 4). ES pulses will be synchronized to electrophysiological and biomechanical recordings of spi[INVESTIGATOR_503478], and in turn, motor functions that are enabled by [INVESTIGATOR_5165] . 
Electrophysiological data will be collected from skin surface electrodes. Additionally, during ES using the Ripple Nomad, signals will also be captured from passive electrodes (i.e., not configured as an anode or cathode during stimulation) on the ES lead ( Abbott, Model 3086). 
During ES -enabled rehabilitation sessions, when non- testing -specific electrical pulse 
waveforms are applied , the Abbott  clinician programmer device designated for the ES leads 
will be used . 
  
Transcutaneous spi[INVESTIGATOR_55441]  
(DS8R, Digitimer LLC)  
 The DS8R is designed for human research rather than diagnosis or therapy;  it does not have a 
medical device certification.  The DS8R is an isolated, constant current stimulator for human 
research studies involving nerve and muscle stimulation via surface electrodes. It features a high compliance voltage and can be triggered and controlled by [CONTACT_503583]. For the purpose of delivering TS  to the surface of the skin over the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], customized 
electrical waveforms built within Labchart electrophysiological  data acquisition software 
(ADInstruments Inc., Colorado). The DS8R will be triggered  to deliver TS  waveforms via 
Power Lab digital outputs (ADIstruments Inc., Colorado). The DS8R is capable of delivering 
monophasic or biphasic current pulses of up to 2ms duration, with an output range of 2mA to 1000mA* (from 400V). The actual current achieved will be restricted by a pulse e nergy limit 
of 300mJ per pulse and the skin/electrode resistance.

TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.[ADDRESS_648301] volunteers to participate, he/she will be allowed to choose the 
treatment arm in which to enroll.   
5.3 Preparation and Administration /Impl antation  of Investigational D evice 
Description of TS  administration  
A constant- current  stimulator  DS8R  (Digitimer  LLC)  will be used  to deliver  TS to the skin 
surface  over the  spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. At locations where self -adhesive bipolar recording electrodes will be 
placed onto the skin, the area will be cleaned with alcohol to ensure secure attachment and enhance signal recordings. The  stimulation  will be administered  using self -adhesive 
electrodes  placed  as cathodes  on the skin between  the T7  and L3 vertebrae, with  the option of 
ultrasound (US) guided imaging to  locate the spi[INVESTIGATOR_503479] . In addition, 
self-adhesive electrodes  will be placed  symmetrically  on the skin serving as  anodes. A foam  
pad may  be placed  over the cathode and secured  using adhesive tape and/or an  elastic  belt to 
tightly  wrap  around the subject’s  trunk to  ensure cathode electrodes  do not shift or peel  away  
during rehabilitation  activities.  The stimulation  waveform  will consist or bi -phasic pulses 
(duration between  0.1 – 1.0 ms),  at frequencies  between  0.2 –100Hz. We  will also  test the 
efficacy  of a recently  developed  carrier  frequency  of 4 – 10 kHz,  using stimulation  intensities  
of up to  100 mA.  Skin under the electr odes will be inspected  frequently during sessions to  
ensure no irritation  occurs from  stimulation.  
 
Description of ES system implantation/administration  
We recently published a detailed explanation of the procedure to implant a permanent 
electrode array connected to an implanted pulse generator, along with a detailed description of the electrophysiological approach used to guide electrode positioning over the lumbosacral enlargement in humans with SCI (Calvert, 2018). The same approach will be used during this study to guide electrode placement via electrophysiological monitoring of spi[INVESTIGATOR_503480].   The procedures for percutaneously implanting Abbott ES electrodes are performed daily at Mayo Clinic to treat patients suffering from neuropathic pain. Prior to implantation, subjects will undergo a pre-operative evaluation to minimize the risk of unexpected complications. Pre-operative assessments may be performed to check for any signs of infection.  
 In order to implant the temporary spi[INVESTIGATOR_503481], an incision will be made at the entry site to the depth of the subcutaneous fascia. Under fluoroscopy, an electrode insertion needle will be place into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503482] a paramedial approach unti l resistance is felt from the 
ligamentum flavum, followed by [CONTACT_503584]’s position. Once positioning is confirmed, the needle stylet will be removed and the needle will be advanced into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].
  
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.7

Kristin D. Zhao, Ph.D.   CONFIDENTIAL   
 
Then, the leads are advanced in an anterograde fashion to deliver them into the intervertebral foramen under fluoroscopic guidance. Following electrophysiologic confirmation of electrode positioning, the needle and stylet will be removed, the implantation site will be dressed, and the leads will be secured to the skin via an adhesive bandage. The implantation site will be monitored for signs of infection, tissue erosion, or dislodged lead wires.  
Procedure to explant ES electrode leads  
 After completing 12 sessions of rehabilitation with ES , the adhesive bandage covering the 
implantation site will be removed, the incision site will be opened, and the leads will be carefully retracted. Finally, the incision site will be cleaned and dressed.  
 If complications associated with temporary lead implantation (e.g., infection, severe lead migration, device malfunction, etc.) are observed, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503483] [ADDRESS_648302]’s prior therapy regimen will not impact the PI’s decision regarding enrollment into 
the study. As long as the subject fits the inclusion criteria and does not demonstrate any exclusion criteria characteristics ( i.e., bone fractures, joint contractures, or skin lesions), prior 
exercise or therapy programs will not exclude their participation in the study. While enrolled 
in the study, subject s will be asked to follow the instructions from the study staff regarding 
the home exercise program prescribed from the research team. For example, if the study 
subject  performed locomotor training at a local gym prior to the study, they would be asked 
to discontinue that activity while participating in the trial.    
5.6 Packaging and Labeling  
The packaging of the devices will be from the manufacturer’s  clinical supply. The following 
will be added to the devices used within this investigation:

Biomechanical assessments  
During a variety of tasks including supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], side -lying, reaching, standing, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_225077], kinematics, EMG, and foot pressure measurements may be obtained, with or without 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_503439], using the following metrics: 
 
Kinematics: We will use commercially available  markers placed on the skin surface via a 
non-irritant adhesive to record limb movement and joint angles. Available systems we 
may use include video- based, inertial measurement units, electromagnetic.  
 
Electromyography: We will collect muscle activity using skin surface electrodes placed 
at anatomical locations of muscle groups below the level of injury. Activity will be recorded using a 16-channel signal amplifier and data acquisition system (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Colorado). At locations where self -adhesive bipolar recording electrodes 
will be placed onto the skin, the area will be cleaned with alcohol to ensure secure attachment and enhance signal recordings. A subset of the following muscles or muscle groups will be tested: soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, hamstrings, quadriceps, hip adductors, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, abdominals, triceps, trapezius,  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_503496].  
 
Foot pressure: Foot pressure will be measured with shoe-insole pressure sensors (F-
SCAN, Tekscan  Inc., [LOCATION_011], MA ). 
 
Seated pressure: Seated pressure will be assessed via a force sensing array placed beneath 
the buttocks ( Vista Medical BodiTrak force sensing array, Winnipeg, MB, Canada ). 
 Over the course of rehabilitation, if the research team observes stimulation -enabled functions 
that could be enhanced by [CONTACT_503586], biomechanical  assessment equipment may be used during select rehabilitation sessions in addition to the main assessment timepoints described in T able 3.

Kristin D. Zhao, Ph.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  Electrophysiology tests  
Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs): SSEPs will be recorded through surface 
electrodes to measure conduction in the peripheral nerves, cervical and lumbosacral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], deep brain structures, and sensory cortex. Skin will be cleaned with alcohol and prepared using mild abrasive tape for placement of surface electrodes. For tibial recordings the tibial nerve will be stimulated behind the medial malleolus with recordings on the scalp utilizing a Fz,-CZ montage (International 10- 20 System for EEG electrode 
placement), the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (C5  reference to Fz), the L1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (referenced to iliac 
crest), and the popliteal region. For median SSEPs, the median nerve will be stimulated at the wrist with recording electrodes at the scalp (C3 -C4), the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (C5- Fz), Erb ’s 
point (referenced to contralateral Erb ’s) and the elbow. Repeated single- pulse electrical 
stimulation will be delivered at intensities of 1 -1.5 times motor threshold for visual twitch 
for each of the four nerves evaluated. Averaged responses for up to 256 stimuli will be recorded for each of these two intensities for the right and left median and tibial nerves. 
Simultaneous bilateral stimulation will be applied if no recognizable responses are recorded from the scalp leads. Stimulation delivery rates will not exceed 2 per seco nd. 
Recorded data will include amplitudes, peak latencies and interpeak latencies . Existing 
SSEPs within 6 months of screening may be acceptable for Baseline results at the investigators’ discretion. 
 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Motor evoked potentials (MEP): TMS MEPs 
will be evoked by [CONTACT_1299] a magnetic coil over the vertex of the head to elicit MEP. Upper limb MEPs will be recorded from the deltoid, triceps brachii, flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_503498]. The “threshold” TMS intensity will be defined as the minimum stimulus intensity required to elicit a response, recorded from muscles above the injury, that appears in response to >50% of the stimuli pulses delivered. If no MEPs are observed in EMG recordings from muscles that are innervated by [CONTACT_96945][INVESTIGATOR_503499], but are present in muscles innervated by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_503500], then the injury severity will be deemed functionally motor complete. Data will be digitized,  and MEPs 
responses averaged for each muscle. Latencies (interval from stimulus artifact to onset of response) and peak- to-peak amplitudes of MEPs responses will be assessed f rom all 
muscles . Existing TMS-MEPs within 6 months of screening may be acceptable for 
Baseline results at the investigators’ discretion.  
 
TMS Pulses Paired to TS or ES Pulses 
In order to interrogate the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_503501]/or ES through the injury site in participants with SCI, we will apply pulses of TMS at time intervals ranging from 5 -
100ms prior to activation of lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_503502]. Evidence suggests both TS and ES, applied over the thoracolumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], activate dorsal roots to elicit a motor reflex root-evoked potential. At each assessment time point, we will incrementally increase TS or ES pulse amplitudes to identify the stimulus intensity that consistently generates spi[INVESTIGATOR_503503]. Then, two TS or ES pulses will be delivered 50 ms apart to characterize the trans -
synaptic nature of the reflex which will be determined by [CONTACT_503587] a 
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.7 
 
Page 28 of 46 
Kristin D. Zhao, Ph.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  response to the second stimulus pulse (i.e., post activation depression). Next, we will 
examine the conditioning effect (e.g., no change, increased amplitude of reflex, or decreased amplitude of reflex) of delivering TMS pulses at time intervals ranging from 5-100ms prior to pulses of TS or ES while recording spi[INVESTIGATOR_503504].  
 
TS MEPs  
To assess the functional states of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_503448], we will deliver transcutaneous spi[INVESTIGATOR_503505] [ADDRESS_648307] evoked potentials while relaxed using stimulus intensities from 1-100 mA at increments of 10 mA for each stimulus location. Evoked potentials for each stimulus location and intensity will be averaged and visualized in real- time to determine the 
optimal location for evoking threshold potentials across all recorded musc les. Stimulus 
intensities that are at the threshold for evoking motor potentials will be delivered: while attempting prolonged maximal contractions of all muscles; during attempts to contract the left leg; and during attempts to contract the right leg. Evoked potentials will be analyzed according to task, stimulus intensity, and stimulus location.   
ES MEPs  
To assess the  effects of delivering ES pulses to various regions of the lumbosacral spi [INVESTIGATOR_36232], we will record skin surface EMG from lower extremity muscles while ES is delivered to the temporarily implanted electrodes using a subset of anode/cathode configurations. Electrode configurations will be selected in order to  selectively stimulate 
the rostral or caudal regions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_503506] T11-L1 vertebral bodies. This region of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_503507]/right lower extremities. ES pulses will be  delivered as biphasic charge- balanced 
rectangular pulses ranging in pulse width (0. 05-1ms), amplitude (0-25.5mA), and 
frequency ( 0.5-200  Hz). Within the implanted lead, each electrode could be configured

specific rostral -caudal and medial -lateral regions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_503508].  
 Overground mobility For subjects with motor incomplete injuries, attempts to stand and generate steps with varying degrees of body-weight support will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go (TUG), Berg Balance Score (BBS) while using the [ADDRESS_648308] (6MWT) to assess endurance changes. Measurements made as part of intake for the SCI Service Line may be used, if available.  
 
TS or ES in SCI        Version 1.[ADDRESS_648309] (mFRT)  for subjects unable to stand. The

ankles position at [ADDRESS_648310] can reach before trunk balance becomes 
unstable (requiring assistance to regain balance from the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) is measured for multiple reaching trials.  
 During the trunk stability assessment, skin surface EMG will be collected bilaterally from lower extremity and trunk muscles, as well as the trapezius. Pressure recordings will also be collected from under both feet  and under the buttocks .  
 Subjects capable of standing will undergo assessment via Berg Balance Assessment , the 
standing version of the Functional Reach Test (FRT) , and the modified functional reach test 
(mFRT) . 
 International Standards of Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI)  
We will conduct ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) to assess severity of the injury. This test focuses mainly on sensory and motor functions. Measurements made as part of intake for the SCI Service Line may be used, if available.

visualize the location of implanted leads. This x- ray will be performed if stimulation -enabled 
motor activity is remarkably inconsistent from session to session , which might  indicate 
migration of the ES lead(s). 
 
Bladder function  
A urodynamic test consisting of a filling phase and a voiding phase cystometrogram along with perineal patch muscle electromyography (EMG) will be performed with the stimulator both on and off. Specifically, a 9F double -lumen catheter will be introduced tr ansurethrally into the 
bladder. One lumen of this catheter will be used for bladder filling at an average flow rate of 20-25 ml/min (according to ICS guidelines), and another will record intravesical pressure. 
Intra -abdominal pressure will be recorded by a  12F rectal catheter. Through multichannel 
pressure transduction, intravesical and intra -abdominal pressures will be simultaneously

Each month, as well as upon receipt of new or repaired devices, and at the completion of the 
study, there will be a reconciliation of devices shipped, devices utilized, and devices remaining. This reconciliation will be logged, signed, and dated within the Device Accountability Form. Any discrepancies noted will be documented and an investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the discrepancy.    
8 STATISTICAL DESIGN AND POWER  
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_503515], no formal power calculations were performed for this study. The number of subjects was selected based on budgetary, space, and personnel time constraints. Eight subjects will be enrolled to complete  the activities of this clinical trial, 
depending on need for contingency subjects. All subjects will receive either 1 month of TS and rehabilitation or 1 month of ES and rehabilitation. Following either intervention, all subjects will be followed for follow -up assessments at 2 time points during 4 additional 
months. 
8.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive Statistics and Graphics  
Continuous data will be summarized as median (inner quartile range). Categorical data will be presented as frequency (percentage). Graphical presentations of data will be used for all endpoints. Individual data points will be plotted over time, with distinctions made between data from TS and ES groups. Additionally, associations between measurements prior to and following ES intervention will be assessed using bivariate scatterplots. These associations will be summarized numerically with Spearman’s correlation coefficient.  
 Modeling  
The overall ES effect will be assessed by [CONTACT_503592]. Additionally, measurements taken under various conditions can be modeled simultaneously with appropriate effects for the different conditions. For example , SSEPs will 
be measured at the tibial and median nerves, each at [ADDRESS_648314] Population(s) for Analysis  
All-completed population: Only subjects who completed all study rela ted procedures and 
follow -up will be included; however, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503516] a subject who 
completed the majority of the study visits and procedures.  
 
[ADDRESS_648315] (UADE) will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. Records of these events will be maintained,  and reports will be submitted to the 
FDA and IRB according to the regulatory requirements. Expected clinical AEs and 
nonsignificant (not serious) clinical AEs  will not be reported.  
 9.1 Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE)  
A UADE is any SAE that impact s the health or safety,  or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device if that event, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that rel ates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
participants.  
 9.2 Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence of an investigational device; regardless of the causal relationship of the problem with the device or, if applicable, other study related treatment(s). The following categorization of AEs will be used:  
 9.2.[ADDRESS_648316] caused death.  
 9.2.3 Serious AE  
An AE will be considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes:   
• death

Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1)  death; (2) life 
threatening AE ; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] -  inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity -  
persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other

product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data.  
 9.7.2 Unanticipated  
Events that are not already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the PI’s brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND

 9.[ADDRESS_648319] with the participant, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503518]. Study participants will be routinely questioned about AE at study visits. Information on all AE will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate AE s ection of the case report 
form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results will be recorded in the source document.  All observed or volunteered AEs (serious and non -serious) and abnormal test findings, 
regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational device, will be recorded in the participant’s case history. For all AEs, sufficient information will be pursued and or obtained as to permit; an adequate determination of the outcome, an assessment of the casual relationship between the AE and the investigational device or, if applicable other study treatment or diagnostic product. The cl inical course of each event will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause. Serious AEs that are unresolved at the end of the study period wil l be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious 
AE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  9.[ADDRESS_648320] findings

• The abnormal test finding will be classified as an AE  
• There is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_503593]  
• The AE meets the criteria of serious AE  
 If the PI’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the investigational device or other study treatments,” the AE will be classified as associated with the use of the investigational device or other study treatments for reporting purposes. If the PI’s final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the investigational device or other study treatments,”  this determination and the rationale for the determination 
will be documented in the respective part icipant’s case history.

Version 11/8/2011 
MEDAMACS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_727578] 
11/08/[ADDRESS_993774] extended survival and improved 
quality in advanced heart failure patients awaiting cardiac transplantation and in inotrope-dependent 
patients who are ineligible for transplant.2-4  The INTERMACS Registry (Interagency Registry of 
Mecha
nical Assist Circulatory Support) has facilitated the refinement of patient selection for thi s 
therapy by [CONTACT_727617]5, [ADDRESS_993775] years of INTERMACS were dominated by [CONTACT_727618] 1-2 with 
medical survival of hours to weeks, comparison to outcomes for ambulatory patients without 
devices was initially of limited relevance. However, the lack of information on outcomes with 
continued medical therapy has limited the ability to define and advance indications in the “less 
sick” despi[INVESTIGATOR_727579]-documented progress that should attract ambulatory patients, who 
curre
ntly make up fewer than 20% of all patients receiving mechanical support.6  (Figure 1) 
The deve
lopment of a contemporary parallel population of ambulatory patients with heart 
failure is necessary in order to meet the commitment defined for INTERMACS at its inception in 
2005 and re-emphasized for the renewal beginning 2010, for INTERMACS to 1). Facilitate the 
refinement of
 patient selection to maximize outcomes with current devices within approved 
indications, and to 2). Guide and expedite clinical trials for new indications and/or new devices.   
This is true both for survival outcomes and for outcomes beyond survival, measured in terms of 
quality of life, functional capacity, and satisfaction with the chosen strategy of care.  
The future impact of mechanical circulatory support on public health will be experienced by 
[CONTACT_727619]-term benefit 
with diminishing operative risk.  At present, the si ze and clinical characteristics of the population 
with a
dvanced ambulatory heart failure despi[INVESTIGATOR_727580]
h patients have been enrolled in clinical trials.  Patients with less severe 
heart f
ailure can clearly identify thresholds for consideration of a ventric ular assist device, or 
VAD.7 A better understanding of this population and their unique priorities is vital in order to 
antic
ipate the optimal expansion of mechanical circulatory support in to the less critically ill 
population. 
These
 needs will be addressed in the Medical Arm for Mechanically Assisted Circulator y 
Support (MedaMACS) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116].  MedaMACS will characterize the types of patients who are not 
rece
iving an LVAD currently due to the intersection of relative contra-indications, to their own 
preferences, or to their characterization as “less sick” either by [CONTACT_727620].  The nature of contemporary “optimal” medical therapy 
will be reported, and the major risk scores for heart failure will be calculated and challenged.  
MedaMACS will incorporate specific consideration of frailty as measured by [CONTACT_727621], the 
proposed new “geriatric vital sign”.  In relation to the characteristics at baseline and over time, 
MedaMACS will provide information on medical outcomes in terms of timed endpoints of VAD, 
transpla
nt, or death.  There will also be determination of adverse events of stroke and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727581].  Of equal weight will be the 
determi
nation of functional capacity, quality of life, and satisfaction with therapy.  For many 
ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure, the magnitude and predictability of expected 
improvement
 in functional status with a VAD will li kely influence their VAD decisions more than 
the margin of survival benefit. These are pi[INVESTIGATOR_727582]-making for advanced heart 
MEDAMACS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_727578] 
11/08/[ADDRESS_993776] benefit of 
mechanical support is anticipated.    
Since INTERMACS was originally conceived, penetration of this technology has advanced 
steadily but increasingly requires expanded expertise and commitment beyond the original 
investiga
tors.  The presence and influence of a vital young academic cardiology cadre will be 
crucial to maintain skill and focus on clinical application during rapid evolution of mechanical 
support technology.  MedaMACS has been designed to meet the scientific goals required for 
progress whil
e fostering the development of a core group of emerging heart failure cardiology 
investigators at key sites.  This group will provide leadership in the identification and follow-up of 
the cascading sequence of changing populations for mechanical support.   
 
 
2.  S
PECIFIC AIMS 
  
Aim 1: To identify prospectively a population of ambulatory patients followed on optimal 
medical therapy for whom chronic heart failure limits both function and survival to a range 
where elective implantation of left ventricular assist devices should offer meaningful benefit.   
Hypothesis:  It will be possible to define baseline characteristics that predict a one year mortality 
of ≥35±5% for patients on medical therapy and ≤25±5% in patients who have had VAD.   
 
1.[ADDRESS_993777] in technical 
interve
ntion. There will be two baseline measurements one month a part (used to predict 
earl
y stability) and a repeated set at 1 year (used to predict outcome between 1 and 2 
yea
rs). These outcomes will includ e: a). All clinical parameters required for current risk 
score models a
nd prediction, b). Follow-up values and changes from baseline to [ADDRESS_993778] outcomes on medical 
therapy, c) . Functional capacity, quality of life, and patient preferences at baseline and 
after tim
e. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_993779] outcomes for ambulatory patients with advanced heart failure for comparison to 
VAD, to inc
lude a). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], VAD, transplant, survival without VAD or 
transplant, b). Major adverse events leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], including infection, 
neurologi
c or bleeding, c ). Functional capacity and quality of life, d). Eligibility for 
transpla
nt, e). Changes in resuscitation status and enrollment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. 
 
Aim 2:  To design an integrated endpoint of survival and objective functional assessment that 
provides more discrimination between chronic ambulatory heart failure and current device 
outcomes than survival alone.  
Hypothesis: It will be possible to identify a composite endpoint of survival and function that will 
show a 30% difference between outcomes on medical therapy and outcome with initial VAD.

2.1 Compare survival and functional outcomes for MedaMACS patients and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_727583].   Within each Profile 4-7, comparisons will be made for a). Clinical 
chara
cteristics, b). Outcomes, and c) . Outcomes for populations from INTERMACS and 
MedaMACS
 defined by [CONTACT_727622].   
 
2.2 De
fine changes in 6 minute walk between baselines and 12 and 24 months after 
enrollme
nt, to determine timing, frequency and degree of improvement for Profiles 4-7 
after 
entry for medical therapy, and compare to INTERMACS results.  
 
2.3 Define changes in quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_727623]-5D and Kansas City 
Cardiom
yopathy Questionnaire.  
 
2.4 Analyze distribution of integrated functional survival endpoints to a). Inform individual 
patie
nt decisions between VAD and medical therapy, b). Provide basis of evidence Level 
B for 
VAD guidelines, and c). Estimate sample sizes for pi[INVESTIGATOR_727584].  
 
Aim 3:  To evaluate patient perceptions about their cardiac condition, ventricular assist 
device technology, preferences for their care, and thresholds for considering device implant.  
Hypothesis: The likelihood of patients expressing preference for a VAD will increase with their 
functional limitation and with their predicted risk of 1 year mortality. 
 
3.1 Patient functional capacity by [CONTACT_727624] 6 minute walk will be assessed twice at 
base
line and again at 1 year and 2 years. These will be compared to their expressed 
willingne
ss to consider VAD at their own level of function and from a series of 
hypothetic
ally worse states. 
 
3.2 Available relevant mortality prediction models will be used to estimate 1 year survival 
from base
line and from the one-year re-evaluation.  These will be compared to patients’ 
expressed willingness to consider VAD at their own anticipated level of survival and from 
a serie
s of hypothetically worse states.  
 
Aim 4:  To develop and advance a team of emerging clinical investigators who will increase 
awareness of mechanical circulatory support and serve as role models for other young 
investigators.    
Hypothesis: Focused mentorship of early career investigators will foster the next generation of 
leaders in the clinical care of patients with advanced heart disease. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_993780] so there is synergy across centers and 
appropriate extramural mentorship is available.   
 
4.3 Survey will be made among the young investigators for VAD-re lated publications, 
progression to independent research status, and affiliation to clinical VAD programs at 5 
years after initiation of MedaMACS enrollment.

3.  BACKGROUND - Gaps in Current Medical Trial Data 
 
Survival Prediction 
The available information from the randomized trials of REMATCH, INTREPID, and the 
combined experiences of other inotrope-dependent patients provides a boundary of approximately 
75% one-year mortality on medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].2,8  On the other side are the experiences in 
ambulatory outpatients with advanced heart failure, in which one-year mortality is no more than 
20% in trial of beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and cardiac resynchronization. These medical 
trial populations thus cannot be aligned with experiences with approved VADs, in whom the one-
year mortality was in the range of 30% as reported specifically in the HeartMate II device trial.[ADDRESS_993781] 20% in INTERMACS when outcomes are isolated for LVAD without right 
ventricular
 support.[ADDRESS_993782] unaddressed the wide chasm of one year 
medical m
ortality between 25 and 75%, within which falls the largest anticipated target population 
of ambulatory patients for current implantable VADs.  
This chasm cannot be crossed by [CONTACT_727625]-year mortality of 30-50%, but an average age is 75.9,10  with prevalence of co-morbidities such 
as chr
onic pulmonary disease and peripheral vascular disease in the range of 30%, with dementia, 
stroke, cancer each in the range of 10-20%.[ADDRESS_993783] a young population with one-year survival rates in the range of 80-90%. In the pyramid 
of risk for de
ath during heart failure, the largest level is the bed of risk at the base, in which the 
patient remains regardless of therapy received, with such risks as intrinsic liver and lung disease, 
and the intermediate levels where malnutrition and renal dysfunction compromise peri-operative 
outcomes and offer uncertain potential for improvement. (Figure 2)  Potential for benefit is reflected 
best at the top of the pyramid with risk factors such as hemodynamics and biomarkers that are 
addressed directly by [CONTACT_727626] (or transplant).  The robust Seattle Heart Failure Score versions, derived 
from dispa
rate trial populations, have been used to identify very low risk patients and patients with 
heart failure severity unlikely to benefit from ICD therapy.[ADDRESS_993784] this spectrum of patients has been 
shown in analysis of the first140 patients of the MedaMACS screening pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. (Figure 3) 
 
Fun
ctional Capacity Prediction  
 As we look toward the “less sick” populations, it has been shown that patient interest in 
VAD is heavily influenced by [CONTACT_727627]. The increasing focus on shared 
decision-making in advanced heart failure requires that patients be given adequate information to 
choose among available options.  This requires better understanding of the expected functional 
outcome on medical therapy as well as with VADs.  Current reports of those patients providing 
serial i
nformation on quality of life through Kansas City questionnaires indicate improvement in the 
rang
e of [ADDRESS_993785] ambulatory 
MEDAMACS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_727578] 
11/08/2011 
   
 
 
 
 7 heart failure.14  Similarly, 6 minute walk distances show major improvement but the majority of 
patients were unable to perform them at baseline.14  Contemporary information about the trajectory 
of quali
ty of life and functional capacity over 12-24 months for patients ambulatory at baseline will 
be crucial to understanding and communicating expected benefits from VAD.  
 
Benefit Emphasized Over Risk  
MedaMACS outcomes will accelerate the progress of mechanical circulatory support into 
the ambulatory population.  Outcomes will include the rate of progression to transplant or VAD 
after enrollment for 2 years.  For those patients remaining alive on medical therapy, information 
will include key adverse events and functional capacity in detail for one year and general life 
satisfaction at one and 2 years.  Taken in conjunction with INTERMACS data, the MedaMACS 
baseli
ne and outcome data will facilitate the important evolution from risk scores to “ Benefit 
Scores”, which reflect both the anticipated risk without MCS and the likelihood of good outcomes 
with MCS. This will be used both for overall survival, survival without major events, and adjusted 
scores that i
nclude quality of life and functional capacity in survivors. 
   
 
4.  PRELIMINARY DATA 
 
INTERMACS Provides the Framework  
 INTERMACS has established the key questions in the potential VAD populations along 
with the data field framework upon which to answer them for ambulatory patients on medical 
therap
y.  INTERMACS has validated clinical patient profiles and has established new branch points 
for dec
isions regarding transplant.15  Outcome fields for specific adverse events, re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
cardia
c function, systemic markers of disease, and functional capacity are designed to capture not 
only endpoints but the crucial midpoints that allow an integration of function and survival over 
time.  The architecture for INTERMACS has been designed from its inception to favor entry of 
parallel information for patients receiving contemporary medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   The experience from 
INTERMAC
S will illuminate the establishment of MedaMACS.

outlined below, 168 patients with advanced ambulatory systolic heart failure and recurrent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727587] 7 months.  Comprehensive baseline data of usual care practices 
was rec

Eligibility for enrollment will be based only upon information that is clinically available at the time 
of screening.  The history of prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727589].  Routine 
evaluation and triage of ambulatory patients with advanced heart disease includes echocardiography 
and functional assessment with peak oxygen consumption and frequently 6 minute walk distance, 
The elements of information required for estimation of the Seattle Heart Failure Risk score will be 
gleaned from laboratory data, or imputed as described in the Seattle score literature. The research 
coordinator will enter this data onto a currently available website for calculation of the Seattle 
score.  
 Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_378097]. The 
inclusion crite
ria will be checked individually for “all that apply, with numeric values where 
indicated.  The exclusion criteria will be verified by [CONTACT_727630]. After determination of 
elig
ibility, a member of the study research team will approach individual subjects who are potential 
candidates for participation and for whom the subject’s primary physician has given permission to 
approach.  No group of persons will be excluded without a good scientific or ethical reason to do so.  
Incarcerated prisoners have been excluded by [CONTACT_3181].  For patients who meet inclusion 
criteria but who have an exclusion criteria related to non-cardiac conditions (Exclusion Criterion #2, 
#3, or #9) and for eligible patients not providing informed consent, a screening log will be kept that 
includes their age, ejection fraction, race and gender.  This basic information is necessary to assess 
comple
teness of patient capture and possible bias in the screening process and in the process to 
obtain informed consent.  No further information will be collected on patients who do not meet the 
inclusion criteria.  This screening log will help determine the total number of advanced ambulatory 
heart failure patients eligible for MedaMACS participation at each study center.

clinically indicated.  In those centers selected for MedaMACS, as in most centers with high volume 
advanced heart disease evaluation, peak VO2 and echocardiographic assessment are routine 
components of regular and serial evaluation.   Medications, cardiac imaging, and exercise testing 
will occ

 13 Actuarial survival curves will be generated and compared to known risk models, such as the Seattle 
Heart Failure Score and the Heart Failure Survival Score, for both heart failure populations and 
VAD populations from INTERMACS.19, 20  In addition, new models will be developed to allow 
comparison of anticipated outcomes after VADs using INTERMACS data.  It is fully recognized 
that these comparisons will be inevitably limited through confounding by [CONTACT_35151].  The intent is 
to identify a range of baseline profiles for which anticipated outcome with medical survival can be 
projected.  From this information, hypotheses can be generated for target populations in whom 
VAD therapy might be expected to yield better outcomes.  
 
 “Primary” Endpoint and Power 
As this is a registry designed to determine outcomes for particular groups of patients, there 
will be more
 than one “primary” endpoint depending on the level of severity of illness.  Knowing 
that survival in isolated VAD patients dominated by [CONTACT_727636] I and II has reached 70% at one year,  it 
is reasonable to assume that survival will be at least as good or better with VAD in less sick 
patients.  We hypothesize that it will be possible to define baseline characteristics that predict a one 
yea
r mortality of > 35 + 5% for patients on medical therapy and < 25 + 5% in patients who have 
had VAD.  Seeking a confidence interval of approximately + 5%, this could be accomplished 
initially with approximately [ADDRESS_993799] other events ending their medical 
history, such as transplant and deterioration to worse INTERMACS profiles for which they receive 
VADs.   
For groups within which survival is > 60% at [ADDRESS_993800] important for comparison to VAD therapy.  We hypothesize 
that it will be possible to identify a composite endpoint of survival and function that will show a 
30% difference between outcomes on medical therapy and outcome with initial VAD.  The nature 
of these survival-function endpoints will be explored during the first year of MEDAMACS data.  
The two simplest will be done with the endpoints of days alive out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and quality-adjusted 
life 
years according to the Euroqol.  However, more complex endpoints will be tested for survival 
and func
tional scores at specific intervals.  (Figure 5) 
Information will be collected regarding the major adverse events that lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727595], as listed in the data appendix: neurologic 
event, non-CNS bleeding, sepsis, ventricular tachyarrhythmia or ICD firing. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
adverse events and deaths will be attributed on site by [CONTACT_727637]-down menus.  There 
will be no independent adjudication of causes of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413337].  The general categories 
of causality are broad and not the focus of the primary hypotheses. Thus, the lack of formal 
adjudication should not compromise the data for the endpoints of death, transplant, and VAD, 
which are
 objectively determined.  The secondary endpoints that relate to functional capacity and to 
quality of life will also be specifically determined.  
 
Statistical M
ethods 
Baseline data between different patient groups will be compared using student’s t-test for 
normally distributed continuous variables and Wilcoxon Rank Sum for non-normally continuous 
variables.  Kaplan-Meier curves will be constructed for time to death, VAD or transplant for the 
two-y
ear study period.  Event rates including cause-specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727596].  Analysis plans for specific research questions will be 
developed unde

9. MATURATION OF MEDAMACS 
 
 The launc
hing of MedaMACS will focus on the ambulatory population closely proximal to 
the common thre
shold for implementation of mechanical circulatory support.  The foundation of the 
10 site
s entering patients for the MedaMACS screening pi[INVESTIGATOR_727598], with t
he additional 2 sites.  The fastidious definition of entry criteria offers a fine- tuning 
knob to dia
l up or down disease acuity of patients enrolled, as this becomes necessary.   However, 
the gener
al approach to baseline data collection, risk profiling, assessment of adverse events and 
outcomes, is planned for cascading applications to progressi vely “more well” populations to keep 
pace with those enrolling into INTERMACS.   The next promising target population will be the 
population of patients waiting at home after listing for transplant.  As the improving outcomes of 
implantable V
ADs are demonstrated by [CONTACT_727640] a bridge to transplant, 
past e
ven the current focus on the transplant-ineligible population, MedaMACS will prepare the 
field on whic
h mechanical circulatory support will finally compete with cardiac transplantation as 
primary therapy to improve quality life for a substantial proportion of the patients currently 
sufferin
g from advanced heart failure.

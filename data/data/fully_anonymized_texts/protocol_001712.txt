2. IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE 
Masimo Corporation is the developer of noninvasive technologies for the measurement and monitoring of physiological variables, 
such as arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), total hemoglobin concentration (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin concentration (SpCO), 
methemoglobin concentration (SpMet), and other physiological variables to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care.  
The Masimo Rad-G with Temperature device (see Figure 1) is a non-contact [CONTACT_329821]. Non-contact [CONTACT_329822]. The sensor then converts radi ant energy to an electrical signal and provides a temperature 
reading without discomfort for the patient or associated hygiene concerns. Thus, non-contact [CONTACT_329823] a particularly 
attractive solution due to its optimization of patient comfort, noninvasiveness, and minimization of cross contamination. The 
device is a non-invasive, non-contact, handheld pulse oximetry device with a rechargeable battery and LCD display. It uses Masimo Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ SET® pulse oximetry technology to measure SpO2, respi[INVESTIGATOR_329809] (RRp™), pulse rate (PR), perfusion index (PI), and temperature. The Masimo Rad-G is not FDA cleared and is 
considered investigational. Though the Rad-G may be used to measure the aforementioned parameters, the Rad-G used in this 
study will only be used to measure body temperature.

to potentially help other patients in the future. Other possible benefits would be to society as a whole.   
4.2. Risks/Discomforts Associated with Participation in the Clinical Investigation 
The Rad-G with Temperature device does not pose risks to the par ticipant, because the device is non-contact [CONTACT_329824]. Reference measurements will be obtained using a su blingual thermometer or a temporal artery thermometer using 
normal practice. 
The other main risk associated with the study is a potential breach of confidentiality which will be minimized by [CONTACT_329825] (PHI) and through secu re data storage practices. None of our measures are diagnostic  in 
nature. There is no other foreseeable risk associated with this study.

6. DESIGN OF THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION 
6.1. General 
This is a prospective, nonrandomized, single arm study. Temperature data will be obtained using the Masimo Rad-G with 
Temperature while obtaining sublingual or temporal artery temperatures as a reference. 
There will be up to 250 participants enrolled into this study, divided into two groups: calibration and validation. There will be no 
difference in the procedures between the two groups. The first group for the calibration phase will be used to gather data for 
product development purposes.  The second group will be the validation set that will be used to evaluate study objectives.   
For the data collection and calibration phase of the study, there are no study endpoints. For the validation phase of the study , 
accuracy of temperature measurements using the Masimo Rad-G with  Temperature will be compared to the reference sublingual 
or temporal artery measurements. 
The validation of the accuracy of the temperature measurement in  the investigational device may be determined using data 
collected from this study, in addition to data from other Masimo sponsored studies.

6.5. Procedures 
6.5.1.  Recruitment and Pre-Screening 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_329812]/or review EMR 
current vital signs records for febrile participants in the emergency department. Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion cri teria 
will be enrolled in the study. 
6.5.2.  Consenting and Screening 
Per FDA Guidance “IRB Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent for Clinical Investigations Involving No More than Minimal 
Risk to Human Subjects” issued on January 2017, waiver of documentation of informed consent for certain FDA-regulated minimal risk clinical investigations will facilitate investigators’ ability to conduct studies that may contribute substantiall y to the 
development of products to diagnose or treat diseases or conditions, or address unmet medical needs. The IRB can waive the 
requirements to document informed consent when the IRB finds that: 
x The clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk (as defined in 21 CFR 50.3(k) or 56.102(i)) to the subjects;  
x The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; 
x The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration;  
x Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation 
This study meets all the criteria listed by [CONTACT_329826] 
(1) the device under study is non-contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238] (2) the clinical data to be obtained includes data collected for routine clinical  use. 
The waiver is not expected to adversely affect the rights and welfare of the study participants because the study involves no-t ouch 
procedures and all data to be collected will be protected as outlined in the data collection and storage procedures. The clinic al 
investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver due to the timing of the clinical assessment and immediat e 
treatment of febrile conditions with antipyretics for children and adolescents in the Emergency Department.   
After a caregiver/patient or their parent/LAR checks into the Em ergency Department, a nurse or trained study investigator will 
approach them, and ask if they would like to participate in a short study looking at fever. If the patient or their parent/LAR is 
interested, an informational sheet outlining the study will be provided to them. This Study Information Sheet will be available  in 
English and Spanish, the two most common languages in Orange County, [LOCATION_004]. The information sheet will be provided prior 
to the start of the study to inform the patient and/or their parent/LAR about the study and what data will be collected. Conten t on 
the information sheet will include: (1) research purpose and pr ocedures, (2) risks, (3) benefits, (4) confidentiality, (5) whom  (and 
how) to contact [CONTACT_3462], (6) the voluntary nature of hu man research and the ability to withdraw participation, and (7) 
reporting of significant new findings. If the participant or their parent/LAR verbally agrees, they will be considered enrolled  in the 
study. Verbal consent from the study investigator will be coll ected after review of the information sheet. Reasonable and 
appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality is no gr eater 
than minimal.  After having the opportunity to review the information sheet, study participants or their parent/LAR will have t he 
opportunity to decline participation in the study
.  After participants have verbally consented, they will be entered into the study 
system and study procedures outlined in the protocol will proceed. 
HIPAA Waiver for Participant Screening 
The screening of participants will require the investigators to  access personal health information to identify prospective 
participants without HIPAA authorization. The participants’ rights and welfare will not be adversely affected by [CONTACT_329827]. This protected health information will not be inappropriately reused or disclosed to any other person or entity.  To 
further safeguard all protected health information, the data will not be labeled with any personal identifying information. Als o, the 
data will not be stored with any protected health information identifiers. 
6.5.3.  Data Collection Procedure 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Data collected by [CONTACT_329828]-G with Temperature is not intended to be used for clinical decisions, and research personnel 
should continue to use standard of care procedures for monitoring participants.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Study duration will be approximately 15 to 30 minutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Record patient demographic information such as, but not only limited to, age, gender, weight, height, Massey scale, race 
or ethnicity on the case report form (CRF), as well as cu rrent medical conditions and recent medical history and the use 
of antipyretic medications, including medication, dosage and time of administration. Immunization within the prior 
seven (7) days of data collection will also be recorded on the CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Record the use of external heating or cooling on participant during the course of their participation on the CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Record room temperature on the CRF using an ambient thermometer.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Record start and end time of data collection procedures on the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Take the screening temperature measurement using the same thermometer to be used for the reference measurements, 
immediately before beginning the study measurements. The subject should be withdrawn from the study if they do not 
meet the criteria for temperature which is 99.5oF/37.5oC for temperature taken sublingually using the Root DQG  
100.4oF/38oC for temporal artery temperature taken using the Exergen thermometer. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reference Measurements:  Sublingual temperature measurements are pref erred over temporal artery measurements. For 
participants suitable for sublingual measurement, reference temperature measurements will be obtained using the Root 
monitor’s (see Figure 3) integrated sublingual thermometer or  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s standard of care sublingual thermometer.  
 
Figure 3:  Masimo Root with Noninvasive Blood Pressure and Temperature Monitoring 
For younger participants who are unlikely to tolerate a sublingual thermometer measurement, perform temporal artery 
reference measurements using a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329813]. Multiple reference measurements may be 
obtained.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Rad-G with Temperature Device Measurements : To obtain measurements using the Rad-G with Temperature device, 
start by [CONTACT_329829] (Figure 4a) and sensor  lens (Figure 4b). Make sure there are no obstructions to 
the sensor’s field of view (i.e., hair, glasses, fingers, clothing).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Press and hold the thermometer button on the Rad-G screen (Figure 4a) and align the sensor lens with the center of the 
subject’s forehead (Figure 4c) at a distan ce of approximately 1-2”. A first audible b eep will indicate that the thermometer 
button has been pressed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  After aligning the sensor, with minimal movement, release the thermometer button on the Rad-G screen (Figure 4a). A 
second audible beep will indicate the start of a measurement followed by a third beep at the end of the measurement.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  The three measurements need to be taken in quick succession of each other, with approximately 3 seconds between each 
measurement and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_329814]-G with Temperature positioning for all three measurements. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Be sure to keep the Rad-G device steady during the measurement.

[IP_ADDRESS].  In the calibration phase, the steps above will be repeated to obtain measurements for up to 3 rounds of measurements 
if the participant can tolerate the procedure. Wait a minimum of approximately 5 minutes between rounds of 
measurements. A complete round of measurement is consider ed to be one reference and three Rad-G measurements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  In the validation phase, only one round of measurements will be obtained per subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Data from the Rad-G with Temperature device will be downloaded using Masimo Trace software on the data 
collection laptop at the end of each day. Reference data from the Root monitor will be downloaded to the data 
collection laptop using a USB flash drive. 
6.6. Monitoring plan 
As the sponsor of this clinical investigation, Masimo Corporation is required by 21 CFR Part 812, of the Food and Drug 
Administration regulations to monitor and oversee the progress of the investigation.  The monitor(s) assigned by [CONTACT_329830]. 
In accordance with good clinical practices guidelines, there will be at least three scheduled monitoring visits to ensure overa ll 
regulatory compliance of the study: 
x An initiation visit, prior to any participant enrollment to confirm site readiness, and to document training on the study 
protocol and procedures, and use of equipment. 
x At least one monitoring visit during initial enrollment, and/or every 2-[ADDRESS_407589] access to all source documents nee ded 
to verify the entries in the CRFs and other GCP-related documents (IRB approvals, IRB correspondences, and ICFs) provided that 
participant confidentiality is maintained in agreement with HIPAA regulations.  
It will be the monitor’s responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the

During each visit, the monitor will also verify adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and documentation of SAEs/SADEs 
and protocol deviations/violations, and check CRF against source documentation. 
After each visit, the monitor will provide a monitoring letter to the investigator within 4 weeks of visit completion. The 
monitoring letter will detail findings and open action items observed during the visit. It is the responsibility of the Princip al 
Investigator and Study Coordinator(s) to respond to the findings of the monitoring letter and complete any open action items as  
soon as possible but no later than 60 days of receiving the monitoring letter. Any open action items not completed within the t ime 
allowed may be sufficient grounds for study site suspension or termination; it will be up to the sponsor to determine whether a ny 
incomplete action items are sufficient grounds for suspension or termination. Depending on the quality of the data and/or chang es 
to factors affecting patient safety, additional monitoring visits may be necessary according at the sponsor’s discretion. 
7. STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

a. Background  
The incidence of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) after surgery varies widely from 3 -
50% and depends on various patient - and procedural -related factors [1, 2]. In an era of fast -
track surgery and enhanced recovery, urinary retention has emerged as one of the most 
common barriers to successful same -day discharge. Risk factors for POUR include male 
gender, age >50, prolonged surgery, excessive intraoperative flui ds, and use of 
anticholinergics [3]. POUR can contribute to a prolonged PACU stay, patient discomfort, and 
unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Acute urinary retention can impair renal glomerular and tubular function [4]. POUR is usually treated with urethral catheterization, which is uncomfortable, and 
can increase the risk for infection and trauma to the urogenital tract [5] . It is estimated that 
POUR accounts for between 20- 25% of unplanned inpatient admissions following planned 
outpatient surgery [6, 7] . 
 
Adequate muscle relaxation is necessary for laparoscopic procedures. Residual neuromuscular blockade is common and has been proven to lead to a multitude of adverse effects including increased postoperative pulmonary complications, longer length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210], and decreased quality of recovery [8, 9] . At present, it is recommended that all patients 
Form A  
IRB #  STU-[ADDRESS_615501] a 
documented TOF >90% prior to extubation [10] . 
 
Neostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) is frequently used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. However, it is associated with significant muscarinic side effects (i.e., bradycardia) and must be co- administered with an anticholinergic such as gl ycopyrrolate. 
Contraction of the detrusor and internal urethral sphincter are controlled by [CONTACT_479339] [11] . Numerous studies have found that administration of 
glycopyrrolate intraoperatively increase the risk of POUR [11, 12] . 
 Sugammadex is a selective relaxant binding agent which does not have any cholinergic effects and thus does not contribute to POUR. Previous studies have found that the use of sugammadex was associated with a lower incidence of POUR in patients undergoing t otal 
knee arthroplasty, inguinal hernia repair, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy [13 -15]. 
 
 
b. Current practice  
Current practice at Parkland shows that about half of patients undergoing laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy are reversed with sugammadex and half are reversed with neostigmine. The incidence of POUR in these patients is unknown because there have not been any formal studies to evaluate this outcome. There are no prospective, randomized studies evaluating the 
incidence of POUR from reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine versus sugammadex in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.   Most previous studies 
have been retrospective or did not examine POUR as the primary outcome.

1) Order in which tests/procedures will be performed  
 
Screening and Informed Consent:  
A member of the research team will use a screening form to look for surgical patients that meet all 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. He/she will approach potential subjects in the preoperative area and the study will be explained in detail in a private room. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to the neostigmine or sugammadex groups in a 1:1 ratio using a web -based 
randomization code.  
These assignments will be written and put into an envelope which will be 
given to the anesthesia provider to open once a patient is consented.  
 
Baseline Subjective Measures:  
In the preoperative area, and demographic information will be gathered from Epic .

V2Mar2018 Anesthesia Protocol:   
The anesthesia team that will be caring for the patient during surgery will be given the protocol for 
the study, which standardizes the general anesthetic technique. A study member will provide the anesthesia team with an envelope containing which group the patient has been randomized into (neostigmine versus sugammadex). If the patient has been randomized to the neostigmine group, the drug will be drawn from the Pyxis per usual practice. If the patient has been randomized to the 
sugammadex group, an order will be sent to investigational drug services pharmacy (IDS) to draw 
up the sugammadex (see attachment, IDS order form). IDS Pharmacy will only be providing 
sugammadex if the patient has been randomized to that group.  
 
Subjects will receive 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium for neuromuscular paralysis for induction.  Additional 
rocuronium will be given in 0.15 mg/kg increments to facilitate neuromuscular relaxation. All 
patients will have the depth of neuromuscular block monitored quantitatively at the adductor pollicis 
with a TwitchView electromyography -based device (Blink, Seattle, WA) that provides real time 
feedback of the strength of contraction and graphically displays the relevant ratios.  Assessments of depth of neuromuscular blockade will be recorded into the patient’s electronic medical record every 15 minutes following intubation.  Maintenance of anesthesia will be with sevoflurane in 50% oxygen. All patients will have a forced air warming device (e.g., Bair Hugger, 3M, Maplewood, MN) used to maintain normothermia throughout the surgery.   
 At the end of surgery, reversal of neuromuscular blockade will be achieved with either neostigmine or sugammadex and the patient will be extubated when the TOF ≥0.9. If the patient 
has been randomized into the sugammadex group, it will be prepared into a syringe by a pharmacist in Investigational Drug Service (IDS) Pharmacy. Sugammadex will be provided to IDS Pharmacy from the study sponsor, [COMPANY_006]. IDS Pharmacy will only be responsible for providing sugammadex, and only if the patient has been randomized to that group. The 
remaining aspects of the anesthetic will be standardized and not differ from the standard of care for all patients.  
 Patients will then be taken to the PACU and monitored according to established guidelines.   
Randomization & Dosing:  
Patients will be randomized to one of two groups for neuromuscular blockade and reversal of 
neuromuscular paralysis:  
1. Group 1 - rocuronium + neostigmine (NEO group)  
a. Induction: 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium  
b. Maintenance: additional boluses of 0.15 mg/kg rocuronium  
c. Reversal:  
i. TOF 0 -1 twitch - delay reversal  
ii. TOF <0.4 - 50-70 mcg/kg neostigmine (max 5 mg) + 10 mcg/kg 
glycopyrrolate (max 1 mg)  
iii. TOF 0.4 -0.9- 20-40 mcg/kg neostigmine + 5 mcg/kg glycopyrrolate  
 
2. Group 2 - rocuronium + sugammadex (SUG group)  
a. Induction: 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium  
b. Maintenance: additional boluses of 0.15 mg/kg rocuronium

V2Mar2018 c. Reversal:  
i. TOF < 2 twitches - 4 mg/kg sugammadex  
ii. TOF ≥ 2 twitches - 2 mg/kg sugammadex  
 
The statistician will make randomization envelopes by [CONTACT_2329] a random number generator.  These envelopes will be provided to the anesthesia team after subjects are consented. The anesthesia team will be responsible for opening the envelope to discover which group the patient has been 
randomized to. The words ‘neostigmine’ or ‘sugammadex’ will be printed on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_479333] a unique subject number. If the patient has been randomized into the neostigmine group, the anesthesia provider will draw up the drug from the Pyxis. If the patient has been randomized into the sugammadex group, the study team will contact [CONTACT_479340]. It is solely the responsibility of the research team to contact [CONTACT_479341].  
 
PACU Assessment:  
A blinded, trained research assistant will observe and record all parameters from the time the 
patient arrives in the PACU until they are discharged from the PACU. Any drugs given in the PACU will be recorded. The patient will be asked to void [ADDRESS_615503] void residual will be obtained with an ultrasound. The bladder scan will be administered 60 min after arrival to the PACU .  
 POUR will be defined as:  
1. Inability to spontaneously urinate and a bladder volume ≥ 300 mL [ 16-17] 
2. Postvoid residual > 15 0 mL [18- 19] 
3. Need for insertion of Foley catheter or straight catheter [20]

2) Setting and Methods used to Protect Privacy  
Setting  
The study will take place in the pre- operative rooms, the operating rooms, and the PACU at 
Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
A non -identifiable code will be assigned to the data collection sheet so that there is not a direct 
link to specific names.  Patient IDs will be standardized in chronological order as subject 1, subject 2, etc. A key to the coding system will be maintained  in a locked storage cabinet with limited access 
until all the data is collected and analyzed. Access to study data will be restricted to authorized 
study personnel only. Following the completion of the analysis and the project, the key to the 
coding syste m or subject identifiers themselves will be destroyed by [CONTACT_479342].  
 All data from the study will be kept on encrypted computers belonging to the University, which are stored in secured areas. All electronic study data will be password protected and passwords will 
be changed on a regular basis.  
 
All data will be de -identified when exported from the REDCap database.  Patient data will be 
analyzed without patient identifiers by [CONTACT_89894]- linked from 
patient identifiers.  Signed consent forms, and HIPAA forms, will remain in a locked cabinet in the 
PI’s office.  
 
3) Plan for Data Analysis  
Statistics:  
Form A  
IRB #  STU-[ADDRESS_615504] been collected.  
 
Sample Size Justification:  
 Sample size was calculated assuming the POUR incidence rates of 3% and 13% for the sugammadex and neostigmine groups, respectively.   To detect a difference of 10% with 80% 
power and 5% Type I error rate (one- sided), the estimated sample size is 115 for eac h group.  
 
The primary outcome is the incidence rates of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) of 
sugammadex and neostigmine groups. The difference of the incidence rates between groups will be analyzed using the z test with a significance level of 5%.  
 Based upon a sample size of n= 115 patients per group, this study has 80% power and 5% Type I 
error rate (one -sided) to detect a 10% difference between groups in the incidence of POUR. This 
calculation is based on prior published research estimating the incidence of POUR to be 3% and 13% for the sugammadex and neostigmine groups, respectively.

5.  Safety Precautions.  (Describe safeguards to address the serious risks listed above.)  
a.  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks for each of the more than minimal risk 
research procedures  listed above.  
Potential Risks:  
The additional risks posed by [CONTACT_479343].  There is a potential for a direct benefit to the patient if they receive sugammadex, based on available literature, 
which reports that sugammadex is superior to neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade [7-17].  The anesthetic management of subjects will not differ from the standard care.  Patients will be randomized to receive either neostigmine or sugam madex for reversal of neuromuscular paralysis.  
 
Risk of Sugammadex:  
The most common adverse reactions after administration of sugammadex are nausea/vomiting, pain, hypotension, and 
headache. There is a 0.3% chance of an allergic reaction to sugammadex. Female subjects who are using oral contraceptives 
will be informed during the consenting process that they will need to use a non-hormonal method of contraception for 7 days if 
they are randomized to sugammadex.  Women who do not wish to do this will not be enrolled in the study.  Women who do choose to participate will be provided a letter (in English or Spanish) with this information and phone number of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_479334].   
Form A  
IRB #  STU-[ADDRESS_615506] Safety and Data Monitoring:  
Study oversight will include a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The DSMB will be chaired by a faculty member that 
is not the PI [INVESTIGATOR_479335], critical care medicine, and surgery.  
The DSMB will meet quarterly as needed to review all patient enrollments.  If necessary, the DSMB will meet more often to review specific study subjects,  unanticipated events, protocol violations, and adverse events.  All study subjects will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_479344] -related adverse outcomes.  A written record of all meetings will be kept.  The IRB will be notified in 
writing of any adverse study -related outcomes.  
 
Blinding/Un- blinding:  
The patient  and the postoperative evaluator will be blinded as to which reversal agent the patient receives. The anesthesia 
team taking care of the patient in the operating room will not be blinded, meaning they will know which reversal agent the pa tient 
receives.  A member of the research team will provide the randomization envelopes to the anesthesia provider to open to 
determine which study group the patient has been assigned to. They will then contact [CONTACT_479345], if necessary.

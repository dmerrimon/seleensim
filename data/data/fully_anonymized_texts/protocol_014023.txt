Ver.8. 15.14.jrs  BACKGROUND, RATIONALE, AND CONTEXT  
Interstitial cystitis (IC), also referred to as painful bladder syndrome (PBS), is a 
heterogenous chronic disease of unknown etiology that impacts up to 8 million women in 
America.1 Patients suffer from vague pelvic pain that can be exacerbated by [CONTACT_125020], and is often associated with urinary frequency and urgency.2 Since Alexander 
Skene’s inception of the term in 1887, research into the etiology and pathophysiology of 
this d isease has not been successful in elucidating a specific mechanism, revealing more 
questions than answers. As a result, treatment is difficult. Although there are many oral, 
intravesicular, and procedural treatments available, many patients remain refracto ry and 
require a more substantial treatment. Onabotulinumtoxin A may be that treatment.  
 
Onabotulinumtoxin A has long been considered an efficacious treatment for various 
bladder pathologies such as overactive bladder (OAB) and neurogenic bladder. For the  
treatment of IC current AUA guidelines list intradetrusor Onabotulinumtoxin A injections 
as a fifth -line treatment option with grade C evidence (observational studies that are 
inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound 
interpretation of data).3 This option is based upon six observational studies that 
demonstrated highly variable amounts of short and long efficacy rates (from 20% to 86% 
at 3 months).4–[ADDRESS_140494] con firmed 
Onabotulinumtoxin A’s efficacy.10,11 While prior studies demonstrated the efficacy of 
intravesicular Onabotulinumtoxin A as a treatment, they largely did not address the 
importance of injection location. With the majority of bladder nociceptor and 
parasympathetic fibers located in the trigone,10–12it stands to reason that injections to this 
area should have a more significant effect on bladder pain than injections elsewhere. The 
purpose of this study is to identify the importance of injection locatio n for intravesicular 
Onabotulinumtoxin A.  
 
We hypothesize that injections into the trigone should be more effective in the treatment 
of IC than injections elsewhere in the bladder. The lack of evidence on this topic has been 
noted by [CONTACT_125021] i s important to the understanding and future use of 
Onabotulinumtoxin A in the treatment of IC.  
 
Objectives  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravesicular Onabotulinumtoxin 
A injections for the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC). Specifically, we hypothesize that 
trigonal Onabotulinumtoxin A injections is an effective treatment for IC and will result in 
more subjective and objective symptom relief than posterior wall Onabotulinumtoxin A 
injections.  
 
Specific Aims  
Patients dia gnosed as having refractory IC will receive a one time dose of intravesicular 
Onabotulinumtoxin A with injections randomly assigned to either the posterior wall or 
trigone. Patients will be evaluated for subjective IC symptoms and objective flow 
performanc e prior to treatment as well as [ADDRESS_140495] Medical Center 
with interstitial cystitis f or whom conservative management/ oral medications have failed  
and Onabotulinumtoxin A is recommended . These patients will all have undergone  
evaluation by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert Evans:  an expert in the management of pelvic pain syndromes 
who sees >[ADDRESS_140496] of the trigone  of the urinary 
bladder . Meanwhile, those subjects  randomized to the control cohort will also receive a 
one time dose of Onabotulinumtoxin A using the same dilution and number of boluses , 
but boluses will be administered at random sites on the posterior bladd er wall (excluding 
the trigone ). Post –treatment, subjects will remain at the site for at least [ADDRESS_140497] also demonstrat e 
their ability to void before leaving.

in IC diagnosis and assessment of disease severity and response to treatment, and are part 
of routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. These include the O’Leary -Sant Interstitial 
and the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Sc ale (PUF).  Each of 
these questionnaires are well established in the literature to help the urologist identify and 
treat patients with IC.  Their scores on these questionnaires must >10 for either the ICSS 
or ICPI, and >10 on the PUF.  Both the O’Leary/San t questionnare and PUF questionnare  
ask about the voiding patterns and pain levels of IC patients.   
 
Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects should  only be included if they meet  the following conditions:  
1.  Adult  females between the ages of  [ADDRESS_140499]. Robert Evans , an expert 
in the management of pelvic pain syndromes who sees >300 new patients each 
year. Subjects will be drawn from the patient population undergoing chronic 
management for their IC. The clinical diagnosis of IC will be based on the 
recently published AUA Guidelines definition: “An unpleasant sensation (pain, 
pressure, or discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated 
with lower urinary tract symptoms for more than six weeks duration, in the 
absence of infection or other identifi able causes.”  
Exclusion Critera  
Subjects should be excluded if any of the following applies:  
1. Any history of bladder cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, vaginal 
cancer, urethral diverticulum, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], stroke, Parkinson’s 
disease, multiple scl erosis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_113163], cyclophosphamide treatment, 
radiation treatment to the pelvis, bladder tuberculosis, genital herpes.  
2. Currently on or requiring anti -platelet/anti -coagulant concomitant therapy 
or having been on anti -platelet/ anti -coagulant therapy wi thin the past [ADDRESS_140500] -void residual (PVR) urine volume >200mL at baseline  
7. Treatment with botuli num toxin during the [ADDRESS_140501] of 20 subjec ts for a total study population of 40. This number 
was chosen using estimates of symptom relief using our current patient population as 
reference.  
Patients will be randomized to either the control or experimental cohort using a computer 
generated randomiza tion table. Providers will not be aware of the subjects’ cohort status 
until immediately prior to injection.  
 
 
Power Analysis  
We expect that treatment will result in a large effect and as such have set an anticipated 
Cohen's d as 0.95. Using this value along with standard study values of α=0.05 and 
β=0.80 we calculated a minimum total study group requirement of 38 subjects with 19 
subjects in each arm.  
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
The primary outcome will be a measurement of subjective patient pain using the Pelvic 
Pain and Urinary Urgency Frequency (PUF) questionnaire and the O’Leary -Sant 
Symptom and Problem Indexes. Patients will be asked to complete this questionnaire 
prior to tr eatment administration and at [ADDRESS_140502] treatment. The PUF and 
O’Leary Sant are previously validated tools that have been used by [CONTACT_125022]. Secondary outcomes will be objective data as to patient 
performance in  uroflowmetry as well as measurement of post void residuals. Patients will

follow -up. We estimate that the total study time (including IRB approval, patient 
recruitment, treatment, and data analysis following treatment) to be approximately 1 year 
and 4 months.  
 
  Human Subjects Protection  
Informed Consent:  An IRB approved written informed consent will be obtained from 
each subject.  [CONTACT_125025] rt Evans or the study coordinator will consent each of the potential 
subjects.  Informed consent will be acquired in the day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125018], or in the Wake Forest University Urology Out -patient Clinic.  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy:  Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_125023] (i.e. patient’s age and patient 
gender), minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that 
could directly identify sub jects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner.  
To help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will 
appear on the data collection form.  Any collected patient identifying information 
corresponding to th e unique study identifier will be maintained on a separate master log.  
The master log will be kept secure, with access limited to designated study personnel.  
Following data collection subject identifying information will be destroyed at the earliest 
oppo rtunity, consistent with data validation and study design, producing an anonymous 
analytical data set.  Data access will be limited to study staff.  Data and records will be 
kept locked and secured, with any computer data password protected.  No reference to 
any individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may 
arise from the study.  
 
  Data and Safety Monitoring

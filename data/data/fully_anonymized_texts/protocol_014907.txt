Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people 
over age 65 in the [LOCATION_002], is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal degeneration 
occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to impairment of central 
visual acuity (VA). AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which involves choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar. This is often referred to 
as the neovascular or “wet” form. A second form, the subject of this study, is termed “dry” 
/atrophic macular degeneration or otherwise “geographic atrophy” (GA) and involves a slow 
progressive atrophy of retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_43698] (RPE) cells and photoreceptors in the macula, 
also resulting in central vision loss. GA is estimated to affect up to one million persons in the U.S. 
and there is no current treatment that can prevent its onset or retard its progression. 
While the etiology of GA is not completely understood, inflammatory processes involving the 
activation of resident immune cells of the retina called microglia is likely to contribute. 
Minocycline inhibits the activation of microglia which produce inflammatory factors implicated 
in GA development. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and possible efficacy 
of oral minocycline in patients with GA.
Study Population: Forty-five participants with unilateral or bilateral GA associated with AMD 
will be enrolled. However, up to an additional [ADDRESS_627696] 
participants who may withdraw from the study prior to reaching the Month 33 visit.
Design: This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, Phase II study to evaluate minocycline as 
a potential treatment to decrease the rate of worsening of GA associated with AMD. 
Participants will undergo a nine-month run-in phase prior to receiving investigational product (IP). 
During this run-in phase, participants will have a total of four pre-treatment visits. Following the 
run-in phase, beginning at Month 9, participants will receive an oral dose of 100 mg of minocycline 
twice daily for 36 months (i.e., through Month 45). There will be a common termination date, 
which will take place when the last recruited participant has received 36 months of treatment. 
Participants who were recruited in the earlier part of the study will continue treatment and be 
followed every six months until the common termination date. However, participants may 
complete participation in the study as early as Month 45, at the discretion of the investigator.

Template version date 07-29-2019Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA based on grading 
by [CONTACT_488635] (FAF) images in the assigned study eye. 
The primary outcome will compare the rates of GA area expansion as determined on FAF images 
before and following the initiation of IP until [ADDRESS_627697]-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance 
VA, area of GA based on FAF (using a different statistical approach compared to primary 
outcome) and fundus photography. The exploratory outcome will compare the difference in the 
rate of change in macular sensitivity as measured using microperimetry. This outcome was 
originally a secondary outcome when the clinical trial participants were enrolled, since these 
represent visual function data corresponding closely to areas affected by [CONTACT_488636]. 
Hence, changes in microperimetry data over time might be well placed to support changes in 
structural data over time, as geographic atrophy lesions undergo enlargement. In the original 
Statistical Analysis Plan, the intention was that “Macular sensitivity, as measured on 
microperimetry, will be evaluated in a similar manner as BCVA”, (i.e., “Mean rate of change in 
BCVA during the treatment phase will be compared to the mean rate of change in BCVA during 
the run-in phase using Student’s paired t-test”). However, microperimetry data (represented by 
[CONTACT_488637], one for each anatomical location, at each time-point) are much more 
complex than BCVA data (represented by a single numerical value at each time-point). 
The originally proposed statistical treatment is therefore not suitable. In addition, the study team 
is not aware of any established methods accepted by [CONTACT_488638], unlike the situation for BCVA. Indeed, the microperimetry acquisition pattern used in 
GA MIN is unique and was developed specifically for this trial. It therefore needs its own dedicated 
set of statistical analyses (which may need several iterations), rather than pre-specified and widely 
accepted analyses that could be detailed in advance in the Statistical Analysis Plan. For these 
reasons, although the original intention was for the microperimetry data to represent a secondary 
outcome measure, it is better suited to an exploratory outcome measure. Safety outcomes will 
include the number and severity of adverse events (AEs). Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated 
by [CONTACT_488639], ocular surface changes, intraocular inflammation and any other ocular changes 
not consistent with the natural progression of GA.

1.1 Age-related Macular Degeneration
AMD is the leading cause of late onset visual impairment and legal blindness in people 65 years 
of age or older in the [LOCATION_002] (1, 2). The World Health Organization has placed AMD as the 
third leading cause of blindness worldwide. The phrase “age-related” is associated with macular 
degeneration because data show that the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_488603] 
60. It is estimated that [ADDRESS_627698] indicated the role of 
inflammation. Complement factor H (CFH) is a major regulatory factor in the complement 
cascade. Several groups have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CFH gene 
that are associated with AMD. A single copy of the risk-associated haplotype increases the risk of 
AMD by [CONTACT_1192]- to four-fold, whereas those with a dual copy may increase their lifetime risk by 
[CONTACT_325501]- to seven-fold (3-7). Macrophages are known to have an important role in the initiation and 
maintenance of the immune response, including the regulation of complement activation. 
Previous studies have shown that patients with AMD were more likely to have circulating, 
activated macrophages (which produce high amounts of proinflammatory cytokines) compared to 
controls without AMD (8).

classic laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy (verteporfin, Visudyne) and anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pegylated aptamer (pegaptanib sodium, Macugen), an 
anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies ranibizumab (Lucentis) and aflibercept.

randomized, controlled clinical trial of high-dose vitamins C and E, beta carotene and zinc 
supplements demonstrated a 25% reduction in the risk of progression to late AMD (9). 
However, this effect appears to be limited to reducing risk for progressing to neovascular AMD 
and does not influence the risk for progression to GA (unpublished data).
There are currently no available treatments or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_488604], slowing the progression of disease, or improving vision of affected

2.1 Microglial Involvement in the Inflammatory Etiology of AMD
While the etiology of AMD is not completely understood, chronic neuroinflammation in the retina 
is thought to play an important causative role (13). Genetic analyses have implicated immune 
molecules, particularly those in the complement system, in conferring risk for AMD (14-16). 
Drusen, the hallmark of early and intermediate AMD, contain complement molecules (11, 17), as 
well as oxidation products from lipid and carbohydrates that can initiate inflammatory and immune 
responses (18, 19).
Microglia are the primary resident immune cells in the retina and are implicated in the response 
and propagation of relevant pathological inflammatory processes in AMD (13). 
Activated microglia and macrophages have been found in the outer retina of AMD eyes (20, 21) 
and in close proximity to GA lesions (22). In mouse models of AMD, outer retinal accumulations 
of activated microglia are prominent and associated with late AMD lesions. Activated microglia 
in the outer retina appear capable of inducing cellular changes in the outer retina that characterize 
GA, such as the loss in RPE integrity and regularity (23), as well as photoreceptor cell death (24). 
Inhibition of microglia/macrophage recruitment to the outer retina in mouse models decreases 
photoreceptor degeneration in AMD-related animal models, further implicating their causal role 
(25). As a result, inhibition of microglial activation may be a promising therapeutic approach in 
AMD (26) in limiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in the outer retina and 
arresting/retarding progressive RPE and photoreceptor degeneration in GA.
2.2 Minocycline as an Inhibitor of Microglial Activation: Preclinical Studies
Minocycline is a member of the tetracycline family of antibiotics that in addition to its 
antimicrobial properties acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and an inhibitor of microglial 
activation (27, 28). Minocycline can exert its anti-inflammatory effects on microglia in culture, 
inhibiting proliferation and release of proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NO), and 
promoting production of nerve growth factor (NGF), leading to decreased inflammatory cell death 
and increased neuroprotection (29-31). Minocycline crosses the blood-Central Nervous System 
(CNS) barrier readily, providing high bioavailability in the CNS; as a result, it has been evaluated

Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019as a therapy in a number of animal disease models where microglial-mediated neuroinflammation 
features. In a mouse model of diabetic retinopathy, systemic minocycline decreased inflammatory 
cytokine production, reduced the release of cytotoxins from activated microglia, and lowered 
the rate of apoptosis in the retina (32). In a mouse model of subretinal hemorrhage, 
intraperitoneally-administered minocycline reduced microglial infiltration into the outer retina and 
delayed consequent photoreceptor atrophy (33). In mouse models of retinal degeneration in which 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production and microglial activation occur (34-38), systemic 
minocycline was found effective in slowing down the rate of photoreceptor cell death (39, 40).
2.3 Minocycline: Clinical Use and Clinical Studies
Minocycline is FDA-approved for treating infectious disorders and is indicated for the treatment 
of various gram-positive and -negative bacteria. In ophthalmology, oral minocycline is commonly 
used for the treatment of blepharitis and ocular rosacea (41). It has a favorable side-effect profile, 
although it should not be used in pregnancy as the use of tetracycline class of drugs during tooth 
development may cause permanent tooth discoloration.
Oral minocycline is used widely and has been shown to be well tolerated when used at the 
FDA-approved doses. A study comparing the AEs reported with the number of prescriptions for 
minocycline for the years 1998 to 2003 estimated the rate to be 13 reported AEs per million 
prescriptions per year (42). The majority of these events were gastrointestinal upset, 
photosensitivity, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and tooth discoloration.
Minocycline has also been used in clinical trials as an inhibitor of microglial activation. In a 
clinical trial of acute stroke, 74 patients treated with oral minocycline (200 mg) for five days 
demonstrated a significantly better neurological outcome compared with 77 patients on placebo 
(43). Minocycline is currently being investigated in ongoing clinical studies to decrease symptom 
progression in Huntington’s disease ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and to provide neuroprotection in 
Parkinson’s disease ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
In the area of retinal diseases, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof-of-concept study of diabetic macular edema reported 
an association between oral minocycline administration and improved visual function, retinal 
edema, and vascular leakage ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (44).

Template version date 07-29-[ZIP_CODE].0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
5.1 Study Overview
This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, Phase II clinical trial of up to 45 participants with 
GA associated with AMD. The amended study design relies on the linearity of the GA expansion 
rate in the natural history of the disease in a single eye using the square root transformation of the 
GA area. The linearity of GA expansion rate over the time scales relevant to the study were verified 
in exploratory analyses on two previous GA studies Othera (NEI Protocol 06-EI-0116) and SIRGA 
(NEI Protocol 09-EI-0008).
Participants will undergo a nine-month run-in period prior to receiving IP. Starting at Month 9 
(IP start visit), participants will receive [ADDRESS_627705] 36 months (i.e., through Month 45). All participants will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_627706] of the 
participants for this study can be recruited from the current patient population with GA and AMD 
at the NEI retina clinic. The study will also rely on referrals from physicians at Kaiser Permanente 
and other local eye clinics. A recruitment flyer will be posted at community gathering places 
including but not limited to: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], libraries, senior centers, senior housing facilities, area metro 
and bus stops, websites, newspapers and throughout the NIH campus. Recruitment materials such 
as letters to physicians and potential participants will be used. It is anticipated that all participants 
will be recruited within 12 months.
12
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019Approximately 20-25 participants will be recruited from the BEH site. Participants from this site 
will be identified following attendance at routine outpatient appointments or sent a recruitment 
letter from existing databases of patients diagnosed with GA and AMD and who routinely attend 
the BEH site for treatment.
It is anticipated that all participants will be recruited within 12 months. The recruitment totals are 
not fixed at each site. No more than 30 participants will be enrolled at either the NEI or [LOCATION_006] site.
5.3 Screening
Consent will be obtained before any study procedures are done, including any screening 
procedures that may be done under this current protocol. At the NEI clinic, all potential participants 
will undergo a screening visit in the NEI ophthalmology clinic to determine whether they meet the 
eligibility criteria. Potential participants will be screened under protocols such as the NEI 
screening protocol (NIH Protocol 08-EI-0102), AREDS follow-up protocol (NIH Protocol 
08-EI-0043), Biobank protocol (NIH Protocol 12-EI-0042), or DA AMD protocol (NIH Protocol 
11-EI-0147) to establish eligibility. Each potential participant must have an active signed consent 
for one of the above-mentioned protocols on file in order to allow for screening examination. 
The following tests are performed during the screening protocols and may be used for the initial 
study visit for the current protocol if they are performed within the specified time frames:
1. Stereoscopic color fundus photography, FAF and infrared reflectance imaging, 
microperimetry, and OCT performed within 30 days prior to the initial study visit.
2. Physical examination (including thyroid palpation), acute care panel, hepatic panel, 
complete blood count (CBC) and thyroid function test (TFT) performed within 60 days 
prior to the initial study visit.
Evaluations previously performed outside of the windows indicated above may be used to 
determine participant eligibility, and these evaluations will be repeated under this study at the 
initial study visit. At any time during the screening process, the participant may enroll in this 
current protocol by [CONTACT_12142]’s consent form and may complete any remaining screening 
and baseline procedures under this protocol, with final determination of eligibility. Women of 
childbearing potential (see Appendix 1 for definition) must have a negative test within 24 hours

enrollment. If a participant is unable to complete microperimetry testing, the microperimetry 
testing may be waived for subsequent study visits and the investigator will specify the reason the 
test could not be completed. All other screening procedures will not be repeated. 
These screening/initial study visit examinations are outlined in Appendix 2. The enrolling 
Investigator will confirm that all eligibility criteria have been met. If determined eligible, the 
participant will sign the informed consent and enroll at his/her initial study visit.
At the BEH site, all potential participants will only be screened under this study protocol.

visit. Therefore, participants enrolled at the beginning of the study could receive additional months 
of IP beyond the scheduled 36 months. However, participants may complete participation in the 
study as early as Month 45, at the discretion of the investigator. Although participants may 
withdraw from IP during the study, all participants will be asked to return for all visits through 
their study termination visit.
5.5 Study Procedures
The study will require a minimum of 11 visits (Months 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39 and 45). 
All visits must be conducted within a window of  [ADDRESS_627709] 12 months. At or prior to 
the IP start visit, the participant will undergo a complete vital sign assessment and a complete

Template version date 07-29-2019review of systems. Comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations and safety assessments will be 
performed as outlined in the study flowsheet (Appendix 2).
If participants are on anticoagulation at enrollment, they must visit their prescribing physician to 
check their anticoagulation status within two-four weeks after initiating IP to have their 
anticoagulation regimen adjusted if necessary (as taking minocycline may require an increase of 
anticoagulation medication dose).
Participant compliance with study IP administration will be prompted through ongoing 
encouragements and reminders during study visits and scheduled and unscheduled telephone 
contacts. Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_488644]. 
Overall compliance rate based on previous long-term studies in AMD with twice daily dosing is 
expected to be fairly good (about five out of six participants took >75% of the study IP) (50c). 
Occurrences in which the computed compliance rate between study visits falls below 50% will be 
reported as a protocol deviation.
5.6 Ocular and Systemic Evaluations
Over the course of the study, participants will undergo the following ocular and systemic 
evaluations as outlined in the study flowsheet (see Appendix 2):
1. Medical/Ophthalmic History
2. Concomitant Medications Assessment
3. Vital Signs
4. Physical Examination

5.7 Study and Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
5.7.1 Formulation of Minocycline at NEI
At the NEI site, minocycline hydrochloride capsules for oral administration containing the 
equivalent of 100 mg of minocycline will be investigated under Investigational New Drug (IND) 
Number 108,154.
5.7.2 Formulation of Minocycline at BEH 
At the BEH site, minocycline hydrochloride capsules for oral administration containing the 
equivalent of 100 mg of minocycline will be investigated under European Clinical Trials Database. 
5.8 Dosage, Administration and Storage 
Adult participants will be instructed to take their prescribed IP orally two times a day, once in the 
morning and once in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart. The capsules will be dispensed to 
the participant in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia 
(USP) in three-month supply aliquots. Starting at Month 9 and continuing at Month 12, a three-
month supply will be dispensed to the participant during the study visit or mailed to the participant. 
Participants will be given an instruction sheet for taking the prescribed IP (Appendix 4). Starting 
at Month 15 participants will receive two bottles for a six-month supply. The IP should be stored 
between 15-30°C (or 59-86°F). They should be protected from light, moisture, and excessive heat. 
Participants will be required to bring their bottles of IP to each appropriate visit for capsule counts 
for compliance monitoring.

Version Date: August 15, [ADDRESS_627713] Accountability
The indicated pharmacy for each site is responsible for the accountability of all dispensed and 
returned IP. Adequate drug accountability records include documentation of all IP shipped, 
received, dispensed and returned to the indicated pharmacy. The investigator is responsible for the 
accountability of all dispensed IP at their respective site. Adequate drug accountability records 
include documentation of all IP prescribed by [CONTACT_32366]. Returned IP will be collected and 
stored by [CONTACT_488645] a secure location until reconciliation by [CONTACT_5081]. 
Following reconciliation by [CONTACT_5081], each pharmacy will dispose of returned IP.
5.11 Follow-up/Termination Procedures
At the conclusion of the study, participants will no longer be eligible to receive IP under this 
protocol.
At NEI, follow-up care will be arranged with either an outside ophthalmologist or the participant 
will continue to be seen at the NIH under another protocol if available and if the participant is 
eligible. The participant and his/her physician will be informed of the participant’s disease status 
during this study. Clinical data obtained during participation will be shared with participants and, 
with written permission from the participants, their private physicians. Results from the overall 
study will be listed on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov once the data have been analyzed.

6.0 RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
The anticipated discomforts and inconveniences of this protocol are those associated with the IP, 
the diagnostic procedures, and the time required for the participant to spend at the clinic.
6.1 Examination Risks
There are risks associated with the procedures required for participants in this study. Some of the 
discomforts associated with the ocular examination include the following:
1. Dilating drops or anesthetic drops may sting. They can cause an allergic reaction, or if 
contaminated, can cause an infection, but neither of these problems is very likely to occur. 
Dilating drops can also cause a sudden increase of pressure (acute glaucoma) in eyes that 
are already predisposed to develop this condition. There is little risk of glaucoma being 
triggered in this way, but if it is, treatment is available. The participant’s intraocular 
pressure will be obtained at each ophthalmic examination to determine whether there is an 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_69361].
2. Stereoscopic color fundus photographs involve a bright flash to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_486619]. 
This brief flash may cause temporary discomfort, but it does not damage the eye.
3. OCT and microperimetry are non-invasive tests used to document and analyze retinal 
pathology and have minimal medical risks.
4. The fluorescein dye used in FA can make a participant’s skin turn yellow for several hours. 
This yellow color is transient and usually disappears in one day. Because the dye undergoes 
renal excretion, the participant’s urine will turn dark orange for up to 24 hours after the

typi[INVESTIGATOR_488612]. Very rarely (less than one in one 
million people), a participant experiences anaphylaxis. This would be treated immediately 
by [CONTACT_214622], if necessary, intubation.
Possible discomforts associated with non-ocular examinations include:
1. Blood draws can cause discomfort and bleeding/bruising at the site of venous puncture. 
There is a remote risk of fainting or local infection. If any of these conditions arise, they 
will be treated.
2. The medical/ophthalmic history, vital signs, review of systems and pregnancy testing entail 
minimal medical risk.
6.1.[ADDRESS_627715] been observed in patients receiving 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_488613]:
Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, 
pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial over growth) in anogenital region and increases 
in liver enzymes. Rarely, hepatitis and liver failure have been reported. Rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class 
antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately 
before going to bed.
20
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019Skin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is 
uncommon. Fixed drug eruptions, including balanitis, have been rarely reported. 
Erythema multiforme and rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. 
Photosensitivity manifested by [CONTACT_214623]. This has been reported with minocycline. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_214583].
Renal toxicity: Elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported and are apparently 
dose related. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with 
significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, 
hyperphosphatemia and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses 
may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the IP and possible liver toxicity.
Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis, 
anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and rarely 
pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome has 
also been reported.
Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and eosinophilia have been reported.
Central Nervous System: Central nervous side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or 
vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Headache and blurred vision have also been 
reported. Serious neurologic events reported include bulging fontanels in infants and benign 
intracranial hypertension (Pseudotumor cerebri) in adults. 
Other: When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce 
brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid glands. Very rare cases of abnormal thyroid 
function have been reported. Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in 
association with minocycline products, although the incidence is presently unknown. The internal 
medicine consult service will perform thyroid palpation for Visit 000 and will communicate the 
results to the Investigators. The study investigators will perform the same thyroid palpation as 
outlined in the study flowsheet (Appendix 2). Any clinically significant abnormalities on thyroid

Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019palpation and/or thyroid function test (TFT) will prompt a referral to an endocrinologist. 
Decreased hearing has been rarely reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. 
Tooth discoloration in children less than eight years of age and, rarely, in adults has been reported. 
Use is not recommended for individuals of either gender attempting child conception. There is a 
risk of impaired spermatogenesis. Because tetracycline can reduce the amount of beneficial forms 
of bacteria in the body, participants will be counseled to include probiotics in their diet while 
participating in the study.
Pregnant and Nursing Women: Minocycline is in Pregnancy Category D and is excreted in 
human milk. Minocycline can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The use 
of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and 
childhood to the age of eight years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth 
(yellow-grey-brown).
6.1.[ADDRESS_627716] been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, participants who 
are on warfarin (Coumadin) may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to 
avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is 
impaired by [CONTACT_214624], calcium or magnesium, and also preparations that 
include iron. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in 
fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral 
contraceptives less effective. 
7.0 PARTICIPANT SAFETY MONITORING
Participants will be assessed during each study visit after initiation of IP for AEs by [CONTACT_488646]. At each visit after initiation of IP, the participant will be asked about any new ocular 
or systemic symptoms including rashes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214584]/changed medications. General and 
ophthalmic assessments will be performed according to Appendix 2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_488614].

Template version date 07-29-[ZIP_CODE].1 Participant Withdrawal Criteria
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. Participants may choose to withdraw from this study 
for any reason at any time without penalty, without loss of benefits or prohibition from enrolling 
in other clinical protocols. All participants will be included in the analyses at the end of the study.
The investigator may withdraw a participant at their discretion for the following reasons:
Investigator determination that it is not in the best medical interest of the participant to 
continue participation;
Findings in the course of the trial that may affect willingness to participate;
The development of AMD-related CNV in the study eye of the participant;
Participant requires additional medicines or subconjunctival or intravitreal injections that 
will interfere with the IP;
Pregnancy;
Serious suspected adverse reaction;
VA loss of >30 letters from initial study visit;
Any other safety concerns;
Inability to keep study visits or to comply with study requirements.
Discontinuation of IP does not require participant withdrawal from the protocol. If the participant 
agrees to continue in the study after discontinuing IP, s/he will continue to return for their 
subsequent study visits and undergo the required examinations. Otherwise, the participant will exit 
the study and continue his/her ophthalmic care either with an outside ophthalmologist or at the 
NEI. Participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_488647].
7.2 Pregnancy Monitoring
If an investigator becomes aware that a female study participant has become pregnant during the 
study, the investigator will advise the participant to stop taking the IP immediately. 
The investigator and participant will determine whether to continue any remaining study visits or 
to exit the study.
23
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019If an investigator becomes aware that a male study participant has impregnated his partner during 
the study, the investigator will remind the participant of the potential risks to the unborn fetus.
In either case of reported pregnancy, the participant (and/or partner) will be referred to the NIH 
OB/GYN consultation service for evaluation and counseling. The investigator must follow the 
participant (or partner) through the pregnancy outcome. The data must be recorded on the 
Confirmed Pregnancy and Outcome  form in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), which is also 
reported to the Coordinating Center.
8.0 OUTCOME MEASURES
8.1 Primary Outcome
The primary outcome is the difference in the rates of GA area expansion in the study eye between 
the run-in phase of the study and following IP initiation. GA area determination will be based on 
digital grading of FAF images by [CONTACT_488648]. The primary outcome will be the 
difference in the rate of GA area expansion from IP start visit (Month 9) to 24 months of treatment 
(Month 33) compared to initial study visit (Month 0) to IP start visit.
8.2 Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes will examine the differences in the rates of outcome measure progression in 
the study eyes between the run-in phase of the study and following IP initiation. These outcome 
measures include: GA area expansion based on FAF images by [CONTACT_488649] 
a different statistical approach compared to primary outcome, GA area expansion based on digital 
grading of color fundus images by [CONTACT_488648], changes in BCVA, changes in low 
luminance VA, changes in central retinal thickness on OCT. Measures obtained from qualifying 
fellow eyes (i.e., fellow eyes of participants that also meet eye-specific eligibility criteria) will also 
be analyzed separately and together with study eyes as secondary outcome measures. 
8.3 Exploratory Outcome
The exploratory outcome will compare the difference in the rate of change in macular sensitivity 
as measured using microperimetry. This outcome was originally a secondary outcome when the 
clinical trial participants were enrolled, since these represent visual function data corresponding 
24
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019closely to areas affected by [CONTACT_488636]. Hence, changes in microperimetry data over time 
might be well placed to support changes in structural data over time, as geographic atrophy lesions 
undergo enlargement. In the original Statistical Analysis Plan, the intention was that 
“Macular sensitivity, as measured on microperimetry, will be evaluated in a similar manner as 
BCVA”, (i.e., “Mean rate of change in BCVA during the treatment phase will be compared to the 
mean rate of change in BCVA during the run-in phase using Student’s paired t-test”). 
However, microperimetry data (represented by [CONTACT_488637], one for each anatomical 
location, at each time-point) are much more complex than BCVA data (represented by a single 
numerical value at each time-point). The originally proposed statistical treatment is therefore not 
suitable. In addition, the study team is not aware of any established methods accepted by [CONTACT_488650], unlike the situation for BCVA. Indeed, the 
microperimetry acquisition pattern used in GA MIN is unique and was developed specifically for 
this trial. It therefore needs its own dedicated set of statistical analyses (which may need several 
iterations), rather than pre-specified and widely accepted analyses that could be detailed in advance 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan. For these reasons, although the original intention was for the 
microperimetry data to represent a secondary outcome measure, it is better suited as an exploratory 
outcome measure. 
8.4 Ocular Safety Outcomes
Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated by [CONTACT_488639], ocular surface changes, intraocular 
inflammation and any other ocular changes not consistent with the natural progression of GA.
9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All participants will be followed throughout the duration of the study and included in the analyses.
9.1 Study Design and Primary Analysis
Rate of change in GA, based on digital grading of FAF, will be monitored throughout the study 
period in both the study and fellow eyes. A spline regression model with a fixed knot at Month 9 
will be computed to compare the rates of change in GA from IP start visit to 24 months of treatment 
and from initial study visit to IP start visit in the study eyes of all participants (49). 
Spline regression is a linear modeling method used to assess the longitudinal effects of an 
25
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, [ADDRESS_627717] (49). Splines require at least one break in the study time 
period, a knot. This knot represents a specific point in time that is hypothesized to be the starting 
point of change from the previous, established trend (49), (50).
The spline regression model will compute the slopes for the run-in period and for the treatment 
period. This method will allow for the comparison of the two slopes and will test whether the 
slopes are significantly different (50). A square-root transformation will be used in an attempt to 
satisfy the linear trend assumption of the spline regression model (Box-Cox or logarithm 
transformations may also be attempted if a square-root transformation does not achieve a sufficient 
linear trend). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the rate of change and difference in rates 
will also be calculated–based on the transformed data and back transformed to the rate scale.
9.[ADDRESS_627718] the proposed analyses. These analyses will be 
conducted on all participants enrolled in the study, regardless of compliance, follow-up or 
treatment received. Since the primary outcome is a rate of change, all available FAF data from 
participants who discontinue from the study prior to their Month 9 or 33 study visit will be modeled 
with a longitudinal within-participant linear regression model. This model will determine each 
participant’s annualized rate of progression (i.e., slope of regression line for FAF area over time).
Sensitivity of the data based on the above population to missing observations will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_488651] (MI) analysis and the treatment-received analysis 
based on the Per Protocol (PP) population (without missing observations). In the MI analysis, 
participants’ post-treatment data will be utilized in a longitudinal regression model to estimate 
annualized rate of progression. This analysis assumes that GA progression rates are similar pre 
and post-study withdrawal. In the MI analysis, MI method will be used to generate many different 
annualized progression rates for participants who withdraw early. More specifically, the MI 
procedure will 1) generate multiple imputed datasets (approximately 2,000); 2) perform a t-test for 
each dataset; and 3) finally combine t-values with standard errors that reflect the uncertainty 
26
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-2019inherent in imputation. Under the assumption that the transformation of the rates of change in area 
of GA are normally distributed, the missing rates from the run-in phase and the treatment phase 
will be predicted from each participant’s observed area of GA, and scheduled visits and joint 
relationships with other variables (e.g. participant’s age, visual acuities, OCT measurements).
The final analysis for the longitudinal data throughout the follow-up will treat missing observations 
completely at random (MCAR).
Participants’ compliance with IP administration will be assessed through capsule counts during 
study visits. If study IP compliance falls below 80% of the level prescribed for any participant, the 
participant will be queried about the reasons for decreased compliance and counseled on the 
importance of compliance for study integrity. The level of compliance will be reported to the IRB 
on annual review and taken into account in the analyses of study outcomes. To ensure the study is 
not biased by [CONTACT_488652], statistical analyses will look at the associations between IP 
compliance, dropout, and treatment effect during Months 12, 15, and 21. If IP compliance cannot 
be determined for a participant during any visit, IP compliance will be imputed by [CONTACT_488653].
9.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Any participant who completes three or more visits during the treatment phase will be included in 
these analyses.
VA will be evaluated in both the study and fellow eyes at each scheduled visit, with the secondary 
outcome defined as a three-line worsening in BCVA. A change from initial study visit of 15 letters 
score (three lines) or more, is considered clinically significant. Mean change in BCVA during the 
treatment phase will be compared to the run-in phase.
Development of wet AMD as measured by [CONTACT_488654]. Absolute and relative changes in GA will be assessed using fundus

loss, AEs and treatment failure will also be tabulated.
These analyses will be descriptive and will include tabulations of outcomes over the study period. 
Some nonparametric analyses may be utilized for exploratory analyses of secondary endpoints.
9.4 Sample Size/Accrual Rate
The accrual goal is to enroll [ADDRESS_627719] at an alpha level of 0.05, comparing 
square-root transformed rates of change in GA between 24 months of treatment and the run-in 
phase was employed.
A rate of 1.52 mm2/year is assumed for the run-in phase in the current study, based on the median 
GA expansion rates suggested in the literature (45). For data that are skewed, the square-root of 
the mean is not equal to the mean of the square-root transformed data. However, since a quantile 
of strictly positive data is invariant to transformation (e.g., the square-root of a given quantile of 
the original observations is equal to that quantile of the transformed observations), and for 
symmetric data mean and median are equal, the square-root of the median progression rate 
(√1.52 mm2/year = 1.23 mm/year) is used to approximate the assumed mean progression rate for 
the square-root transformed run-in phase. The treatment phase is assumed to have a 25% reduction 
in the GA growth rate, equivalent to a 13% reduction of the square-root transformed rate, implying 
a mean progression rate of 1.07 mm/year for the square-root transformed GA growth rate during 
the treatment phase. A standard deviation of 0.30 mm/year was obtained from previous NEI GA 
protocols exploratory analyses data and was assumed for the GA growth rate during the run-in 
phase. Given the strictly positive nature of GA enlargement, a reduction in mean progression rate 
during the treatment phase necessitates a smaller standard deviation. However, on the square-root 
scale, the difference in standard deviations between the run-in and treatment phases is negligible 
for the proposed 25% reduction in means, and a standard deviation of 0.30 was also assumed for

90% power to detect a difference in progression rates if the true square-root transformed 
progression rates are 1.23 mm/year during the run-in phase and 1.07 mm/year during the treatment 
phase of 24 months, with an 80% within-in participant correlation. Approximately [ADDRESS_627721] reached their 
Month 9 visit, the study dropout rate will be assessed and a sample size re-estimation may be 
performed.
Sunness, et al. (46), (45) state that a sample size of [ADDRESS_627722] of 
25% when examining the effect of a new systemic treatment on GA growth rate in individuals 
(46). One of the factors that resulted in the reduction of sample size from the Sunness suggestion 
is the use of FAF instead of CFP to grade GA. FAF appears to be more precise (i.e., lower 
within-patient SD) than CFP. For example, the coefficient of variation for the square-root 
transformed FAF data is 2.5, while the coefficient of variation for the CFP data summarized in 
Sunness is 1.3. Further, the current study design utilizes each participant as their own control, 
significantly decreasing within-participant variability and the need for a large sample size.
10.0 HUMAN PARTICIPANTS PROTECTION
10.1 Equitability
Accrual will be equitable for this study. Minimum age of participation was set at 55 years as GA 
in the context AMD does not typi[INVESTIGATOR_488615]; including patients 
< 55 years old will increase the risk of enrolling “masqueraders” (i.e., patients with clinical 
findings similar to GA but arise from a different etiology).

Version Date: August 15, 2022
Template version date 07-29-201910.1.1 Justification for Exclusion of Children
Children will not be eligible for this study, as the condition under study affects primarily adults.
10.1.2 Justification for Exclusion of Pregnant or Lactating Women
Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible for this study because of the known and unknown 
risks of minocycline. One of the known risks of minocycline is that it can cause permanent 
discoloration of the teeth (yellow-grey-brown) of a fetus when given to a pregnant woman during 
the last half of pregnancy. Minocycline also passes into breast milk and can cause permanent 
discoloration of the teeth of a nursing infant. Given the known and unknown effects on pregnancy 
outcomes, two forms of contraception will be required for female participants of childbearing 
potential (see Appendix 1 for definition). In addition, female participants of childbearing potential 
will undergo urine pregnancy tests throughout the study.
10.1.3 Refraction and Visual Acuity
Specific certification in EVA techniques for refraction and visual acuity determinations is required 
for this study. Certification involves a practicum and testing in the competent use of the technique 
and the proper recording of the data. Each person (e.g., physician, optometry professional, 
ophthalmic technician and/or nurse) that performs these determinations on study participants must 
be certified. If necessary, training and certification in the EVA methods can be provided prior to 
study initiation. The Coordinating Center must review and approve any training or certifications 
not conducted by [CONTACT_488655]. Emmes may grandfather existing certifications if candidates are 
currently certified for similar procedures in other NEI studies and have been actively performing 
the EVA refraction and visual acuity testing protocol.

consent, they can take the consent back with them to read it over with a family member or with 
the use of magnifying devices. If the participant chooses, the investigator can also read the consent 
verbatim to the participant and answer any questions that may arise.
An investigator present during the consent process will document the consent process in the 
participant’s medical record. A copy of the signed informed consent form will be provided to the

13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_488617].
31
Abbreviated Title: GA MIN
Version Date: August 15, [ADDRESS_627726] data collection, 
protocol monitoring, data analysis and reporting. The Coordinating Center provides routine 
monitoring of study participants’ data. Monitoring visits will occur on a schedule depending on 
the status of the study. More frequent monitoring visits will be performed at the beginning of the 
study when enrollment is open. Monitoring will decrease as enrollment closes and as participant 
follow-up continues.
Communications between the investigational site and the Coordinating Center will be maintained 
through regular telephone and e-mail contacts between the Coordinating Center Protocol Monitor 
and the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Coordinator. Substantive communications must be maintained both at the 
site and at the Coordinating Center containing the date and a summary of communications where 
instructions are given or received, an interpretation of protocol requirements is made, 
recommendations for corrections to study documentation are made, or where the reporting of 
possible AEs is discussed.
Although the Coordinating Center advises the NEI Clinical Director (CD) and PI [INVESTIGATOR_488618], the Coordinating Center staff does not have direct access to or interaction with 
participants.

(NEI QA program and NEIS standard operating procedures). These procedures cover the full 
protocol cycle beginning with staff credentialing and training, and protocol development and 
approval, through database development, data collection, monitoring and analysis, and finally 
manuscript preparation at the conclusion of the study. Data quality assurance is of the utmost 
importance to the NEI and Emmes. The two groups use a quality assurance system that relies on 
real-time data checks and reports throughout the course of a study to ensure the accuracy of 
information. This system is a secure and confidential data management system that stores data and 
provides quality assurance and reporting. Emmes has developed a number of routine reports 
specifically designed for monitors (e.g., listings of serious adverse events (SAEs), etc.).
Additionally, Emmes has developed summary reports of discrepancies, as well as reports of the 
exceptions databases, which include requests and reasons for exceptions. The results of the reports 
are communicated back to site staff, and, along with protocol compliance issues, to the DSMC 
(if applicable).
Following the monitoring plan for this study, Emmes will perform monitoring activities, including 
on-site audits, review of database entries and the resolution of study issues. Per the monitoring 
plan, the frequency of interim monitoring visits is every six months from enrollment through the 
end of participant follow-up. Site visit frequency modifications may be made to accommodate 
increases or decreases in the quantity of data requiring review and as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_488656], with the minimum site monitoring frequency to occur no less 
than annually. In addition to monitoring, Emmes performs various detailed automated and manual 
data quality checks on an ongoing basis. The results from these checks and any protocol 
compliance issues are communicated back to site staff and to the NEI Project Officer, NEI CD and 
applicable regulatory bodies.

Reportable events will be tracked and submitted to the IRB as outlined in Policy 801.
16.0 ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION
High-dose vitamin supplementation can reduce the progression to exudative AMD (12). 
Participants will be allowed to take AREDS-type vitamin supplements during the course of the 
trial. Currently, there are no other treatments which have been approved for the treatment of GA 
in AMD. Therefore, participants do not forego any known effective treatments and the alternative 
is not to participate in the study. Participants can alternatively receive minocycline outside of the 
study if prescribed off-label by [CONTACT_32368].
17.[ADDRESS_627729] access to the study data. The participants’ names will not appear on any of the data 
forms reported to the Coordinating Center. A unique, coded identifier and study registration 
number will identify the participant if their information is shared with the Coordinating Center for 
research purposes. Participants’ personal information will be kept as private as possible. 
However, records can be inspected by [CONTACT_488657]. 
These include the members of the IRB, the Coordinating Center and the NEI DSMC.

A female participant who is considered non-childbearing due to a medical condition 
(i.e., participant has previously undergone a hysterectomy) does not need a pregnancy test, 
Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) test or contraception.
If a female participant is considered non-childbearing due to menopause, it must be in accordance 
with the NIH OB-GYN guidance on the definition of menopause. This guidance defines 
menopause as:
Women over age [ADDRESS_627732] or contraception.
Women age 55, who have not had a period for one year, should have an FSH test. If their 
FSH level is ≥ 20 mIU/mL, they will be considered menopausal and do not need pregnancy 
testing or contraception. If their FSH level is < 20 mIU/mL, they will need pregnancy 
testing and contraception as required by [CONTACT_760].

DIGITIZED PHOTOGRAPHS
GA will be assessed from the color fundus photographs. GA is observed as one of more sharply 
defined patches of partial or complete depi[INVESTIGATOR_488620] (RPE), 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_488621]. In general at least two of the 
aforementioned characteristics (sharp edges, more or less circular shape and visibility of 
underlying choroidal vessels) are required for a lesion to be classified as GA. Thus, even if much 
of the RPE appears to be preserved and large choroidal vessels cannot be seen, a roundish patch 
of RPE depi[INVESTIGATOR_488622]. The criterion of “edge 
sharpness” may be fulfilled in either of two ways: (1) when the depi[INVESTIGATOR_488623], a “sharp” edge must be abrupt and smooth, like one made with a cookie cutter, or 
(2) when contrast between depi[INVESTIGATOR_312305] a patch and the normal depi[INVESTIGATOR_488624], the edge of the patch may still be considered “sharp” even if the transition occurs 
gradually or irregularly over a zone of [ADDRESS_627737] important criterion and, when present, it is not necessary for 
all the edges of the patch to be sharp (25% of its circumference may be sufficient).
Longitudinal analysis of each patient is performed as a quality control measure in order to ensure 
consistency in borderline decisions regarding the extent of GA.
Once GA has been identified on the FAF by [CONTACT_488659], the grader will manually outline the GA 
lesion(s) using the Doheny Image Reading & Research Lab GRADOR software. All areas of GA 
will be outlined. Then, using the results generation function of the GRADOR, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_488625](s) will be converted to areas, in units of both MPS DA and mm2.

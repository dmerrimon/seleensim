Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacoki netics of ARGX -[ADDRESS_1170971] Generalized Muscle W eakness 
Protocol No:   ARGX-113-1602 
Study site s:  This study will be con ducted in up t o 25 sites. 
Study duration: The study duration for each patient is 13 weeks. It 
consists of a Screening  period of 15 days, a 3 week Treatment period , 
and an 8 week Follow -up (FU) period. Phase: II 
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives: 
• To evaluate the safety an d tolerability of ARGX -113. 
Secondary Objectives : 
• To evaluate the clinical effect  of ARGX -113 using: 
o Myasthenia Gravis -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) score . 
o Quantitative -Myasthenia Gravis score (QMG) . 
o Myasthenia Gravis  Composite  score (MGC). 
• To evaluate the impact of ARGX- 113 on quality of life using 15-item quality of life scale for 
Myasthenia Gravis ( MGQoL15r [revised version] ). 
• To investigate  the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARGX -113. 
• To assess the pharmacodynam ic (PD) markers (e. g., total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and subtypes , 
anti-acetylcholine receptor [ AChR] antibodies ). 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of ARGX -113. 
Methodology:  This is a ra ndomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , multicenter  Phase II study to 
evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ARGX -113 for the treatment of autoimmune 
Myasthenia Gravis (MG) with generalized muscle weakness . 
Approximately 24  patients will be randomized.  
The study will include a Screening period of maximum 15 days, a Treatment period of 3  weeks from 
Visit 1 to Visit 7 and a Follow-Up (FU) period of [ADDRESS_1170972] ( IMP) infusion at Visit 7. 
During the Screening Period , patients’ eligibility will be evaluated for study participation.  
During the Treatment period, eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive ARGX -113 
(10 mg/kg) or placebo in [ADDRESS_1170973] of Care (SoC).  
The total dose per IMP infusion is capped at 1200 mg for patients with b ody weight ≥ 120  kg. 
Patients will receive ARGX -113 or placebo according to the following regimen:  
• Patients will receive ARGX -113 or matching placebo via intravenous (IV) infusion over a 
period of 2 hours on Days 1  (Visit 1), 8±1 (Visit 3), 15±1 (Visit 5), and 22±1 (Visit 7). 
• The Treatment period consists of 7 visits (of which the 3 visits between the weekly dosing 
visits are optional).  
At the end of the 3 weeks Treatment period, the patient will enter  a FU period for 8 weeks. 
During the FU period, 9  visits (of which 1 visit is optional) will take place as detailed in  Table 1. 
Study procedures including e ndpoint assessments will be performed  according to the Schedule of

2016-11-28 Confidential 7 Assessments as detailed in  Table 1. 
In this study, SoC for a patient is the stable dose and administration of their M G treatment prior to 
enrollment. Permitted SoC for MG treatment under this protocol include  azathioprine (AZA), other 
non-steroidal immu nosuppressant drugs (NSIDs: e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide), steroids, as wel l as cholinesterase  inhibitors . Patients 
should be on a stable dose and frequency  of SoC prior to enroll ment as detailed in of Section 5.3.1 
(Criterion 5 ) that should be maintained througho ut the study without any increase or decrease. 
Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors will be required to be on a stable dose for >[ADDRESS_1170974] as recommended by [CONTACT_842574] 
[MGFA]1, prior to performing the MGQoL15r, M G-ADL, QMG, and MGC assessments  at Screening, 
Visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,  10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 . 
During the study, no changes in the dose level and frequency of ARGX -113 or the SoC will be allowed. 
However, if necessary, patients may receive r escue therapy if their MG deteriorates as judged by [CONTACT_842575]15r, MG-ADL, QMG, MGC on any 
study day . 
Rescue the rapy will be determined by [CONTACT_842576] . Rescue 
therapy may include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg ), plasma exchange ( PE), or any other treatment 
chosen by [CONTACT_737] . In case a patient need s rescue therapy according to the treating Investigator, the 
Medical Director at the Sponsor should be informed  in addition to the  Medical Monitor  at the Sponsor’s 
designated contract research organization (CRO, Quintiles) ; where possible prior to actual implementation 
of the rescue therapy. In case rescue therapy is needed (due to deterioration of MG) , patients will be 
discontinued from  treatment with IMP, but will be followed up for safety . Any patient who discontinues 
study treatment due to safety concerns will be followed up for safety and wherever possible for efficacy. 
For patients who  discontinue the study  early, all the procedures listed for Early Discontinuation (ED) visit 
(same procedures as for the End -of-Study [EoS] visit or Visit 16) in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) 
are to be performed (early discontinuati on). This study is exploratory and not powered to a ddress any pre -
defined hypothesi s. The safety and efficacy analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which 
includes all patients who re ceived at least one infusion of ARGX -113 or placebo . 
Planned number of P atients: Approximately 36  patients will be screened in order to randomize 
approximately 24 patients (12  patients per tr eatment arm) to get at least 
[ADDRESS_1170975] 3  doses of IMP  (either ARGX -113 or 
placebo) and who completed at least [ADDRESS_1170976] dose  
(See Appendix 14.6 ). Patients may be replaced in certain circumstances  
(See Section 5.3.6 and Table 2). Final decision for replacement of 
patients will be done on a case -by-case basis in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor  at the Sponsor’s designated contract research 
organization (CRO, Quintiles) and/or the  Medical Director  at the 
Sponsor’s end.

Test product, dose and mode 
of admini stration: In this study, t he Investigational Medicinal Product is ARGX-113 which 
is a human anti -neonatal Fc receptor Ig G1 Fc fragment with immune 
modulating properties. A dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight of 
ARGX-113 will be administered as an  intravenous  (IV) infusion over a 
period of 2 hours at Visits  1, 3, 5, and 7. The total dose per IMP 
infusion is capped at 1200  mg for patients with body weight ≥ 120  kg. 
Placebo, dose, and mode of 
administration:  Matching placebo with same buffer components but without the active 
ingredient will be administered intravenously over a period of 2 hours at 
Visits 1, 3, 5, and 7 . 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary Endpoint: 
• Evaluate the incidence and severity of adver se events (AEs) and serious AEs  (SAEs). 
• Evaluate vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and l aboratory assessments . 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Score change from B aseline (defined as the score  immediately prior to first dose at Visit  1) at 
Visits 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16  for the following:  
o MG-ADL 
o QMG 
o MGC 
o MGQoL15r 
• Maximum reduction from Baseline across  visit days for MG-ADL, QMG, MGC, and MGQoL15 r 
score. 
• Pharmacokinetic  parameters of ARGX -113 including maximum observed concentration (C max), 
time of maximum concentration (t max), concentration prior to dosing (C trough), half-life, (t 1/2,λz), and 
accumulation ratio (R ac). 
• Evaluation  of PD markers: t otal IgG (and subtypes) and anti-AChR antibodies . 
• Evaluate the incidence of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) to ARGX -113. 
• Exploratory  pharmacogenetic assessments in patients who sign a separate pharmacogenetic ICF to 
examine FcRn polymorphisms . 
Statistical methods:  For the primary objective of safety and toler ability, AEs, SAEs, vital signs , ECGs 
and clinical laboratory assessments at specific time points will be evaluated. All safety data will be 
summarized descriptively. Baseline will be the last assessment before the first dose of the I MP. Number 
and percent age of AEs will be pre sented for each treatment by [CONTACT_678465] T erm (PT) and System Organ 
Class (SOC) of the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA)  dictionary. 
Individual listings of a ll serious AEs and discontinuati on from IMP will be summarized usin g the current 
MedDRA dictionary . 
For the secondary objective of clinical effect, the change from B aseline will be eva luated. Actual and 
change in data from B aseline will be summarized descriptively for each treatment by [CONTACT_41995].  For change 
from Baseline, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used for continuous variables; (unless otherwise specified) with the terms of treatment as fixed effects and Baseline value as covariate in the model. All 
tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a two -sided alpha level of 0.05 or with 2- sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). No inferential hypothesi s are tested in these secondary variables and summary 
statistics and CIs for these are not adjusted for multiplicity. The p -value if presented will not be considered 
for any inference. Analysis of Baseline characteristics will be summarized appropriately via descriptive statistics or visual presentation. For analysis of categorical data, Fisher’s exact test, Chi -squared test, or 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel ( CMH) test will be performed.

Myasthenia G ravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized in most cases by T cell 
and antibody responses to neuromuscular junction proteins such as ske letal muscle nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Antibodies against epi[INVESTIGATOR_842552], resulting in the 
characteristic fatigue and weakness associated with this severe disorder. The muscle 
weakness fluctuates with activity, and periods of rest offer only a temporary reprieve .[ADDRESS_1171003] blockade of 
acetylcholine (Ach) binding sites, thereby [CONTACT_842580].4, 5 The disease is typi[INVESTIGATOR_842553]. Acute exacerbations are treated using either 
therapeutic plasma exchange (PE), immunoadsorption (IA) or intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIg). These  therapeutic opti ons, except  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, aim at reducing the 
levels of pathogenic autoantibodies but suffer from severe side effects and/or comorbidities.6 
In order to treat IgG -mediated autoimmunity, it would be beneficial to lower levels of 
pathogenic autoantibodies rapi[INVESTIGATOR_842554] . Antagonizing the neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn) could be a therapeutic approach to achieve this as FcRn is a m ultifunctional molecule 
primarily involved in IgG transport and homeostasis, that influences immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) serum levels and tissue distribution  at all stages of life.7, 8. Following IgG uptake by 
[CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_103009], the Fc part of IgGs binds FcRn with high affinity in early, acidic endosomes 
with pH <6.5. Through its ability to rescue IgG from destruction in the lysosomal 
compartment, FcRn is responsible for the main tenance of high concentrations of IgG in 
circulation and concomitantly for the long half-life of IgG compared to other Ig isotypes. 
Thus, targeting the FcRn-IgG interaction would be a rational therapeutic approach to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_842555]-driven autoimmune diseases such as MG.  
2.[ADDRESS_1171004] 
ARGX-113 is a human IgG1-derived Fc fragment of the za allotype that binds with nanomolar affinity to human FcRn. ARGX-113 encompasses IgG1 residues D220-K447 (EU 
numbering scheme) and has been modified with the so- called ABDEG™ technology

ARGX-113 
2016-11-28 Confidential 26 (ABDEG™ = antibody that enhances IgG degradation )9 to increase its affinity for FcRn at 
both physiological and acidic pH. The increased affinity for FcRn of ARGX-113 at both 
acidic and physiological pH results in a constitutively blockage of FcRn-mediated recycling 
of IgGs. 
Given the essential role of the FcRn receptor in IgG homeostasis, inhibiting this FcRn 
function, as achieved by [CONTACT_486978] -113, leads to rapid degradation of endogenous IgGs, which 
is expected to include autoantibodies in IgG-driven autoimmune diseases. 
This concept has been validated in various murin e disease models together with 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies in cynom olgus monkeys, either by 
[CONTACT_842581]-113 or a full- length mAb analogue (HEL- ABDEG™)10, 11 
In murine in vivo  disease models for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis a clear 
improvement in disease score was observed after treatment with an ABDEG™-equipped 
molecule. This improvement was accompanied  with systemic lowering of autoantibody 
levels. 
Pharmacokinetic and PD  studies in  cynomolgus monkey confirmed the antibody- clearing 
properties of ARGX -113 in a relevant animal model. A single infusion of ARGX-113 
resulted in a decrease of endogenous IgG up to 55% without altering serum albumin 
concentrations as well as IgM or IgA levels. This PD effect was proven to be more potent 
than IVIg, which is considered a standard of care therapy in MG, both in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_842556] . Repeated dosing could improve the PD effect up to a maximum  
IgG reduction of 75%. 
These pre -clinical data validated the further development of ARGX-113 for assessing its 
therapeutic potential in IgG -driven autoimmune indications. 
To this end, a Phase I dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers was initiated. In this study 
ARGX-113 was administered to healthy volunteers in single doses (up to 50 mg/kg) as well 
as multiple doses (up to 25 mg/kg). ARGX -113 was proven to be safe and tolerable in this 
healthy volunteer study a nd pre-clinical PD  parameters could be confirmed in a  human 
setting. 
The proposed Phase II study aims to further establish th e safety, efficacy, PK and PD of 
ARGX-113 in a patient setting, namely in patients with autoimmune MG with generalized 
muscle weakness,  and thereby [CONTACT_842582] a 
therapeutic treatment modality in this indication.

MG. Other non-steroidal immunosuppressive (NS IDs) agents are commonly used and 
include azathioprine  (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and 
rituximab. However, the effectiveness of many of these medications varies widely among 
patients, take a long time to take effect and have numerous adverse consequences.

Plasma exchange (PE) , immunoadsorption and IVIg are used for short- term treatment of MG  
exacerbations and when it is desirable to achieve a rapid clinical response. Plasma exchange temporarily reduces the concentrations of circulating anti- AChR antibodies and in most 
patients produces improvement in a matter of days. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], one exchange removing one to 
two plasma volumes is done every other day up to a total of four to six times, to improve muscle strength or ameliorate a myasthenic crisis. Unfortunately, this treatment is invasive 
and has common side- effects such as hypotension, paresthesia, infections, and thrombotic 
complications. IVIg is widely used for patients with exacerbating MG and data from 
randomized controlled studie s show efficacy similar to  PE. The mechanisms by [CONTACT_842583] e not clear, but two important possibilities are competition with 
autoantibodies (i.e., FcRn binding) and Fc receptor binding. It is important to note that a 
higher degree of auto- antibody reduction, faster onset and better clinical efficacy has been 
observed for PE and immunoadsorption when compared with IVIg. A fast onset is important 
for treatment of patients experiencing exacerbations.

5.1 Summary of Study Design 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter Phase II study to evaluate 
the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ARGX-113 for the treatment  of 
autoimmune MG wit h generalized muscle weakness.  
Approximately 24 patients will be randomized. 
The study will include a Screening period of maximum 15 days, a Treatment period of 
3 weeks from Visit  1 to Visit 7 and a Follow-Up (FU) period of [ADDRESS_1171007] ( IMP) infusion at 
Visit 7. 
During the Screening Period, patients’ eligibility will be evaluated for study participation. 
During the Treatment period, eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 
ARGX-113 (10 mg/kg) or placebo in [ADDRESS_1171008] of Care (S oC). The total dose per IMP infusion is capped at 1200 mg for patients 
with body weight ≥ 120 kg. 
Patients will receive ARGX-113 or placebo according to the following regimen: 
• Patient will receive ARGX -113 or matching placebo via intravenous (IV) infusion 
over a period of 2 hours on Days 1 (Visit 1) , 8±1 (Visit 3) , 15±1 (Visit 5), and 
22±1 (Visit 7). 
• The Treatment period consists of 7 visits (of which the 3 visits between the weekly 
dosing visits are optional). 
At the end of the 3 weeks Treatment period, th e patient will enter a FU period for 8  weeks. 
During the Follow-Up period, 9 visits (of which 1 visit is optional) will take place as detailed in Table 1. 
Study procedures including endpoint assessments will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments as detailed in  Table 1. 
In this study, SoC for a patient is the stable dose and administration of their MG treatment 
prior to enrollment. Permitted SoC for MG treatment under this protocol include azathioprine

as cholinesterase inhibitors. Patients should be on a stable dose and frequency of SoC prior to 
enrollment as detailed in of Section 5.3.1 (Criterion 5) that should be maintained throughout 
the study without any increase or decrease. 
Patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors will be required to be on a stable dose for

11, 12, 14, and 16. 
During the study, no changes in the dose level and frequency of ARGX-[ADDRESS_1171010] udy day. 
Rescue therapy will be determined by [CONTACT_842585] . Rescue therapy may include IVIg, PE, or any other treatment chosen by [CONTACT_3786]. In case a patient needs rescue therapy  according to the tre ating Investigator, the 
Medical Director  at the Sponsor should be informed in addition to the  Medical Monitor  at 
Sponsor’s designated contract research organization (CRO, Quintiles) ; where possible prior 
to actual implementation of the rescue therapy. In case rescue therapy is needed (due to 
deterioration of MG ), patients need to  be discontinued from the treatment, but will be 
followed up for safety. Any patient who discontinues study treat ment due to safety concerns 
will be followed up for safety and wherever possible for efficacy. 
For patients who discontinue the study early , all the procedures listed for the Early 
Discontinuation (ED) visit (same procedures as for the End -of-Study [EoS] v isit or Visit 16 ) 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) are to be performed  (early discontinuation ). This 
study is exploratory and not powered to address any pre-defined hypothesi s. The safety and 
efficacy analysis will be performed on the safety analysis set, which includes all patients who 
received at least one infusion of ARGX-113 or placebo.

Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 prior to administration of IMP. 
Female of childbearing potential are defined as all female participants unless they are 
postmenopausal (defined by [CONTACT_202023]) for a t least 2 years with a 
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) > 40 IU/L  or are surgically sterile (i.e. , who had a 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy , or have current documented tubal ligation or any 
other permanent female sterilization procedure). Determination of FSH levels can be used 
to confirm postmenopausal status in amenorrhe ic patients  not on hormonal replacement 
therapy if the test result is within the postmenopausal range per the central laboratory . 
7. Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method 
of contraception (i.e., pregnancy rate of less than 1% per year) during the study and for 
[ADDRESS_1171017] (IM P). 
Adequate contraceptive methods include combined hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine devices (IUDs), intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), true sexual 
abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant), bilateral tubal occlusion, or a female participant who is not of childbearing potential. 
Female participants and female partners of male study participants using a hormonal 
contraceptive must al so use a barrier method (i.e., condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm 
or cervical/vault caps]) and should have been stable on their hormonal contrac eptive 
treatment for at least [ADDRESS_1171018] be advised not to donate sperm during this period from signing of Informed Consent Form (ICF ), throughout the 
duration of the study, and for [ADDRESS_1171019] use effective method of double barrier contraception (e.g., condom with spermicidal 
cream or jelly, 1 hormonal plus 1 barrier method or 2 simultaneous barrier methods). 
Male patients practicing true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant)  can be included.

well-being, or on the integrity and authenticity of the study data. Information regarding 
definition and classification of protocol deviation is detailed in the Protocol Deviation 
guidance document. 
All deviations from the approved protocol must be documented and notified to the 
Sponsor/Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) at the earliest. The I nvestigator should not 
deviate from the protocol, except for patient safety reasons, in which case the deviation must be reported to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designated CRO (Quintiles) immediately. The Sponsor will not assume any resulting responsibility or liability from  unapproved deviations. The 
Investigator, according to applicable regulations and the Ethics Committee’ s established 
procedures , will inform the Ethics Committee of protocol deviations.  
All instances where the requirements of the study protocol are not complied with, will be 
captured in the eCRF and the study monitor will prepare a Protocol Deviation/Violation Log.

implemented unt il written IRB/IEC approval is obtained, except where necessary to eliminate  
an immediate hazard to study patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects. Protocol deviations/violations and the reason why they occurred will 
be documented in the Clinical study report (CSR). 
5.3.8 Screen Failures and Rescreening  
Evaluations at S creening and confirmation at Visit 1 will be used to determine the eligibility 
of each patient for randomizatio n at Baseline (Visit 1). Patients who fail to  meet the 
eligibility criteria will be co nsidered screen failures.  
Patients may  be rescreened once under the following conditions: 
• Patients who required treatment for an acute illness that resolved (e.g., a urinary tract 
infection) or had stabilization of  a chronic medical problem ( e.g., uncontrolled 
hypertension). 
• Patients who are not on a stable dose of a concomitant medication prior to randomization as per inclusion and exclusion criteria may be re- screened once the 
stable dose criteria is met . 
• Patients with an indeterminate QuantiFERON®- TB Gold test result (for 
tuberculosis).  
The decision to rescreen patients may  be optional based on clinic al state of the patient and 
the decision to rescreen will solely be made based on Sponsor’s discretion on a case -by-case 
basis. 
5.3.9 Early Termination of Study or Site  
The study may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor for safety concerns due to serious 
AEs, inability to achieve the recruitment target within reasonable time or if in the Sponsor's judgement, there are no further benefits to be expected from the study. In such a case, the

Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol- required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the Investigator that may make i t unfeasible to 
perform the assessment . In such cases, the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure 
the safety and well -being of the patient. When a protocol required procedure cannot be 
performed, the Investigator will document the reason and any corrective and preventive 
actions that he/she has taken to ensure that the normal processes are adhered to in source documents. The study team should be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. 
Patients should be seen for all visits on the designated day or as closely as possible to the 
original planned visit schedule. Visits 2, 4, 6 (in the Treatment period) and Visit 8 (in the 
Follow-Up period) are optional. There is a permissible window of ±1  day both for study 
visits in the Treatment period (Visit  1 to Visit 7) and during the FU period ( after Visit 7 to 
Visit 16). Every effort should be made to schedule every visit on the exact Day (which is relative to the Baseline visit) as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). 
The assessments to be performed at each study visit will be conducted  respecting the order of 
assessments as follows:  
At all visits, the efficacy assessments should be performed first, pr ior to any  other study 
specific procedure with the only exception of obtaining informed consent at Screening.

7.6 Selection of Doses in the Study  
Based on the preliminary safety and PK/PD da ta of the aforementioned Phase I  study in 
healthy subjects  (ARGX-113-1501), a weekly dose of 10 mg/kg ARGX-[ADDRESS_1171034] and was considered safe.  
There was a dose- dependent decrease of serum IgG concentrations following a single dose 
administrati on of ARGX-113. T here was a maximum decrease of serum IgG concent rations 
at a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg while a lower dose of 2 mg/kg resulted in less reduction 
of IgG concentrations. Pharmacodynamic data after multiple dosing showed that a dose of 
10 mg/kg either administered every [ADDRESS_1171035] and 
time to reach nadir.  
As a lower drug exposure and a less frequent dose administrations are  considered more 
convenient for patients, the dose regimen of 4 weekly doses of 10  mg/kg was selected for 
investigation in Phase II studies. ARGX-113 was found to be safe and well tolerated 
following administration of four weekly 2 -hour IV 10 mg/kg infusions to healthy subjects. 
It has been reported that reduction of serum IgG concentrations in MG patients following 
short-term treatment with plasma exchange, immunoadsorption or IVIg results in a clinically 
meaningful effect (i.e. , amelioration of sig ns and symptoms )13, 14. 
The impact of reducing serum IgG concentrations with ARGX-[ADDRESS_1171036] was selected for investi gation in this study. Additional doses and dose 
regimens may be considered for future studies.  
During this  study, no changes in the IP dose will be allowed. 
7.7 Timing of Dose  for Each Patient 
ARGX-113 and placebo will be administered intravenously as 4 infusions administered one 
week apart over a period of 2 hours at Visits  1, 3, 5, and 7. Patients will be asked to remain at 
the site for a minimum of 2 hours after the end of infusion as part of routine safety

7.8.1 Emergency Unblinding  
The process for breaking the blind will be handled through the IxRS. Investigators are 
strongly discouraged from requesting the blind to be broken for an individual patient, unless 
there is a patient safety issue that requires unblinding and would change patient management. If possible, Investigators/Sponsor’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_842614]’s designated CRO ( Quintiles) before approaching Ix RS to break the blind. If the 
blind is broken, it may be broken for only the patient in question.

Patients are eligible fo r rescue therapy as judged by [CONTACT_842594]15 r, MG-ADL, QMG, and MGC on any study day. 
Rescue therapy will be determined by [CONTACT_842595], PE, increase in the dose and  frequency of SoC or any 
other treatment chosen by [CONTACT_737]. In this study, ARGX-113 may interfere with the 
efficacy or duration of efficacy of IVIg considering the half- life of IVIg.  Additional details 
about ARGX-113 is present in Section 2.2. 
In case a patient needs rescue therapy according to the treating Investigator, the Medical 
Director at the Sponsor should be informed in a ddition to the  Medical Monitor  at the 
Sponsor’s designated contract research organization (CRO, Quintiles); where possible prior 
to actual implementation of the rescue therapy.  
If rescue therapy is administered, patients need to be discontinued from the study. For 
patients who discontinue the study early, all the procedure s listed for the Early 
Discontinuation (ED) visit (same procedures as for the End -of-Study [EoS] visit or Visit 16 ) 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) are to be performed (early discontinuation visit)

8.1.[ADDRESS_1171043] of the patient. 
Definition of AE : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient 
whether or not a pharmaceutical product is administered and which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or IMP, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product or IM P. 
An AE can also be a new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition). 
Abnormal laboratory values, or test results, physical examination findings, and other 
abnormal investigational findings (i.e., ECG) should not be reported as AEs unless they are 
associated with clinical signs and symptoms that are considered clinically significant, require 
therapy (e.g., hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or he matological stem cell 
support), or lead to treatment disco ntinuation. 
Death is not considered an AE but an outcome. 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IMP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease und er study and/or increase in the symptoms of the disease and should be considered 
as disease progression and not an AE.

2016-11-28 Confidential 63 Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR): Any untoward and unintended response in a subject to an 
IMP which is related to any dose administered to tha t subject. 
Definition of Serious AE (SAE): An SAE, experience or reaction, is any untoward medical 
occurrence (whether considered to be related to I MP or not) that at any dose: 
• Results in death;  
• Is life-threatening (the patient is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128895]/or surgical operations planned b efore a study are not considered SAEs or 
if the illness or disease which caused hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842560], provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. However, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; 
• Other: Medically significant events, which do not meet any of the criteria above, but may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are blood dyscrasias (e.g. neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions t hat do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions and Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
Any suspected adverse reaction that is serious, unexpected, and considered to be related to drug exposure is defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, which is not listed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or intensity that has been observed.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. The following examples provide types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the I MP and the AE: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
System Version: 1.0, Status: Approved, Document ID: VV-TMF-[ZIP_CODE]
argenx  
  
ARGX-113-1602, Version 2.0  
ARGX-113 
2016-11-28 Confidential 64 • One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study  (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group.  
An untoward and unintended post-dosing response to a non-study drug is, by [CONTACT_108], not a 
S[LOCATION_003]R, but is, however, an AE.  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness and causal relation ship to the 
IMP or study procedures. The action taken with the investigational drug and the outcome of 
the event must also be recorded.  
Overdose 
For the purposes of this study, exceeding the dosage requirements specified in this protocol represents an overdose. In case of suspected overdose, the patient should be treated according 
to standard medical practice based on the Investigator’s judgment. 
Severity 
All AEs observed will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The NCI CTCAE is a 
descriptive terminology which can be utilized for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale is 
provided for each AE term. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. If a particular AE’s 
severity is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_43970], the Investigator is to use the general NCI -CTCAE definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_1171044] 
medical judgment. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on the following general guideline: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
interventio n not indicated. 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non- invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).

ARGX-113-1602, Version 2.0

2016-11-28 Confidential 65 • Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living (ADL).  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE. 
Relationship  
The causal relationship between the I MP/study procedures and the AE has to be 
characterized as unrelated, unlikely, related, possible, and probable. 
• Events can be classified as “unrelated” if there is not a reasonable possibility that the 
IMP caused the AE.  
• An “unlikely” relationship s uggests that only a remote connection exists between the 
IMP and the reported AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, progression or 
expression of the disease state, or reaction to concomitant medication, appear to 
explain the reported AE. 
• A “related” relationship suggests that the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of I MP, it follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
IMP, and it cannot reasonable be explained by [CONTACT_350212]’s 
clinical state . 
• A “possible” relationship suggests that the association of the AE with the IMP is 
unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by [CONTACT_145037]. 
• A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with drug administration exists and, in the Investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely 
that a causal relationship exists between the drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of disease state, or 
concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE. 
In final evaluation for reporting the relationship will be converted into “Binary 
Determination” as per CIOMS. Unrelated and Unlikely will be clubbed into “Unrelated” and 
Related, Possible and Probable will be clubbed into “Related” for final reporting purpose.

When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study after signature [CONTACT_86220], whether or not related to the IMP , must be reported immediately (within 
24 hours of the study site’s knowledge of the event) . All SAEs will be recorded (within

SAE report will then be automatically sent by [CONTACT_842597]’s designated CRO (Quintiles) s afety mailbox via the electronic data capture ( EDC) system. In case the EDC 
system is not functioning corre ctly or the system is down, all SAEs should be reported by

The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE to enable the Sponsor (or an authorized r epresentative) to file a report, which satisfies regu latory reporting 
requirements. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs  and to all follow-up reports. 
Criteria for documenting the relationship to IMP as well as severity, outcome, and action 
taken will be the same as those previously described. 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days of a patient 's last visit are to be

[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Any AEs observed from signing the informed consent to the end of the study will be 
followed up to resolution. Resolution means that the patient has returned to a baseline state of 
health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. 
All AEs that occur after the last dose of the I MP should be (pro- actively) followed- up and 
assessed by [CONTACT_368697] (EoS visit or Visit 16 ) or for 30 days after the early 
discontinuation visit (regardless o f discontinuation occurring in T reatment period or FU 
period), and until satisfactory resolution or stabilization.  
Serious AEs will be captured and followed up until resolution (if needed, also after the EoS 
visit). 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days of a pati ent's last dose of I MP 
and/or last visit (EoS visit or Visit 16) are to be collected and reported a s previously 
described (as per Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and will be followed -up regardless of the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_17963] . The Investigator should follow each SAE until the event has resolved to 
the baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_737], until the 
patient is lost to follow -up, or until the patient withdraws consent. If the patient is lost to 
follow-up, the SAE will be categorized based on the Investigator’s last assessment. Every 
effort should be made to follow all SAEs consider ed to be related to I MP or study procedures 
until an outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the SAE page of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. If, after follow -up, return to the baseline status or 
stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF. 
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.

8.2.2 Myasthenia Gravis- Activities of Daily Living  
The MG-ADL is an 8-item patient -reported scale to assess MG symptoms and their effects 
on daily activities. It evaluates the capacity to perform different activities of daily living such 
as talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, brushing the teeth/combing the hair, or arising 
from the chair and it also assesses double vision and eyelid d roop. It is a discrete quantitative 
variable in which the 8 items are rated from 0 to 3 and the total score can point from 0  to 24; 
with higher scores indicating more  impairment. The assessments to be performed using 
MG-ADL does not require any equipment or training. The assessments that will be 
performed using MG-ADL is included in Appendix 14.1. 
8.2.3 Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis  
The QMG quantifies  disease severity based on impairments of body functions and structures 
as defined by [CONTACT_842600].15 
The QMG consists of 13 items that assess ocular, bulbar, and limb function. Out of the 13 
items, 6 are timed tests of endurance measured in seconds. Each item has a possible score 
from 0-3. The total possible score is 39, where higher scores indicate more severe 
impairments.  It is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups to assess limb 
function. It requires minimal equip ment such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_842563], nose clips, stopwatch, cups and water for swallowing tests, goniometer,

ordinal scale with [ADDRESS_1171058] gaze, double vision, eye closure, neck flexion, shoulder 
abduction, and hip flexion. The patient reported outcomes under MGC are talking, chewing, swallowing, and breathing. The maximum possible score is 50, with higher scores reflecting 
more severe impairments.  The items that will be tested is included in Appendix 14.3. 
8.2.5 15-Item Quality of Life Scale for Myasthenia Gravis 
The 15-item Quality of Life scale for Myasthenia Gravis (MGQoL15r) is a quality of life 
scale or survey of patient’s responses and addresses MG -specific psychological well -being 
and social functioning. It is a brief questionnaire that is to be completed by [CONTACT_842601] 3 response options. The MGQoL15r is helpful in informing the clinician about the 
patient’s perception of the extent of and dissatisfaction with MG -related dysfunction.  Each 
item is scored from [ADDRESS_1171059] non-compartmental and/or compartmental methods, as appropriate. 
The appropriate PK parameters will be  calculated after single ( Visit 1) and multiple

Blood sample to assess A DA will be collected pre -dose at Visits 1, 5, and 7. Subsequently 
ADA will be  assessed at Visits 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 during the Follow-up period. 
8.7 Pharmacogenetic s 
This study includes an optional Pharmacogenetic assessment which requires signature [CONTACT_4007] a 
separate informed consent if the patient agrees to participate. It is required as part of this 
protocol that the Investigator presents  this option to the patient. As this is an optional 
assessment, if the patient refuses consent he/she will not be excluded from the study . In this 
study, pharmacogenetic analysis will not be used for making regulatory judgments pertaining 
to the safety or efficacy of the I MP. 
However, these data may be considered for voluntary submission, consistent with applicable 
regulatory guidance on this topic, in order to develop the knowledge base necessary t o 
establish the validity of new genomic biomarkers.  
If patients consent for this optional assessment, a blood sample will be collected prior to first 
dosing on (Visit 1) and will be stored for pharmacogenetic analysis (limited to the assessment 
of FcRn polymorphisms). In case the blood draw at Baseline is missed, the sample should be 
taken at Visit  3 prior to the administration of IMP. 
Blood samples taken for this pharmacogenetic analysis will be stored for up to 15 years at 
Quintiles Q2 lab during which the assessment of FcRn polymorphisms may be done on the 
DNA derived from the samples, and these will not be used for additional gene analysis.

Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the SOPs of the Data 
Management and B iostatistics dep artments of the Sponsor’s designated CRO ( Quintiles). 
Data for this study will be recorded via InForm 5.[ADDRESS_1171060] observations 
on the patients participating in the study. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible during or after the patien t’s visit. To avoid inter-observer variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and safety e valuations. The Investigator must verify 
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct . 
As a matter of regulation, the Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered onto eCRFs. The Investigator should also ensure that 
patient submits completed and correct questionnaires. Prior to submission, each completed 
eCRF must be reviewed for accuracy by [CONTACT_737], corrected as necessary and then 
approved. The Investigator’s e-signature [CONTACT_748904] [CONTACT_748899]. The Investigator will be required to electronically sign off on the eCRF and SAE data. 
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluat e them for completeness and consistency . The 
eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections and alterations are to be made by [CONTACT_842604]/her designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. 
Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the 
data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_218817], together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of 
the site staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in 
advance. If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data Manager will 
raise a query in the EDC application . The appropriate study site staff will answer queries sent

used by [CONTACT_192162][INVESTIGATOR_842564] t’s medical  history, that ve rify the 
existence of the patien t, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and  all records covering the 
patient’s participation in the study . They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, patient files, etc. The eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_71339] a qualified designee from the site as soon as the data are available. Instructions for the completion of eCRFs will be provided. 
The eCRFs will be considered complete when all missing, incorrect and /or inconsistent data 
have been accounted for. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not 
available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF 
using appropriate item or form level comments.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_216590]. The Investigator must 
submit a completed eCRF for each patien t who receives IMP, regardless of duration. All 
supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
should be clearly identified with the study and patient number. Any personal information, 
including patient name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.

The Investigator will provide the Sponsor or designee with documentation of IRB/IEC 
approval of the protocol and informed consent documents before the study may begin at the 
study sites. The Investigator will supply documentation to the Sponsor or designee of the 
required IRB/IEC’s annual renewal of the protocol, and any approvals of revisions to the informed consent document or amendments to the protocol. 
The Investigator will report promptly to the IRB/IEC, any new information that may 
adversely affect the safety of patients or the conduct of the study. Similarly, the Investigator will submit written summaries of the study st atus to the IRB/IEC annually, or more 
frequently if requested by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC. Upon completion of the study, the Investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if required. 
11.[ADDRESS_1171067] of the Study  
This study will  be conducted and the informed consent will be obtained according to the 
ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki (2008), the applicable guidelines for GCP, or the applicable drug and data protection laws and regulations of the countries where the study will be conducted. 
11.3 Patient Information and Informed Consent 
The informed consent form ( ICF) will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study 
participation to the patient in simple terms be fore the patient is enro lled into the study. A 
separate ICF will be given in case a patient consents for Pharmacogenetic analysis and for 
Pregnancy in case of a female partner of male patient. The ICF contains a statement that the 
consent is freely given, that the patient is aware of the risks and benefits of entering the 
study, and that the patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time . Written consent 
must be given by [CONTACT_17491]/or legal representative, after the receipt of detailed 
information on the study. 
All ICFs must be available in  the local and vernacular languages required at the site and 
include patient information sheets/brochures that outline the study procedures. All ICF(s) 
must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_76409] a legally acceptable representative.  
For patients who are una ble to read and write, the patient information sheet and ICF(s)

ARGX-113 
2016-11-28 Confidential 86 should be read to the patient in his/her native language in the presence of an impartial witness 
who is literate and not affiliated with the study. The patient having understood the 
information given to him/her in the presence of an impartial witness will thumbprint the 
ICF(s) and the same will be countersigned by [CONTACT_386635]. If the patient or legally 
acceptable representative cannot read, then an impartial witness will witness and  attest the 
entire consent process and will be required to sign the consent form. 
Confirmation of a patient’s informed consent must also be documented in the patient’s 
medical record prior to any testing under this protocol, including Screening tests and  
assessments.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed cons ent is obtained from each 
patient or legal representative and for obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the 
informed consent document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to 
the administration of IMP. The Investigator will provide each patient with a copy of the 
signed and dated consent form. 
11.4 Patient Data P rotection  
The ICF will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislation. 
Sponsor or representative will not provide individual genotype results to patients, any 
insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician, or any other 
third party, unless required to do so by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked 
to the identity of the patient. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals 
might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patien t. For example, in the 
case of a medical emergency, a Sponsor or representative physician or an Investigator might 
know a patient’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files.

I. DOUBLE VISION: 
Patients' preparation: Patient is sitting. Ask if the patient is experiencing  double vision looking strai ght ahead. If ye s, record 0/3 
(actual time/grade) on the scoring sheet. If no, ask the patient  to look to the right for just an instant and then to the left without moving 
their head. If the patient sees double in only one direction,  record side and record result as 0/3. If there  is no eye movement,  record as 
0/3. If the patient does not see double, or sees double in  both directions,  have them perform the test as described b elow gazing to the 
right. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to face forward. When I ask, look over to your right (left) side without  turning your head. If or 
when you start  to see double, please let me know." 
 
Notes to examiner: Patient's head will usually start to turn in the direction of the gaze. Try to maintain the head in a forward position. 
Record the time and grade. Example: double vision is evident at [ADDRESS_1171082] 15/1. 
 
 
 
II. PTOSIS (upward gaze): 
Patients' preparation: Patient is sitting. Ask the patient to look straight ahead. If the upper lid is touching the pupil, record as 
0/3. Ask the patient to look up at the ceiling without moving the head. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need you to face forward. When I ask,  look up at the ceiling without moving your head. Keep looking up 
until I tell you to relax." 
 
Notes to examiner: Patient's head will usually start to move up. Try to maintain the head in a forward position. Record time and grade 
when you see either eyelid (lashes) start to droop. Ex: Right eyelid starts to droop at [ADDRESS_1171083] 9/2. If neither eyelid touches the 
pupil, record 60/0.

Patient's p reparation: The patient needs to be sitting in a chair with both feet on the floor. They must be seated without leaning 
against the back of a chair. Test both arms at the same time. Arms need to be out to the side at 90o, palms down. (Demonstrate  this 
position).  If the patient cannot raise an arm out to 
90o due to a shoulder problem, do not test that arm. The elbows are ex tended through full mechanical ran ge. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I need for you to hold both arms out to the side like this. Keep the arms out as long as possible.  If one arm 
tires more than the other, y ou may lower that arm and keep the other arm  up." 
 
Notes to examiner: It is not uncommon that the arms start to droop. If the arms drop more than 10o from starting position, remind the 
patient to pull the arms up. If the patient can pull the arms up but cannot maintain  that position for longer than two seconds, stop the 
test. If one arm is lowered, be careful that the patient does not start to lean to the side that the arm was lowered  to give the appearance 
that he/she is maintaining a 90o angle. Record time/grade (ex: 45 sec for right arm is 45/2; whereas 100 sec for left arm is 100/1). 
 
 
 
VII: FORCED VITAL CAPACITY: 
Patient preparation: Patients must remain seated for this test. 
 
Explanation to patient: "I am te sting total lung capacity. I am going to ask you to hold this mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_842567]. I will then 
place the nose-clips on your nose. I will tell you to take a deep b reath in, and then place the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_842568] y our mouth. You will blow 
out as hard and as fast as you can. Keep blowing until I tell you to stop. 
Notes to examiner: We are only testing FVC. A minimum  of three trials and a max imum of five trials will be performed. The  goal is 
to get the best two trials within 5% of each other. Give a lot of encoura gement. Record best FVC (liters and percentage) and grade 
on sheet, (ex: 2.55 - 60% /  2). 
 
The “normal” FVC values, and therefore the percent  predicted calculations  can vary with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_842569]. Some 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_842570]. That  is why the same spi[INVESTIGATOR_842571] u sed each time you test a subject. 
For multi-site studies, parameters and norm al  values should be decided so that all sites are using the same information.

Explanation to patient: "I need for you to lift your head off of the table. Keep it up as long as possible." 
 
Notes to examiner: Place your hand under their head (without touching) to  provide some  cushion if the head drops back. The head 
should come up and forward, not just up to the ceiling. If the head drops within 10o of neutral,  stop the test.

Assuming MG -ADL scores as a key indicator for efficacy. To detect the difference of 4 
points between MG- ADL scores of Active and Placebo with variability (1) SD=1.80 for 
active and SD=3.72 for placebo, a sample size of 10 subjects per group would be 
sufficient to achieve 80% power. Approximately 36 patients will be screened in order to 
randomize approximately 24 patients (12 patients per treatment arm) to get at least [ADDRESS_1171087] 3 doses of IMP (either ARGX -113 or placebo) and who 
completed at least [ADDRESS_1171088] in  designing future 
studies.

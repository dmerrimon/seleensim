Clinical phase II
Trial rationale Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), who inadequatel y 
respond to first line treatment, will receive augmentation treatment. 
However, there remains significant unmet medical need in those 
patients who either do not respond to or do not tolerate current 
augmentation approaches (e.g., at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], lithium) and 
for whom last line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ECT and ketamine) are either not 
available or unsuitable. A product that would show similar efficacy  
to the above mentioned augmentation treatments, but without the 
side effects and/or resource requirements would constitute a major 
medical advance.
Only  quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_879992] (SSRI ; 
SNRI ; bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]), and has therefore been included as an additional 
treatment arm in this Phase II trial.

Statistical methods To demonstrate proof of concept and to evaluate the dose response 
relationship for BI 1358894, a multiple comparison procedure with 
modelling techniques (MCPMod) approach is planned for the 
primary  anal ysisof the BI 1358894 and placebo treatment arms. As 
a basis for the MCPMod anal ysis and to assess quantitative 
treatment benefit, a mixed model for r epeated measure (MMRM) 
analysis will be used to generate covariate adjusted estimates of 
mean change from baseline to Week 6 in MADRS total score and 
associated covariance matrices. No formal hy pothesis testing will be 
performed to compare the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_879998] 1358894 arms or the

* End of treatment (EOT) for participant s who complete the treatment period at Visit 8.
** Participants who discontinue trial drug prematurely must perform a nearly EOT visit within 7 days and should ideally be observed until trial end as if they were still receiving blinded trial 
treatment, e.g., follow the regular visit schedu le after the early EOT visit . In addition, all early D/C participant s must also complete the FUP visit ( early drug discontinuation date + 28+ 2 
days) for a full trial safety follow -up. There are 2 options for observing participant s after premature drug discontinuation ( refer to section 3.3.4 for additional information ).

The main objectives of this trial are to provide proof of concept (Po C), assess dose -ranging 
data of BI [ADDRESS_1229733] size.
The trial will be performed to characterize the dose- response curve for BI 1358894 in 
participant s with MDD by  [CONTACT_58833] 4 doses and placebo. The response is the change from 
baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6 summarized per arm by  [CONTACT_790912]. The 
multiple comparison procedure with modelling (MCPMod) approach will be used to 
characterize the dose -response curve.
The primary  characterization will be on treatme nt which will assume all participants took 
randomized treatment for the duration of the trial.
Assessments of secondary  and further efficacy  and safet y parameters will further support the 
selection of a dose (range).

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This is a randomize d double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -design trial with an additional 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_880001]. This design is appropriate for providing proof -of-concept/dose
range finding and assessing the safet y and efficacy of BI [ADDRESS_1229736] anti -
depressive treatment (including ongoing stable psy chother apy, where applicable) and the 
duration of the placebo treatm
ent will be limited to [ADDRESS_1229737] -in-Class c ompound with a new therapeutic concept and mode of 
action, inclusion of an approved medication arm for the targeted population (i.e. quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ) 
is planned in this trial for reference. Descriptive comparisons between the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_880002] t of placebo response in this trial. No 
formal h ypothesis testing will be performed to compare BI [ADDRESS_1229738]  the generalized MCPMod 
approach has been implemented as the statistical design. This approach is widely  accepted 
[R15 -1961] , [R19-1647] and is able to incorporate potential relationships between the 
different doses into the evaluations via optimal test contrasts and uses the available data 
better than the commonly  applied pairwise comparisons.
A total of four active BI -doses will be admi nistered to provide reasonable coverage for most 
monotonic shapes. A sufficiently  broad set of candidate shapes for the dose -response 
relationship has also been chosen. In addition, an unequal allocation ratio (3.5:1:1:1:2) has 
been selected for the treatm
ent and placebo groups. In general, a n allocation of a higher 
proportion of 
participant s to the placebo and active dose of interest versus other treatment 
arms will lead to better precision which then leads to a higher power. In addition, increasing 
the pr oportion of participants in the placebo group compared to other treatment arms may  
lead to the observation of a greater separation between the placebo and active treatment

3.3.4 Withdrawal of participant s from treatment or assessments
Every  effort should be made to keep the participant s in the trial: if possible on treatment, or at 
least to collect importan t trial data. Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful 
participant selection, appropriate explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to 
trial enrolment, as well as the explanation of the options for earl y discontinuation in c ase of 
withdrawals (see section 6.2.2).
Participant s may  discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a 
whole (“withdrawal of consent”) with very  different imp lications; please see sections below.
If a participant discontinues trial treatment prior to the completion of protocol -specified end 
of treatment (E OT) visit , every  effort should be made by  [CONTACT_880019] s to remain in the 
trial if medicall y safe. Participant s who discontinue trial drug 
prematurel y should ideally be observed until the end of the trial (week 10) as if they  were still 
receiving blinded trialtreatment. Participant s should complete the early  End of Treatment
(
eEOT) procedures as described in the Flow Charts and Section 6.2.2. If a participant refuses 
to return for all further visits after early  treatment discontinuation, the participant should be 
encouraged to complete at least the w eek 6 visit as scheduled and a FUP visit 28+ 2 day s after 
date of trial drug discontinuation. If FUP visit (e arly drug discontinuation + 28+ 2 days) can 
be completed prior to the date of the planned Visit [ADDRESS_1229750] full y withdrawn consent to 
participate in the trial. In this case, the participant does not need to justify  the decision and 
should be withdrawn from the trialand all fo llow-up assessments.
Withdrawal from the trial of an individual participant may be considered also in case of 
administrative reasons, such as but not limited to multiple important protocol violations and
persistent non -compliance .No participant should be withdrawn from the trial before 
discussion with CTL .
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual participant will discontinue trial treatment if:
The participant wants to discontinue trial treatment, without the need to justify  the 
decision.
The participant has repeatedly  shown to be non -
compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or 
able to adhere to the tr ial requirements in the future.
The participant needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the 
investigational medicinal product or other trial treatment; refer to the ISF .
The participant undergoes an ECT or TMS .
Participant receives Ketamine /S -Ketamine treatment during 
the course of the trial .

surgery , adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy), per investigator’s clinical 
judgement. In case of a temporary  reason, trial treatment sho uld be restarted if medically  
justified.
Pregnancy  occurs during the trial . (Once a participant has been enrolled in the clinical 
trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report an y drug exposure during 
pregnancy  which occurred in a fema le trial participant to the Sponsor immediatel y (within 
24 hours) b y means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the Sponsor’s unique 
entry  point).
The participant must discontinue treatment with trial medication if: 
oThe participant develops suici dal ideation of ty pe 4 or 5 in the C -SSRS (i.e., 
active suicidal thought with intent but without specific plan, active suicidal 
thought with plan and intent) or suicidal behaviour (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted 
attempt, aborted attempt or preparatory  acts or behavior) .
oIn the event of worsening of MDD which requires medical treatment which is on 
the list of restricted medications (refer to ISF), the trial drug has to be 
discontinued.
In addition to these criteria, the phy sician may  discontinue treatment at any time based on his 
or her clinical judgment. For all participant s the reason for withdrawal from trial treatment 
(e.g. AEs) must be recorded in the CRF. These data will be included in the trial database and 
reported.
If new efficacy /safet y information becomes available, Boehringer Ingelheim will review the
benefit -risk- assessment and, if ne eded, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all 
participant s or take an y other appropriate action to ensure the safet y of the tria l participant s.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of consent to trial participation
Participant s may  withdraw their consent to trial participation at any  time without the need to 
justify  the decision. If a participant wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be 
involve d in the discussion with the participant and explain the difference between trial 
treatment discontinuation and withdrawal of consent to trial participation, as well as explain 
the options for continued follow -up after trial treatment discontinuation, plea se see section
[IP_ADDRESS] above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of the trial by  [CONTACT_880020], or at a particular trial 
site at any  time for the following reasons:
1.Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site.
2.Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invalidating the earlier positive benefit -
risk-assessment that could significantl y affect the continuation of the trial.
3.Deviations from GCP, the trial protocol, or the contract impairing the appropriate conduct 
of the trial.
Further follow up of participant s affected will occur as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].

given to the participant . The duration of treatment is [ADDRESS_1229754] dose of trial 
medication should be taken on the day  before the EOT Visit.
At Visit 2, after randomization, participant s will receive medication kits for the double -blind 
treatment period. The morning dose of trial medication will be taken at the trialsite under 
supervision of the investigator or site staff. Participant s will bring trial medication 
(used/unused blister and covering packages) to site visits for compliance check 
(V3/V4/V6/V8). At visits V2, V4 and V6, participant s will return used/unus ed medication 
kits and receive new supplies for a total of 14 treatment day s (14 treatment day s plus 3days 
reserve) for BI 1358894 and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .
Participant s should be instructed not to take their trial medication in the morning of Visit 4 
and Visit 6, as participant s will be dosed at the site . 
Participant s 
should also be instructed not to take their trial medica tion in the morning of 
Visit 8/EOT/ eEOT Visit, as a  at that visit. For participant s 
who complete the treatment period, the last dose of trial medication should be taken on the 
day before the 
EOT Visit. Participant s who fail to do so should have the visit rescheduled as 
soon as possible, ideally  on the following day .
Participant s should be instructed to take the BI [ADDRESS_1229755] , i.e.,either with or without food every  morning at 
approximately  the same time . If a morning dose is missed by  [CONTACT_726] 12 hours, that dose 
should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. On day s prior to a visit, 
the morning dose should be taken approximately  24 hours before the planned morning dose at 
the clinic visit. A dose reduction of BI 1358894 is not possible.

*In this protocol, ESR testing is used solely for the collection of data for anal ysis purpose at the end of the trial, per FDA’s 
recommendation. The ESR Testing results are not intended to be used as Safety Parameter or for medical management 
decisions. For medical management decisions of Safety relevant inflammation parameter, the CRP test should be used.
For assessment of the kidney  function, the formula of the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(EGFR) CDK -EPI (Chronic Kidney  Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8849]) and EGFR CKD-

details in the I SF.
5.3.4 Electrocardiogram
The 12
-lead ECGs will be performed as scheduled in the Flow Chart 1. Twelve -lead ECGs (I, 
II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 – V6) will be recorded using equi pment provided by  a central 
ECG vendor. The ECGs will be recorded for at least 10- second duration after the participant s 
have rested for at least 5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_35921]. Electrode 
placement will be performed according to t he method of Einthoven/Goldberger (ankles and 
wrists). At all time points indicated in the Flow Chart , single ECGs will be recorded. ECG 
recordings at planned time points may  be repeated for quality  reasons like alternating current 
artefacts, muscle movements and electrode dislocation. I n this case the repeated ECG 
recordings will be used if quality  was better.
The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and 
whether it is clinically  significant, if abnormal. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded 
as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the participant ’s medical file if 
there is no validated and certified e -medical record for ECG data.
Additional ECGs may  be c ollected b y the investigator for safet y reasons. Clinically  relevant 
findings noticed at baseline assessment (Visit 1) should be reported as baseline condition.

All ECGs will be transmitted electronically  to the central ECG vendor in order to enable a 
centralized and independent re- evaluation of all 12 -lead ECGs. A centralized and 
independent re -evaluation will be done. Abnormalities detected during this centralized ECG 
evaluation will not necessarily  qualify  as AE.

5.3.5 O ther safety parameters
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Suicidality
Suicidal risk assessed b y the C -SSRS (clinician interview version eq uivalent to the paper -
version, shall be administered electronically  via a tablet/rater station) :
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured, investigator -rated interview, developed by  [CONTACT_342349], assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. I t does 
not give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity  information 
specificall y for behavior and ideation.
The C -SSRS interview may  be administered by  [CONTACT_342350], psy chologist, clinical 
social worke r, mental health counsellor, nurse, or coordinator with C- SSRS training. It has a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_417801], and causes onl y a low burden on participants. At a 
minimum, the interview consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation and 4 
related to suicidal behaviour, and may  be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive 
responses. Freetext entries are allowed for; the investigator has to directl y evaluate the scale 
and write a report.
The C -SSRS has been widely  used in large multi national clinical trials. The C- SSRS will be 
administered first at screening (Visit 1) (using the ‘Baseline / Screening’ version) with the 
aim to exclude participant swith active moderate or severe s ymptomatology within a 
specified time prior to screening. The lifetime history  of suicidal ideation and behavior will 
also be recorded.
After screening (Visit 1) the assessment ‘since last visit’ will be performed at each clinic visit 
(‘Since Last Visit version’). The investigator is to review/consider the C -SSRS results for 
plausibility  and clinical relevance. Doubtful reports may be repe ated or reports may be 
validated b y a consulting psychiatrist. If there is a confirmed positive report of suicidal 
behavior or suicidal ideation ty pe 4 or 5 after start of trial, the investigator is to immediately  
interview the participant during the clinic visit (if the investigator did not administer the C-
SSRS leading to the positive report), and/ or is to consult a psy chiatrist if considered 
necessary . If the positive report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the participant ’s safet y 
have to be initi ated.
All C -SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type [ADDRESS_1229769] 
be reported as separate SAEs by  [CONTACT_093].

reports, that get coded to terms like suicidal depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal threat or
similar, are on the “Alway s serious AE L ist”and therefore must be reported as SAEs (refer to 
section [IP_ADDRESS].3).
For ‘Self -injurious behaviour, no suicidal intent’ standard AE / SAE repor ting rules are to be 
applied.
5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1229772] a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  are 
judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
Regarding AEs in the context of suicidal risk assessment by C -
SSRS, section 5.3 .5.1should be 
adhered.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfil ls at least one of the 
following criteria :
results in death,
is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have caused 
death if more severe,
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574] ,
results in persistent or signif icant d isability  or incapacity ,
is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,

appropriate medical judge ment which may  jeopard isethe participant and may  require 
medical or surgica l intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15575].
For Japan only : the following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any  other 
reason”. AE swhich possibly  lead to disability  will be reported as SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described 
in5.3.6.2, subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
Suici dal ideation terms are also part of the Always Serious AElist.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1229774] (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see 
section 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.
The foll owing are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]:
an elevation of AST (A spartate Aminotransferase ) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥
3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2- fold 
ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, or

abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the 
ISF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) wit hout lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in th e DILI checklist should be followed .
No other AESIs have been defined for this trial.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient 
discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1229777] that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The ev ent is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-existing
or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i .e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks of

concerned) .
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_698780], taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
Additional ar guments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1229779] be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  [CONTACT_1275] :
From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual participant ’send of stud y
(the End of stud y(EoStudy ) visit) : 
all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
After the individual participant ’s end of stud y: 
the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the participant for new AEs but should 
only report an y occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment 
related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_15625], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see 
section [IP_ADDRESS].2), but not on the CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1229780] report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately  (within 24 hours) to the sponsor’s 
unique entry point (country  specific reporting process wi ll be provided in the I SF). The same 
timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available.
In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This 
does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual partici pant’s end of stud y
must be followed up until they  have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or 
no further information can be obtained.

In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a participant has been enrolled in 
the clinical trialand has taken trialmedication, the investigator must report any  drug 
exposure during pregnancy  in a trialparticipant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  [CONTACT_444136] A of the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form to the 
sponsor ’s unique entr y point.
Similarly , potential drug exposure during pregnancy  must be reported if a partner ofa male 
trialparticipant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.
Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial 
specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up 
and reported to the s ponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Studies (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part A and B) .
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, i n the absence of an accompany ing SAE

Chart 2. Each visit date (with its window) is to be counted from Day 1. If any  visit has to be 
rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule. Additional visits 
for the purpose of re -testing of laboratory  parameters or AE monitoring may  be included as 
deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093].
During the COVID -19 pandemic, there might be situations when participant s might not be 
able to come to the site for the scheduled visit. This might be e.g. due to restrictions set by  
[CONTACT_15628]/institution, because the partic ipant is quarantined, or 
because of an y participant- specific situation that the investi gator judges as being not safe for 
the participant to come to the site.
For details on potential modifications of the trial conduct related to the COVID -[ADDRESS_1229786] of the neurops ychological assessments need to be 
followed:
The site staff must be properly  trained on all trial procedures and training documentation 
filed in the I SF.
Qualification, training, remediation (if needed) and central reading of the scales will be 
provided b y a specialized vendor. The training standards and sta ndards for the conduct of 
the assessments will be defined for each assessment individually  and can be found in the 
ISF; it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_880012].
At the screening visit, all clinical assessments (Flowchart 1) should be performed first, 
followed b y the clinical outcome measurements (scale assessments - Flow Chart 2). After 
the screening visit, the scales should be performed first ( Flow Chart 2 ), followed b y the 
other clinical examinations ( Flow Chart 1). All scales should be completed in the order a s 
noted in the Flow Chart 2, top to down.
Each assessment of the site -rater administered scales ( MADRS , CGI -S) should preferentially  
be done b y the same members of the site staff for a given participant throughout the trial
period. However, the rater who performs the C-SSRS and/or AEs should not also perform the 
MADRS and CGI -S for the same patient to prevent bias .
Results of the MADRS assessments at screening are 
part of the eligibility  evaluation 
(seebelow).

Participant s prematurely  discontinuing trial drug
Participant s who discontinue tr ialdrug prematurely  should ideall y be observed until trialend 
as if they  were still receiving blinded trialtreatment. If this is not possible, then participant s 
should be encouraged to come back to the site and complete week 6 visit procedures, with the 
performance of the MADRS scale as a minimum requirement . See section Flow Charts and 
3.3.4 .forfurther options.
Withdrawal of consent
If a participant is not will ing to continue in the trial until to the end of the trial, Visit 8 should 
be scheduled and completed instead of the next scheduled visit as soon as possible. Also the 
EoStudy visit should be performed to assess and monitor safety . If the participant refus es to 
participate at an EOT Visit and withdraws consent for an y reason (without the need to justify  
the decision), the trial completion page of the eCRF has to be filled in. All unused trial 
medication will be collected and trial drug diary  will be checked by  [CONTACT_779]. If participant
discontinues prematurel y for safety reasons or withdraws consent, trial medication
administration and  will not be performed at EOT Visit (please refer to secti on

SAMPLE SIZ E
The primary  trial objective of this Phase II trial includes demonstration of proof of concept of 
the clinical activity  of BI [ADDRESS_1229792] to a non- flat dose response curve, 
characterization of the dose- response relationship within the therapeutic range, and selection 
of the dose range for phase III development. For this purpose, the primary  anal ysis uses 
methodology  for dose finding employ ing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling 
techniques (MCPMod) to anal yse 4 doses of BI 1358894 and placebo [R10 -1424] .In 
addition, the benefit of BI 1358894 compare d to placebo will be evaluated.
As a basis for the MCPMod anal ysis, a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) analy sis 
will be used to generate covariate adjusted estimates of mean change from baseline to Week 
[ADDRESS_1229793] suitable doses for confirmatory testing in future studies.
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The null hy pothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve comparing placebo and the BI 
1358894 dose groups. The alternative h ypothesis is that there is a non -flat dose response

category  will be presented for categorical data.
Analy sis sets defined for this trial include the full anal ysis set (FAS) and the treated set (TS). 
The FAS comprises all randomized participant s who received at least one dose of trial 
medication during the trial and had a baseline observation recorded . Unless otherwise 
specified, efficacy  analy ses will be performed on the FAS and will be based on assigned 
treatment. Full specifications for the FAS will be provided in the TSAP.
Safety  anal yses will be conducted on the TS, which incl

have received at least one dose of the trial medication. Safety  anal yses will be conducted 
using actual treatment received. Data from participants who were screened but not 
randomized will be listed but not included in any  summaries or inferential statistics.
Important protocol deviations (iPDs) will be collected throughout the trial conduct and will 
be summarized in the CTR as defined in the iPD specification document.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint 
analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint
As defined in s ection 2.1.2, the primary  endpoint is the change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1229796] dose of trial medication plus 7days (3 times 
the estimated elimination half- life). Any  data collected after a participant discontinues trial
drug, regardless of reason, will be censored and will not be included in the primary  anal ysis.

on healthy  volunteer data to cover a plausible and diverse range of dose response patterns for 
the trial medication. Associated graphs of each model are shown in Figure 7.2.2 .1: 1.
Emax1: 50% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25mg; corresponding to the 
assumed true ED50 = 25 mg.
Emax2: 70% of the maximum effect is achieved at 5mg; corresponding to a 
drug effect achieved mainly  with low doses, ED50 = 2.14 mg .
Sigmax: 50% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25 mg, and
 90% of the maximum effect is achieved at 75 mg; corresponding to a 
more flexible model of the assumed true ED50 = 25 mg.

CRF sfor individual participant s will be provided by  [CONTACT_103] .See section [IP_ADDRESS] .for
rules about emergency  code breaks. For drug accountability , refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialparticipant . Source data as well as 
reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Electronic records, i.e. clinician administered assessment data, related audio recordings (for 
central review) and patient reported outcome data entered into the tablet computer (Rater 
Station) w ill be regarded as source data. These may  be further anal ysed by [CONTACT_880026] r.
The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will 
be stored in the participant
’s medical file.
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The current medical history  of the participant may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for 
the trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evide nce of 
any diagnostic tests. In this case ,the investigator should make up to three documented 
attempt to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history  from the 
participant , documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.
Ifthe participant is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training 
must be documented in the participant file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Participant identification : gender, yearof birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations )
Participant participation in the trial(substance, 
trial number, participant number, date 
participant was informed)
Dates of participant’s visits, including dispensing of trialmedication
Medical history  (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
Medication history

participating in this trial. Tasks and responsibilities aredefined in a contract.
Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators and sub -investigators 
(e.g. their curricula vitae) will be filed in the I SF. The investigators will have access to the BI 
clinical trial portal  to facilitate document exchan ge and maintain electronic ISF.
BI has appointed a Clinical Trial Leader (CT Leader ), responsible for coordinating all 
required activities, in order to
manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal SOPs,
direct the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct, and reporting of the trial,
ensure appropriate training and information of Clinical Trial Managers (CT Managers ), 
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs), and investigators of participating countries.
The organisation of the trialin the participatin g countries will be performed by  [CONTACT_15639] -organisation (Operating Unit, OPU) in accordance with applicable 
regulations and BISOPs, or delegated to a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) with 
which the responsibilities and tasks will have been agreed and a written contract filed before 
initiation of the clinical trial.
If applicable, in addition to the Protocol, approved and effective local protocol amendment(s) 
should be followed b y investigators.
Data Management and Statistical Evaluation will be done by  [CONTACT_15640].
Tasks and functions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial are defined 
according to BI SOPs. A list of responsible persons and relevant local information can be 
found i n the I SF.
A DMC will be established. Members of the DMC are independent of BI, they  are ph ysicians 
experienced in the treatment of the disease under investigation and a statistician.
The main focus of the DMC will be the evaluation of safet y data. Effic acy data may  be 
reviewed if requested b y the DMC to support the risk/benefit assessment. The DMC will 
receive urgent significant safet y concerns including severe infections, suicidality  reports and 
DILI, for immediate evaluation. While DMC members may  be u nblinded, measures are in 
place to ensure the blinding for every one else involved in the trial conduct. Regular DMC 
meetings will be held at specified intervals. The DMC will recommend continuation, 
modification or termination of the trial as detailed in t he DMC charter. DMC 
recommendations as well as the final BI decision will be reported to the appropriate 
Regulatory  Authorities (RAs)/Health Authorities (HAs), IRBs/ECs, and to investigators as 
requested b y local law. The tasks and responsibilities of the DMC are specified in a charter.

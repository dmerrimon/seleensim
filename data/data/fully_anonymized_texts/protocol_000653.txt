PROTOCOL OVERVIEW  (ABSTRACT)  1-[ADDRESS_68758] OF CARVEDILOL ON EXERCISE PERFORMANCE IN FONTAN PATIENTS  
 
OVERVIEW (ABSTRACT)  
Until the late 20th century patients with a diagnosis of a functional single ventricle (SV)  
circulation was uniformly fatal.  The development of staged surgical palliation including 
the initial neonatal procedure, Glenn shunt, and modified Fontan procedure, has 
dramatically improved survival.1-3  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_63755], these patients still suf fer from lower quality of life, decreased exercise capacity, 
poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes, need for heart transplantation and other co -
morbidities.4-12  Although patients with SV circulation comprise a small portion of all 
congenital heart disease, 2-4% of congenital heart disease, they require a great deal of 
resource utilization.4,13-[ADDRESS_68759] deleterious effects on myocardial function, and 
blocking of this process reduces mortality in patients with biventricular heart failure. A 
multicenter randomized trial of carvedilol vers us placebo in pediatric heart failure 
patients with multiple different etiologies including some with SV failed to show an 
improvement in the primary endpoint of improved functional state.18  However, a smaller 
non-blinded study indicated improvement in ventricular function in Fontan patients with 
carvedilol.19  Therefore, it is reasonable to h ypothesize that beta blockers will imp rove 
functional status in Fontan patients . Carvedilol has α1  in addition to β1, β2, receptor –
blocking properties making this agent the preferred beta -blocker in patients with 
 
 [ADDRESS_68760] (RER>1.0 at maximal exercise)  
and safety laboratories . Participants who are able to exercise as described and who 
have acceptable safety laboratories will be randomly assigned to receive either 
carvedilol or placebo for the first [ADDRESS_68761] of carvedilol therapy to that of placebo 
therapy on exercise performance as measured by [CONTACT_63774].  Secondary endpoints include the following: peak heart rate during exercise, 
submaximal exercise capacity, ventilatory efficiency of carbon dioxide , and safety profile 
of carvedilol in Fontan patients .  The total sample size t arget of [ADDRESS_68762] practice in 
developed nations for patients with a functional single ventricle  (SV) circulation to 
undergo a three -stage surgical palliation.  Survival to stage III palliation, the Fontan 
procedure, has greatly improved in recent decades.[ADDRESS_68763] tool for predicting poorer cardiovascular 
outcomes in heart failure, including patients with Fontan circulation. The specific aims of 
this research are as follows.  
 
Primary Aim 1: To compare the effect of carve dilol to that of placebo on peak exercise 
capacity.  
Rationale: Peak exercise capacity is directly related to cardiovascular health and has 
been shown to be predictive of outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease.  
Primary and Secondary Measures: Peak volume of oxygen consumption indexed to 
patient weight (peak VO 2) is the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures will 
include maximum watts performed, respi[INVESTIGATOR_63756].  
Hypothesis: Carvedilol will increase peak exercise ca pacity.  
 
Secondary Aim 1: To compare the effect of carvedilol to that of placebo on 
chronotropy.  
Rationale: Beta-blockers are sometimes avoided in Fontan patients because of a 
theoretical concern of worsening chronotropic incompetence.  However, this has n ever 
been studied systematically.  
 
 4 Measures: Primary outcome measure is peak heart rate during exercise. Secondary 
measures will be heart rate reserve (heart rate at peak exercise minus baseline heart 
rate) and chronotropy reserve (peak heart rate minus bas eline heart rate divided by [CONTACT_63775]).  
Hypothesis: Carvedilol will decrease peak heart rate  
 
Secondary Aim 2: To compare the effect of carvedilol to that of placebo on 
submaximal exercise capacity  
Rationale: Submaximal exercise capacity is directly related to cardiovascular health and 
has been shown to be prognostic of outcomes in cardiovascular disease.  
Measures: Primary outcome measure will be the volume of oxygen consumption at 
anaerobic threshold indexed to patient weight. Secondary measures will include watts 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_63757].  
Hypothesis : Carvedilol will increase volume of oxygen consumption at anaerobic 
threshold.  
 
Secondary Aim 3: To compare the effect of carvedilol to that of placebo on ventilatory 
efficiency of carbon dioxide.  
Rationale: The ventilatory efficiency of carbon dioxide has prognostic value in patients 
with heart failure.  
Measures: Primary measures will be ventilatory equivalent of c arbon dioxide at 
anaerobic threshold (VE/VCO 2 at anaerobic threshold). Secondary measure will be 
slope of minute ventilation to volume of carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO 2 slope).  
Hypothesis: Carvedilol will improve ventricular mechanics and therefore de crease 
ventilatory efficiency of carbon dioxide.  
 
Secondary Aim 4 : To evaluate the safety of carvedilol in Fontan patients over an 
intermediate time period.  
Rationale : Limited data are available regarding the safety profile of carvedilol in the 
Fontan popu lation has not been previously described.  
 
 5 Measures : Laboratory data and t he number of serious adverse events and adverse 
events reported during the two different treatment periods (carvedilol v. placebo) .  
Hypothesis : Carvedilol will have a similar side ef fect profile compared to placebo.  
 
 
 
  
 
 [ADDRESS_68764] stage of pal liation ( modified Fontan  procedure ) typi[INVESTIGATOR_63758] [ADDRESS_68765] 
the patient. Fontan patients often develop ventricular dysfunction leading to heart failure 
symptoms and heart transplantation.  Heart transplantation is a possible therapeutic 
option, however, patients with previous single ventricle palliatio n are at higher risk for 
complications (death, rejection and infection) after transplantation than patients with a 
biventricular circulation.9  Even without important signs or symptoms of hear t failure, 
Fontan patients’ quality of life is lower than their peers, evidenced by [CONTACT_63776] 
 
 [ADDRESS_68766] deleterious effects on myocardial function, and 
blocking of this process reduces mortality in patients with biventricular heart fa ilure. A 
multicenter randomized trial of carvedilol versus placebo in pediatric heart failure 
patients with multiple different etiologies including some with SV failed to show an 
improvement in the primary endpoint of improved functional state.18  However, a smaller 
non-blinded study indicated improvement in ventricular function in Fontan patients with 
carvedilol.19  Therefore, it reasonable to hypothesize that beta blockers will improve 
functional status in Fontan patients.  Carvedilol has α1  in addition to β1, β2, receptor –
blocking properties making this agent the preferred beta -blocker in patients with 
increased systemic vascular  resistance.  Systemic vascular resistance is increased in 
 
 [ADDRESS_68767] udy by [CONTACT_63777]. showed that carvedilol 
pharmacokinetics in adolescents was similar to that of adults.30.  Ishibashi and 
colleagues described using carvedilol in patients with SV with an a ge range of 1 month 
to 35 years (mean 10 years).  The average maximum dose of carvedilol was 0.42mg/kg 
± 0.29.  In this study, only one patient out of [ADDRESS_68768] been shown to 
be effective in other patient populations. Furthermore, we are only beginning to 
appreciate t he "new" natural history of Fontan patients who are now surviving into 
young adulthood.  There is emerging knowledge that these patients show a chronic 
inability to provide adequate preload the systemic ventricle, significantly lowered 
maximal heart rates and chronically elevated systemic vascular resistance, combined 
with elevated levels of catecholamines and activation of the renin -angiotensin system.  
Therefore, this study aims to systematically study the effects of a commonly available 
and often used me dication in patients with Fontan physiology.   
 
 [ADDRESS_68769]. In a recent study, 
the ventilatory efficiency of carbon dioxide was associated with unscheduled 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63759].38 
 
B.3.5 Safety Profile of carvedilol  
Carvedilol is a commonly used medication in heart failure.  Due to efficacy studies in 
different populations, cardiologists often use carvedilol in the Fontan population.  
However, there is a lack of data regarding the safety  profile of carvedilol specific  to the 
Fontan population.  Adverse events will be recorded.  While hepatic and renal 
dysfunction are rare adverse events (<1%) of carvedilol, they are of severe 
consequence in the Fontan population.  Possible hepatic or renal dysfunction 
associated with c arvedilol in Fontan patients has not been previously described. 
Therefore a comprehensive metabolic panel will be monitored throughout the study.  
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a seromarker of heart failure that is associated with 
important outcomes in the Fontan population.  Therefore, BNP will be measured during  
the study to assess the effect carvedilol has on serum BNP in Fontan patients.   
 
B.[ADDRESS_68770] ivity as 
well.  In adult heart failure trials it has been proven superior to other form of beta -
blockers in preventing mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Given it’s superiority in treating 
heart failure, carvedilol was chosen as the beta blocker for this stu dy.   
 
 
B.5 Rationale for Screening Laboratories  
 
 11 B.5.1 B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)   
BNP is a seromarker made in response to ventricular or atrial myocardial stretch.  It is a 
well-studied seromarker shown to be associated with heart failure in multiple different 
populations. Decreases in BNP have been associated with improved outcomes in the 
SV population.40 A BNP >300p g/mL has been associated with a significant increase in 
chances of needing heart transplant, heart failure admission or death .44 BNP will be 
used in the screening phase to determine eligibility for randomization  as outlined  below . 
 
B.5.2 Complete Blood Count (CBC)   
CBC will be obtained to measure hematocrit and hemoglobin.  Significant anemia 
(hemoglobin  <7gm/dL) or polycythemia ( hemoglobin  >18gm/dL) affect s oxygen 
consumption during the exercise test. Therefore significantly abnormal hemoglobin 
(>18gm/d L or <7gm/dL) will introduce  significant bias in the results.  Therefore, , anemia 
(hemoglobin <7gm/dL) and polycythemia (hemoglobin >18gm/dL)  is an exclusion 
criteria as later outlined reduce confounding factors in comparisons of oxygen 
consumptions.  
 
B.5.3 Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)  
CMP will give the study investigators valuable information.  Serum albumin will be used 
to assess if patients meet exclusion criteria #17 (serum albumin <2.0 g/dL).  AST/ALT 
will be used to assess for the presence of h epatic dysfunction as described in exclusion 
criteria #8.  Serum creatinine will be used to assess for renal dysfunction  (creatinine 
>2.0mg/dL) as later outlined, and is an exclusion criteria (# 7).

4) Significant anemia or polycythemia defined as hemoglobin >18gm/dL  or 
hemoglobin <7 gm/dL  
5) Severely elevated serum BNP defined as  BNP>300pg/ml  
  
C.2.1. e  Subject Availability   
The estimated number of patients who meet trial eligibility criteria is approximately 150.  
Fontan patients are seen on an annual basis.  Therefore, assuming a consent rate of 
20%, the required 30 subjects can be enrolled within the two year timeframe.   
 
C.3. Recruitment and Eligibility Phase s 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_63762]’s Medical Center and the study 
coordinator will be responsible for case finding and subject recruitment.  
 
For patients who meet inclusion criteria for the eligibilit y phase , the patient’s cardiologist 
will be approached.  Then potential study participant s (if over 18 years of age) or the 
parent(s) or legal guardian of potential participants, will be approached about 
participation. At this time, a final determination a bout eligibility for the screening phase 
 
 [ADDRESS_68775] experienced in the treatment of patients with Fontan circulation will be 
involved in obtaining consent.  Data (demographic, eligibility criteria and informed 
consent status) will be recorded on a screening form for all patients with Fontan 
circulation, regardless of their inclusion in the study, for definition of the study 
population.  The screening  data will be obtained and stored in a confidential manner, in 
compliance with HIPAA requirements and local national regulations.   
 
Each subject enrolled in the trial will be assigned a study identification (ID) number so 
that study information will be co nfidential.  The link between subject name [CONTACT_63792]’s 
Medical Center and will only be accessible to the PI, study investigators and research 
coordinators.  Data that will be o btained on study participants includes demographic 
data and family history, information about their past and current medical care, 
echocardiographic imaging data, and information on adverse drug reactions and 
adverse events.  The stress test data will be i nterpreted at Children’s Medical Center by 
a study investigator and will contain the patient’s name.  The consent form will state this 
clearly.  All study procedures are conducted in accordance with local and HIPAA 
requirements and regulations.  
 
C.3.1. Gender and Minority Inclusion  
Based on current rosters of patients with Fontan circulation at Children’s Medical Center 
of Dallas, it is estimated that 50% of patients will be female and 15 -35% of the patients 
will be of minority race/ethnicity.  Race, gen der and other patient characteristics will not 
be considered when targeting enrollment.  
 
C.[ADDRESS_68776] and safety laboratories will be performed. If the study 
participant meets inclusion criteria for the treatment phase (RE R>1.[ADDRESS_68777]) and does not meet exclusion criteria for the treatment phase (serum 
albumin <2.0 g/dL, hemoglobin <7gm/dL or hemoglobin >18gm/dL, AST and/or ALT > 3 
times upper limit of normal, BNP>300pg/ml, or serum creatinine greater than 2.0mg/dL ) 
s/he enter th e treatment phase of the study within [ADDRESS_68778]’s treatment group assignment.  
Randomization to treatment arm (carvedilol first versus placebo first) will be determined 
by [CONTACT_63779]’s Medical Center investigational drug pharmacy.  
 
No one else including subjects, their families, and primary care providers will be 
informed of the subject’s treatment assignment.     
 
The Data Safety and Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will determine their preference for 
receipt of blinded or unblinded trial results prior to the interim look.  No clinical 
investigators will review trial outcomes, by [CONTACT_63780], until the end of the trial.  
 
C.5.2  Randomization  
After eligibility h as been confirmed as described above in C.2.1. a-d and the trial consent 
has been signed, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_68779] be 
confirmed, a nd written informed consent obtained, before randomization.  
Randomization will be accomplished by [CONTACT_63779]’s Medical Center of Dallas 
Investigation Drug Pharmacy.  
 
C.5.3  Study Drugs  
C.5.3.1  Uptitration Period  
 
 18 After the baseline clinical evaluation, all subjects will be entered into the uptitration 
period, during which they will receive carvedilol or placebo in addition to their usual 
medications.  The goal of the uptitration period is to reach the effective dos e (defined 
below) that will then be continued throughout the maintenance phase.  Based upon the 
subject’s body weight, the pharmacist will determine the appropriate initial dose of 
carvedilol.  Starting doses and the up -titration are shown in Table 1.  Dos e ranges are 
provided but actual doses will be rounded up or down according to the available pi[INVESTIGATOR_63763] (3.125mg increments). Each drug will be administered twice a day, at about the 
same time of day.

C.5.3.2. Down -titration of Study Drug  
During the washout period, after treatment period  2 (Table 5) or i f it is necessary for a 
subject to stop the study drug, the subject should optimally be weaned off the drug as 
follows . Per manufacturer’s guidelines, carvedilol will be down -titrated over one week : 
 
Day 1:   50% of previous dose  
Day 3-5: 25 % of regular dose  
Day 7-10: Stop drug  
 
In the event of severe clinical instability or inability to take the study drug (i.e., severe 
vomiting), weaning may need to occur over a shorter period of time, at the discretion of 
the study physician and care pro viders. Reinitiation of study drug will be considered 
 
 19 after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_63764] (or legal guardians) and attending 
cardiologist.  
 
C.5.3.3  Protocol Deviations in Treatment  
All deviations from the above schedules will be noted and described on a study report 
form.  In addition, for all non -study drugs, the dosage, treatment period, and reason for 
use will be recorded.  For modified and interrupted therapy, the length of and reason for 
the modification/interruption will be record ed.  Every attempt will be made to keep 
protocol deviations and non -protocol treatment to a minimum.  
 
C.5.3.4  Dispensing of Study Drug and Compliance Monitoring  
All study drugs (placebo and carvedilol) will be dispensed through the investigational 
drug ph armacy at Children’s Medical Center of Dallas.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_63765]:  The family will receive a medication bottle.  Study drug in the form of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_63766] 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and [ADDRESS_68780] has developed an adverse reaction, 
further monitoring will be performed as clinically indicated.  
 
 
 20 C.5.4  Indications for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
● Intolerance to study drug  
● Continued administration of study drug felt to be not indicated by [CONTACT_63781]  
● Pregnancy or planned pregnancy  
● Other adverse events that require discontinuation of study drug in the judgment 
of the study investigator  
The reason and the circumstances for permanent discontinuation of study drug will be 
documented.  If study drug is permanently discontinued, the subject will continue to be 
followed and undergo expected tests and measurements through the planned 
completion d ate (31 weeks after randomization), unless an indication for withdrawal 
from trial is met.  
 
C.5.5  Indications for Withdrawal from the Trial  
● Subject/guardian refusal to continue in the trial, including refusal of the 
subject to sign the adult informed cons ent form upon reaching the age of 
consent  
● Subject failure to return for scheduled appointments  
The reason for withdrawal and the circumstances of withdrawal will be documented for 
all subjects withdrawn from the study.

 21 C.6. Potential Risks, Benefits , Adverse Events  and Pro tections  
C.6.1. Potential Risks  
The possible risks or discomforts to the subjects include those listed below.  
1. Treatment with carvedilol may rarely induce adverse drug reactions including 
symptomatic bradycardia, dizziness, postural hypotension, fatigue, lethargy, 
mental depression, headache, nausea, diarrhea, sleep disturbances, and 
asthma exacerbation.  
3. Self-limited exercise tests pose very small risks of syncope, arrhythmias, 
hypotension, emesis, dizziness, leg or other muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
4. Risks associated with drawing blood from a vein include momentary 
discomfort and/or bruising.  Infection, excess bleeding, clotting, and fainting 
are also possible, although unlikely.  Less than 5 ml of blood is needed for the 
3 safety laboratories (CBC, CMP, and BMP).  
5. Study investigators from UT Southwestern and Children’s Health will have 
access to the medical record for [ADDRESS_68783] Risks  
Protection of study subjects is implicit in all studies at UT Southwestern and Children’s 
Medical Center of Dallas, and is achieved through sound study design, patient 
education, strict adherence to informed consent principle s, careful monitoring of 
subjects, and compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practices, including HIPAA regulations or local national laws and regulations.  
 
C.6.2.a  Informed Consent   
Consent will be obtained from t he parent(s) or legal guardian and consent or assent, as 
applicable, will be obtained from the subject.  This will be facilitated by [CONTACT_1744] -approved 
study brochures, and information about the trial that will be placed on the clinical trials 
Web site, www.clin icaltrials.gov.  The site study investigators, study coordinators, or 
assigned designees will obtain consents, documented by [CONTACT_423], parent(s) or legal 
 
 22 guardian’s witnessed signature [CONTACT_63793].  The potential study 
participant will be informed of possible adverse effects from carvedilol  some of which 
are transient , including: fatigue (20%), bradycardia (9%), hypotension (9%), syncope 
(3%), dizzine ss (6%), chest pain (2%), nausea (9%),  vomiting (6%),  cough (8%), 
insomnia (3%), headache (8%) . If potential subjects or parents decline to participate, 
their or their child’s medical care will not be adversely affected in any way.  If they agree 
to partic ipate, they are free to withdraw from the study at any time.  Additionally, 
subjects who reach the age of consent during their participation in the trial will be re -
consented with the adult informed consent form.   
 
C.6.2.b  Protection Against Risks  
To min imize the potential risks listed in Section C. 6.1 the following steps will be taken:  
1. The starting doses of carvedilol will be low and will be up -titrated carefully (see 
Table 1).  
2. Subjects with known renal dysfunction will be excluded from the study.  
3. Blood draws, to the extent possible, will be performed after the application of a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_63767].   
4. Serum creatinine, BNP, hemoglobin, hematocrit, AST and ALT will be measured 
as during the screening phase . Serum creatinine,  BNP,  AST and ALT will  be 
measured during the treatment phase (Table 5).   
5. Pregnancy or a planned pregnancy during the trial are exclusion criteria. A urine 
pregnancy test will be obtained during the screening phase.  A statement 
regarding the potential risk of one of the study  drugs will be given to female 
subjects of child -bearing potential and to the parents of female subjects less than 
[ADDRESS_68784]’s sexual activity.  
In addition, this risk is listed in the consent and the assent.  Written 
documentation of birth control measures will be required for female subjects who 
are sexually active.  
6. The study sponsor will pay for all testing that is not part of routine care.  
 
 
 [ADDRESS_68785] are:  
1. The subject’s family, primary care provider, and cardiologist will receive extensive 
information regarding the subject’s cardiac status.  
 
C.6.4  Risk/Benefit Ratio  
The risk/benefit  ratio of the study is favorable.  The risk of adverse drug reactions is low, 
and most are relatively minor in nature and reversible with a decrease in the dose of 
study drug or cessation of therapy. There is a small risk of privacy being compromised 
in this study.  Subject identities will be coded to insure confidentiality and all data will be 
stored and communicated according to the code  to protect against loss of privacy . 
There will be some unavoidable inconvenience to subjects and families because of 
study visits and blood draws.  However, subjects and families will be compensated 
within the limits of the study budget and local IRB guidelines for travel and related 
expenses for study visits.  All study costs not related to standard clinical care will be 
paid for. Given the anticipated benefits to subjects and others with the Fontan 
circulation, the risks are reasonable.  
 
C.6.5  Importance of Knowledge to be Gained  
Current data are very limited to support or refute the utility of carvedilol in this 
population. The variable practices in the use of carvedilol in management of SV patients 
underscore the need for further research. Data collected in the proposed study wil l 
provide important information regarding safety profile, as well as efficacy data crucial to 
the development of multicenter trials of carvedilol in Fontan patients.  
 
C.6.6  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Throughout the performance of this study and durin g the performance of all procedures, 
subjects will be carefully monitored in accordance with current medical practices. 
Treatment with carvedilol as proposed in this study has had few if any reported side 
effects.   Based upon the extensive experience with  all aspects of the study protocol 
procedures, it is anticipated that that the risk of adverse events associated with the 
 
 24 study will be acceptably low and therefore will be monitored by [CONTACT_978], the DSMB (see 
below), and the IRB. Maximum efforts will be und ertaken to ensure the safety of all 
study participants. All personnel involved in performance of the study and its procedures 
will be fully trained and extensively experienced. All serious adverse events will be 
required to be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_68786] the 
reporting process.  
 
Seriousness  
 
 25 A serious adverse event is one that:  
(a) Results in death,  
(b) Is life -threatening (the subject was, in the view of the Principal Investigator, in 
immediate danger of death from the event  as it occurred),  
(c) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
(d) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
(e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant.  
 
The Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ) provides a grading system that is used to categorize the severity 
of adverse events, as follows:  
(a) Grade 1  Mild:  transient, requires no special treatment or intervention, does not 
interfere with daily activities  
(b) Grade 2  Moderate:  alleviated with simple treatments, may limit daily activities  
(c) Grade 3  Severe:  requires therapeutic intervention and interrupts daily activit ies 
(d) Grade 4  Life-threatening or disabling  
(e) Grade 5  Death.  
A serious adverse event, as defined above, encompasses CTCAE grades 4 and 5, and 
any Grade 3 event that requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or that is disabling.   
 
Expectedness  
The purpos e of reporting is to provide new, important information on serious reactions 
or events previously unobserved or undocumented.  Therefore, all adverse events will 
be evaluated as to whether their occurrence was unexpected.  
1.  Unexpected:  An unexpected ad verse event or adverse drug reaction is one for 
which the nature or severity is not consistent with information in the protocol, consent 
form, or product brochure.   
2.  Expected:  An event is considered expected if it is known to be associated with the 
study drugs.  For this protocol, expected events include the following:  
a. Bradycardia  
b. Dizziness  
 
 [ADDRESS_68787] pain  
aa. Renal dysfunction  
bb. Anemia  
cc. Hepatic dysfunction  
 
Causality  
 
 27 Causality assessment is required in clinical investigations to help determine which 
events require expedited reporting.  The following criteria will be used to determine 
causality:  
1.  Not Related:  The event is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s 
clinical state, or non -study drugs or interventions.  
2.  Possibly Related:  The event follows a compatible temporal sequence from the time 
of administration of the study drug, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_63783]’s clinical state or non -study drugs or interventions.  
3.  Probably Rel ated:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time 
of drug administration, and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, or non -study drugs or interventions.  
 
C.6.6.c Identification of and Data  Collection Procedures for Adverse Events  
In this trial, a primary safety concern as well as one of the secondary end points is to 
capture and compare adverse drug reactions between carvedilol versus placebo .  In 
addition, following standard clinical trial  procedures, information on other adverse 
events will be collected.   
 
Adverse drug reactions  will be assessed at baseline, at the end of up -titration, and at 
each study visit through a standardized questionnaire that will be administered by [CONTACT_63784]. The assessment at baseline will be obtained while 
the subject is not taking any study drug and is essential to accurate assessment of drug 
effects.  Adverse event s that are not considered adverse drug reactions will be identified  
when they are reported to the clinical center or during scheduled study visits by [CONTACT_63785].  Subjects and families will be encouraged to report any 
serious event to study personnel as soon as the event occurs, rather than waiti ng for 
scheduled visits.   
 
C.6.6.d  Reporting Procedures (Table 2) 
1.  Fatal or life -threatening adverse events are to be reported to the IRB within three 
working days after knowledge of the event.  Those that are unexpected and considered 
 
 [ADDRESS_68788] knowledge of the event, followed by a 
complete report within 15 calendar days.  All other fatal or life threatening e vents will be 
reported to the DSMB within 15 days,  
 
2.  All other serious (i.e., non -fatal or not life -threatening) adverse events that are 
unexpected and considered possibly or probably related to the study drug will be 
reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_68789] knowledge of the event.   
 
3.  All other adverse events not meeting the criteria for expedited reporting will be 
reported quarterly to the DSMB.   
 
4.  The following events do NOT need to be reported:   
● Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29128] -cardiovascular surgical, diagnostic, or other 
procedures.  
● Planned cardiac catheterization.  
● Social admissions in the setting of foster care or other similar circumstances.  
● Otitis media  
● Streptococcal pharyngitis  
● Allergic rhinitis  
● Uncomplicated upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]  
● Short -term (<36 hours) fever with no other symptoms after immunizations  
● Uncomplicated gastroenteritis  
● Uncomplicated urinary tract infections  
● Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63768], including broken bones, 
evaluation after motor vehicle accident, or similar incident.  
The site investigator or designee will report all serious adverse events to the IRB 
according to IRB policies.  
  
 
 [ADDRESS_68790]  
After each DSMB meeting, a Summary Report of Adverse Events will be prepared and 
submitted at the continuing review to the IRB.  The Summary Report will contain the 
following information:  
● A statement that a DSMB review of outcome data, adverse events, and 
information relating to study performa nce took place on a given date  
● A statement as to whether or not the frequency of adverse events exceeded what 
was expected and indicated in the informed consent  
● A statement that a review of recent literature relevant to the research took place  
● The DSMB’s r ecommendation with respect to progress or need for modification of 
the protocol or informed consent.  If the DSMB recommends changes to the 
protocols or informed consent, the rationale for such changes and any relevant 
data will be provided  
● A statement tha t if safety concerns are identified, the NHLBI Program Official will 
communicate these promptly to the investigators.   
 
C.6.6.f  Post -Study Procedures for Adverse Events  
All adverse events unresolved at the time of the subject's termination from the study will 
be followed by [CONTACT_63786], the subject is lost to 
follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained or has stabilized.  At the last 
scheduled contact, the investigator will instruct each subject or parent/guardian to report 
any subsequent event(s) occurring in the next [ADDRESS_68791]'s personal physician believes might reasonably be related to  the study drugs.  
 
 [ADDRESS_68792] has discontinued study drug or 
terminated study participation will be reported.

C.7.2. Windows for measurements  
To ensure adequate time for patients obtaining maximum tolerated dose of carvedilol 
prior to visit 6 and visit 12 exercise testing, visits 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10 and will occur as 
outlined ± 7 days.  Visit 5 and 11 will occur as outlined  ± 14 days.  Visit 6 and visit 12 
will occur as outlined ± 14 days.  
 
 
 
 32 C.7.3. Exercise Testing  
All Exercise Tests for study purposes will be performed at the Children’s Medical Center 
of Dallas.  Studies will be performed by [CONTACT_63787].  An attending cardiolgist will be immediately available per 
institutional protocol for any adverse event experienced during the exercise test.  The 
exercise test will provide peak oxygen consumption, peak heart rate, venti latory 
efficiency of carbon dioxide as well as submaximal exercise test performance.  As 
previously described these data are associated with outcomes in the SV population and 
therefore were chosen as the primary and secondary endpoints.  Exercise tests wil l be 
performed on Visit 1,  6,  7, and 12.  
 
C.7.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include heart rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry. Vital signs will be 
obtained by a pediatric research coordinator or appropriate designee. As previously 
described, bradycardia and hypotension are possible adverse events of treatment with 
carvedilol.  
Bradycardia will be defined as : 
1. Heart rate that is less than two standard deviations below age normal that 
is associated with at least one  of the following : 
1. New symptoms of syncope, pre -syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness or 
nausea  
2. Hypotension  
3. Heart block (2nd or 3rd degree)  
4. New symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
5. Development of any new symptom that is deemed to be due to 
bradycardia by a study investigator  
 
Hypotension will be defined as:  
1. For patients < 18 year s of age, systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure less     
than [ADDRESS_68796] deviations from the age/sex/height normal values43; for 
patients 18 years of age or older a systolic blood pressure of less than 
 
 33 85mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of less than 55 mmHg; and is 
associated with at least one  of the following:  
1. Syncope, pre -syncope, dizziness, lightheadness or nausea  
2. Newly developed bradycardia  
3. Heart block  
4. New symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
5. Development of any new symptom that is deemed to be due to 
hypotension by a study investigator  
 
Response to Bradycardia or Hypoten sion: 
1. Heart rate and/or blood pressure will be confirmed by [CONTACT_63788] 5 minutes between 
measurements, the average of all three measurements will be 
recorded  
2. The study investigator will reduce the dose of study drug back to 
previously tolerated dosing  
3. If hypotension or bradycardia develop after initiation prio r to uptitration, 
study drug will be stopped  
 
C.7.5. NYHA Classification  
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association classification of heart failure symptoms is a frequently 
used method of classifying the degree of heart failure symptoms a patient is 
experiencing.  The NY HA classification is shown below in Table 6.  The classification 
will be assessed on visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.  It will help objectively measure 
the degree of heart failure symptoms and the response of heart failure symptoms to 
carvedilol versus placebo in the study population.  NYHA classification will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_458], study investigator, research coordinator or 
appropriate designee.  
   
  
 
 34 Table 6. NYHA Heart Failure Symptom Classification  
 
 
C. 7.6. Adverse Drug R eaction  Screening  
At all study visit, the principal investigator, study investigator, research coordinator or 
other appropriate designee will assess the presence of possible side effects from 
carvedilol. The study participant will be screened for the pres ence of the following 
symptoms: dizziness, syncope, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fatigue, lethargy, mood changes, behavior 
changes, sleep disturbances, nightmares, headache, gastrointestinal pain, nausea, 
emesis, constipation, peripheral edema, wheezing, shortness of breath,  myalgias, back 
pain, cough, chest pain. CMP  and BNP  will be reviewed at visits 6 and 12 for presence 
of hepatic or renal dysfunction as previously described . If the patient is experiencing any 
of the listed side effects and it is felt by [CONTACT_63789]/or PI [INVESTIGATOR_63769], then the dose of study drug will be reduced to previously tolerated dose  
 
C.7.7 Laboratories  
CBC, CMP and BNP will be performed as part of the screening phase  (Visit 1)  as 
previously outlined.  CMP , BNP  will be performed at visit s 6, 7, and 12 .  All laboratories 
will be drawn at the Children’s Medical Center by a medical professional experienced in 
phlebotomy.  As previously mentioned, topi[INVESTIGATOR_63770].  After prop er labeling, blood will be sent to the Children’s Medical Center 
laboratory for immediate analysis. Urine p regnancy tests will be performed only on 
female participants 12 years of age and will be performed at Children’s Medical Center 
during the screening phase.  
 
 
 

 
 [ADDRESS_68797] -phase outcomes between Carvedilol 
and placebo, adj usting for pre -phase values, study phase (treatment phase 1 or 2) and 
treatment sequence.  Exploratory subgroup analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_63790][INVESTIGATOR_63771] (right/mixed versus left), baseline serum B -
type natriuretic  peptide (≥100pg/ml vs. <100pg/ml).  P -values < 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant . 
 
C.8.2. Power Calculations  
All power calculations were done with consultation from a biostastician, assuming an 
alpha level of 0.05 and 2 -sided hypothesis te sting.  Average peak VO 2 for Fontan 
patients in a large multi -institutional study was 26ml/kg/min.28  A previous study in adult 
heart failure demonstrated that a 6% increase in peak VO 2 was associated with 
reduction in cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].41  Therefore we 
conservatively chose a 10% change in peak VO 2 to be clinically meaningful, settin g the 
desired detectable difference in the change in peak VO 2 to be 2.6ml/kg/min.  The 
standard deviation of peak VO 2 in the before mentioned multi -institutional study was 
6.3ml/kg/min.  Prior research in a different study of adults with pulmonary and card iac 
disease suggests that repeated V0 2 measurements are highly correlated (r=0.95).[ADDRESS_68798] deviation of the V0 2 change scores to be ~3.98.  
Under these assumptions, enrolling n=20 subjects in this cross -over trial provides 80% 
power to detect a clinically significant difference between subjects’ peak V0 2 under the 2 
treatment co nditions’ (Carvedilol vs. placebo).  Therefore, a goal of 30 enrolled study 
participants was set to account for potential non -completion of the trial.

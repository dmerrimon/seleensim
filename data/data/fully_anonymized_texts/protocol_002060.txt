Protocol Number  HP 00061575    
Phase  Phase 2  
Methodology  This is a randomized, two-center, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -
controlled study.  Comparable, but not identical studies will be conducted at 
the two sites  
Study Duration  5 years  
Study Center(s)  University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and University of Maryland Baltimore 
(UMB)  
Objectives  Primary specific aim : to test the hypothesis that alcohol -dependen t 
individuals of  European ancestry (EAs) or of African American ancestry (AAs) 
carrying any one or a combination  of specific  genotypes will have a 
significantly lower number of drinks/drinking day (DDD) in response to  
ondansetron 0.33 mg twice daily , compared to those who are not carrying 
any of the selected genotypes or those who we re treated with the placebo .  
Secondary exploratory aim) : We further hypothesize that specific 
genotypes (which differ for AAs and EAs) will moderate the response to 
ondansetron. The genotypes of interest reflect polymorphisms in the genes 
encoding the ser otonin transporter ( SLC6A4 ) and the 5 -HT3A ( HTR3A ) and 
5-HT3B ( HTR3B ) receptor subunits.  
 
We also will test the additional secondary predictions  that the differences 
seen in  our primary specific aim (above ) will extend to secondary drinking 
measures and measures of quality of life. Additionally, we will use genome -
wide expression studies of total RNA and miRNA - from blood samples and 
supported by [CONTACT_906762] -to compare the [ADDRESS_1272963] responsive 
subjec ts (whose drinking is reduced most significantly) and the [ADDRESS_1272964] to identify changes that mediate 
ondansetron’s efficacy and adverse even ts profile, respectively.

Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  Statistical 
Methodology  All randomized subjects will be included in the analysis using the intent -to-
treat principle.  We will use a mixed -models approach, adjusting for baseline 
covariates (when significantly different by [CONTACT_19313]) and the same drinking 
variables for baseline.  For  the drinking variables, the baseline value is the 
average for the 30-day period prior to the screening visit.  Other potential 
covariates shall include age, race, and sex.  The primary outcome measure 
will be  DDD  during the 16-week treatment period.    
1 Introduction  
 This document is a protocol for a human research study. This clinical trial will  be 
conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 
part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines) , applicable government 
regulations and institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a heterogeneous and chronic relapsing disorder that 
includes both acute (binge drinking) and chronic (frequent heavy drinking ) dimensions.  Globally 
and in the [LOCATION_002], AUD ranks 5th and 3rd, respectively, among the most common 
preventable causes of morbidity and mortality.  
 Approximately 7.2 percent or 17 million adults in the [LOCATION_002] ages 18 and older 
had an AUD in  2012. This includes 11.2 million men and 5.7 million women. AUD can cause 
serious health, family, and economic problems. Finding treatments that are effective in 
decreasing heavy drinking among individuals with AUD is, therefore, an important scientific a nd 
health goal. Only a fraction of the people who could benefit from AUD treatment receives  
treatment . In 2012, for example, 1.4 million adults received treatment for an AUD at a 
specialized facility (8.4 percent of adults in need).        
 A novel and imp ortant strategy to improve AUD treatment outcomes uses a personalized 
medicine approach to optimize treatment response . This approach matches a subject   with 
specific genotypes to an appropriate medication with a high probability of a positive treatment 
outcome while also potentially minimizing adverse events.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_906724], pharmacotherapy remains an underutilized approach. This is, in large 
measure, a function of modest effect sizes associated with the FDA -approv ed medications for 
AUD.  
Personalized medicine offers the prospect of greater efficacy and safety by [CONTACT_906763].  
 This proposed study will address important limitations in a previously published Phase ΙΙ 
study  (Johnson et al. 2011) conducted in a sample of European Americans (EA ). In the first 
study12, Johnson et al. reported that 5 -HTTLPR:LL genotype in the gene that encodes the 
serotonin transporter molecule (SLC6A4) either alone or in combination with rs1042 173:TT of 
the same gene predicted response to ondansetron.  In a secondary analysis of the same 
sample, the authors reported three additional genotypes in the two genes that encode the 
primary binding site of ondansetron – the [ADDRESS_1272969], we will stratify the 
population into two main groups of participants base d on whether a participant is carrying any of 
the responsive genotypes (Genotype responsive group vs. Genotype non -responsive group). 
There are three main differences between the Genotype -responsive group defined by [CONTACT_906764] 2013 and the present study . 
(1) In this study, we will use the tri -allelic classification for 5 -HTTLPR of SLC6A4, the gene 
encoding the serotonin transporter (LA, LG or S alleles) to avoid the underestimation of 
pharmacogenetic effects associated with the use of the bi -allelic clas sification (L or S alleles). 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 3 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  We will limit the LL group to include o nly those who are LALA, will be considered as Genotype -
responsive as the LG allele has been shown to be associated with lower expression levels of 5 -
HTT mRNA similar to the S allele (2).  
(2) Carriers of rs1042173:TT (without 5 -HTTLPR:LALA) will be included in the Genotype 
responsive group, based on the findings that indicated a significant risk effect of rs1042173:TT 
on heavy drinking3.  
(3) Treatment assignment within Genotype Responsive g roup will be balanced at 
randomization according to genotype subgroups listed below, to accurately characterize the 
degree to which ondansetron’s therapeutic effect is enhanced by [CONTACT_906765]6A4 or any 
of the HTR3A/B genotypes.  
a. LALA in the absence  of rs1042173:TT and regardless of presence/absence of HTR3A/B 
genotypes  
b. rs1042173:TT in the absence of  LALA and regardless of presence/absence of HTR3A/B 
genotypes  
c. LALA together with rs1042173:TT and regardless of presence/absence of HTR3A/B 
genoty pes 
d. Any one or more HTR3A/B genotypes in the absence of  both LALA and rs1042173:TT   
Number of participants in the two main groups (Genotype responsive vs. non -responsive) as 
well as the four subgroups will represent population frequencies of constitue nt genotypes. This 
approach, as opposed to having equal numbers in each group, was adopted in order to include 
all participants who are otherwise qualified to be enrolled in this study.  At the UMB  site, we will 
enroll both African Americans (AAs) and EAs.  Because of differences in population frequencies 
and linkage disequilibrium structures, in AAs, we will explore the moderating effect of a non -
synonymous, functional SNP ( rs1176744)  that has been shown to be associated with alcohol 
dependence in AAs (Enoc h et al. 2011).  This SNP is in HTR3B , a gene in which variation was 
shown in the published Phase II study (Johnson et al. 2013) to moderate the response to 
ondansetron. (3) We will use the tri -allelic classification for 5 -HTTLPR of SLC6A4 , the gene 
encodi ng the serotonin transporter (L A, LG or S alleles) to avoid the underestimation of 
pharmacogenetic effects associated with the use of the bi -allelic classification (L or S alleles). 
We will limit the LL group to include only those who are L ALA, as the L G allele has been shown to 
be associated with lower expression levels of 5 -HTT mRNA similar to the S allele and will 
balance individuals within genotype (L ALA vs. non - LALA between the ondansetron and placebo 
groups in the primary randomization (4) We will al so balance individuals in the primary 
randomization within the two genotype groups of the SLC6A4  3′-UTR SNP rs1042173 (TT vs 
TG/GG). This will make it possible to characterize accurately the degree to which ondansetron’s 
therapeutic effect is moderated by [CONTACT_55464]1042173 and determine the independent therapeutic effect 
of ondansetron in individuals with the TT genotype. Finally, we will examine mRNA expression 
in a subset of individuals from the study to test whether the observed moderating effects of 
genotype ar e evident also in the expression of HTR3B  and SLC6A4 . 
  
In addition to conducting analyses separately using genotypes that are relevant to each  
racial group, we will  examine the findings from the two sites in a joint analysis.  
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Ondansetron, a specific serotonin -3 (5-HT 3) antagonist  is FDA approved to treat 
chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting, radiation -induced nausea and vomiting, and 
postoperative nausea and vomiting.  In the present study, subjects will be given on dansetron  
0.33 mg  or matching placebo capsules twice daily.

Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  The active ingredient in ondansetron tablets is ondansetron hydrochloride (HCl) as the 
dihydrate, the racemic form of ondansetron.  Chemically it is (±) 1, 2, 3, 9-tetrahydro -9-methyl -3-
[(2-methyl -1H-imidazol -1-yl)methyl] -4H-carbazol -4-one, monohydrochloride, dihydrate.  
Ondansetron’s empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] C18H19N3O•HCl•2H2O, representing a molecular weight of 
365.9.  
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Ondansetron’s effects are mediat ed through [ADDRESS_1272970] been used to study alterations in 5 -
HT current induced by [CONTACT_906766]  (Engel & Allan, 1999; Engel, Lyons, &  Allan, 
1998; Sung, Engel, Allan, & Lovinger, 2000) . These studies have shown that [ADDRESS_1272971] and increased dopamine release in 
the nucleus accumbens  (Allan, Galindo, Chynoweth, Engel, & Savage, 2001; Engel & Allan, 
1999; Engel, Lyons, & Allan, 1998; Sung, Engel, Allan, & Lovinger, 2000; Metz, Chynoweth, & 
Allen; 2006) . Using a transgenic mouse model lacking the  gene for the 5 -HT 3A receptor subunit, 
Hodge and colleagues (2004) showed that the reduction of alcohol drinking produced by [ADDRESS_1272972], cannot be extrapolated directly to studies in 
wild-type animals that can differ in the density and neuroanatomical distribution of 5 -HT 3 
receptors or to human studies, they do provide a framework which suggests that differential 5 -
HT 3 expression can influence alcohol consumption.  
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
Serotonin (5 -HT) function is an important regulator of alcohol consumption. The 
serotonin transporter (5 -HTT), which is encoded by [CONTACT_906767]6A4 , is the major modulator of 
neuronal 5 -HT function. Variation in SLC6A4  has been associated in humans with differences in 
alcohol craving and consumption. Specifically, in some studies, alcohol -dependent individuals 
who are homozygous for the long (L) allele of an insertion deletion polymorphism in the 5′ -
regulatory region of SLC6A4  (5-HTTLPR) or the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) rs1042173 in the 3′ -untranslated region (3′ -UTR) of that gene report increased craving 
and consumption of alcohol.   
SLC6A4 , which is located on ch romosome 17q11.1 –q12, is the only known gene 
encoding the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) in the human genome The  SLC6A4 promoter 
contains a functional insertion -deletion polymorphism (5′ -regulatory region of the 5 -HTT; 5 - 
HTTLPR) that results in a long (L) form, which possesses 44 base pairs that are absent in the 
short (S) allele. The 5 -HTTLPR polymorphism has been investigated extensively for a possible 
association with a wide range of psychiatric disorders including alcohol dependence. Recent 
research sug gests a gene -by [CONTACT_906768]. A neuroimaging study showed that 
alcohol -dependent LL genotype individuals had lower binding of the radioligand 123β-CIT (2 
beta-carbomethoxy -3 beta -(4-iodophenyl) tropane)  to the 5 -HTT in the raphe nuclei of the br ain 
than did healthy LL genotype individuals  (Heinz et al., 2000) . In contrast, within S -carriers 5-
HTT availability did not differ significantly between control and  alcoholic  subjects . Previous 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_906769] 5-HTTLPR 
genotype -based differences in 5 -HTT availability and function. Specifically, among individuals  
with the L allele,  a greater quantity of lifetime alcohol consu mption was associated with lower 
levels of 5 -HT uptake and binding  (Javors et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2008) .  Taken together, 
these findings suggest a potential selective susceptibility of L -allele carr ying individuals to the 
neurotoxic effects of chronic excessive alcohol consumption . Johnson et al. (2013)  discovered 
that another functional allelic variant, the SNP rs1042173 (T/G) in the 3′ - untranslated region (3′ -
UTR) of SLC6A4 , is associated with the  intensity of alcohol consumption measured by [CONTACT_906770]-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1272973] drinks ([ADDRESS_1272974] drink = about 14g of 100% alcohol) consumed per 
drinking day  (Seneviratne, Huang, Ait -Daoud, & Johnson, 2009) . TT homozygotes at this locus, 
compared with G -allele carr iers, had a significantly greater intensity of alcohol consumption. T -
allele -transfected HeLa cells had lower levels than their G allele counterparts of expression of 
both 5 -HTT mRNA and protein. Because rs1042173 is located at or near a potential binding site 
for several microRNAs in the 3′ -UTR of the gene, the variant may alter expression levels by 
[CONTACT_906771].  
Lowered [ADDRESS_1272975] that blockade of upregulated 5-HT 3 
receptors by [CONTACT_74896] (a specific 5-HT [ADDRESS_1272976]) would reduce heavy drinking . 
We hypothesize that, among  individuals with an AUD , the alcohol consumption -promoting 
effects of  the 5 -HTTLPR and 3′ -UTR variants are due to lower 5 -HTT function and decreased 5 -
HTT expression through reduced stability of mRNA, respectively —effects that individually lead 
to substantial postsynaptic [ADDRESS_1272977].  
 In a phase 2, randomized, double -blind clinical trial of 283 alcohol -dependent individuals 
of EA or AA  ancestry , treatment with the specific serotonin -3 (5-HT 3) antagonist ondansetron, 
presumably through its neuromodulatory effects at postsynap tic 5-HT receptors, significantly 
reduced drinking among those who were homozygous for the L allele of the 5 -HTTLPR —an 
effect that was enhanced in individuals who were T -allele homozygotes for the 3′ -UTR SNP  
(Johnson et al., 2011) . Further analysis of this  data set revealed additional polymorphisms 
located on the genes for the A and B subunits of the serotonin  5-HT 3 receptor that were also 
associated with a therapeutic response to ondansetron  (Johnson, Seneviratne, Wang, Ait -
Daoud, & Li, 2013  
The proposed s tudy is designed to address several important limitations of the above 
mentioned phase 2 clinical trials  that tested the efficacy of ondansetron in AUD. Addressing 
these limitations (listed below), would further establish the use of ondansetron as an effic acious 
pharmacotherapy for AUD utilizing a personalized genetic (pharmacogenetic) approach.  The 
current study is a proof -of-concept, double -blind, randomized clinical trial to test whether, 
treatment -seeking, alcohol -dependent AA and EA adults  carrying s pecific genotypes show  a 
significantly greater and more robust treatment response to ondansetron than placebo and/or 
non-carriers of the genotypes, as reflected in greater reductions in DDD.  
 
Genetic association studies : An examination of 360 treatment -seeking AA male subjects 
with DSM -IV lifetime diagnos es of alcohol, cocaine, a nd heroin dependence  and   187 showed a 
significant association between alcohol dependence and the functional SNP rs1176744  in  
HTR3B which encode s a subunit of the  5-HT 3AB receptor (Enoch et al., 2011) .  These findings 
were supported by [CONTACT_906772] a 5 -
HT 3B genotype and alcohol dependence with antisocial behaviors  (Ducci et al., 2009) .  A recent 
candidate gene association analysis in EAs also showed a strong interactive effect of 5 -
HTTLPR, rs1042173 and 5-HT 3AB variants associated with AUD  (Seneviratne et al., 2013) . 
Taken together, these studies suggest that variation in the genes encoding the [ADDRESS_1272978] to be 
demonstrated in a clinical study of ondansetron, rather than only in disease risk association 
studies.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 6 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  Clinical Study : Based on the expectation that allelic variants within e ither homomeric or 
heteromeric 5-HT [ADDRESS_1272979] the response to ondansetron, Johnson et al. (2011)  
conducted an additional analysis on the same sam ple included in the  phase 2 ondansetron 
study described above that considered multiple SNPs located on genes for the 5 -HT 3A and 5 -
HT 3B subunits of the 5 -HT 3 receptor. Th e latter analysis  (Johnson et al. 2013)  investigated the 
associations between drinking severity and 18 SNPs across HTR3A  and HTR3B  genes using 
blood samples for genetic testing and ondansetron response data from the Phase 2 trial of 
ondansetron ( 4 μg/kg, twice daily)  versus placebo in 283 alcohol -dependent individuals with or 
without the LL/TT genotypes of the 5 -HTT (described above: Johnson et al., 2011) .  The 
analysis focused on 18 SNPs selected based on their minor allele frequency (≥ 0.05), their 
physical distribu tion on the HTR3A  and HTR3B  genes to obtain uniform physical coverage, and 
results from previous genetic association studies.  
This analysis identified three HTR3A  and HTR3B  genotypes that were significantly 
associated with a positive response to ondansetron  in the EA sample  (see Table 1) .  Because of 
population differences in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium structure, the study of 
AAs will examine ondansetron r esponse in relation to genetic variants that overlap, but are not 
identical, with those being examined in the EA sample  (see section 3.1 below) .  
Table 1: HTR3A and HTR3B genotype associations with response to ondansetron  in EAs  
 
    Use of a larger ancestry -informative SNP panel for assessment of population admixture 
between samples in the two treatment groups:  
Allelic differences among populations are potential confounders in genetic association 
analyses, which may result in spurious associations . The differences in population admixture 
between subjects included in ondansetron and placebo groups  of the Phase 2 study described 
above were tested using the program STRUCTURE   
(http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/software/structure2_2.html) , which revealed no statistically 
significant difference between the two groups.  As the subjects  consisted of two groups, 
Caucasians and Hispanics, individual genetic ancestry proportions were calcul ated for all 
283 subjects and were used as  covariates in all of the above -mentioned statistical models that 
tested HTR3A , HTR3B and SLC6A4  genotype effects.  Genetic ancestry proportions are 
increasingly being used as covariates in genetic association anal yses as a strategy to limit type 
I error  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_906725]., 2011; Sucheston et al., 2011) 1-3.  In this Phase 2 trial, to prevent 
spurious associations resulting from population stratification, genetic ancestry proportions will 
be assessed using a panel of 186 ancestry informative SN Ps described by [CONTACT_906773].,  
(2008) as opposed to the [ADDRESS_1272980] during data analysis , using the 
statistical software p ackage  Structur e (Pritchard, Stephens, & Donnelly, 2000) [ADDRESS_1272981] will be used as covariates in statistical analyses.

Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
 Dose Selection:  Selection of the 0.33 mg dose is based on the results of prior Phase 2 
studies (Johnson et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2000; Sellers et al., 1994) ). Johnson et al.  (2011) 1-
[ADDRESS_1272982] observation during 
the baseline visit (first dose at study Week 0) and on study Weeks 4  and 8 (first dose of the 
week). All other doses will be take -home. The investigator will closely monitor the subject for 
any adverse events or lack of tol erability.  Subjects will continue twice -daily dosing at home, and 
will be counseled to take the study medication at approximately the same times each day.  
 Subject s will be asked to return all unused study medication  and packaging to the study 
staff.  Throughout the study, the staff will closely monitor the subject for dosing compliance and 
adverse events or lack of tolerability to the study medication.  If the subject stops taking study 
medication for any reason and later, upon discussion with the inve stigator, wishes to  restart the 
study medication, he/she  will be provided with that opportunity no later than the study visit 
immediately following the request.  Interruption in study medication will be documented on the 
case report form.  If the subject w ishes not to restart the medication, he/she  will be encouraged 
to continue to participate in all scheduled study visits and assessments.  The case report form 
will document the duration through which the subject took study medication.  
 Contraindications :  The concomitant use of apomorphine  with ondansetron is 
contraindicated based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when 
apomorphine was  administered with ondansetron. Ondansetron is also  contraindicated for 
patients known to have hyp ersensitivity to the drug.  
 Warnings :  
 Hypersensitivity reactions  have been reported in patients who have exhibited 
hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT [ADDRESS_1272983] been reported in 
patients using ondansetron.  Ondansetron should not be administered to patients with 
congenit al long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte 
abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, 
bradyarrhythmias or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation.  
High-dose, intravenous ondansetron (32 mg) has been associated with prolongation of 
the QTc interval. Freedman et al. (201 4) reviewed t he risk of cardiac arrhythmia associated with 
ondansetron).  Over the 22 years since ondansetron has been approved, no one case  of an 
arrhythmia following a single oral dose of ondansetron has been reported. Furthermore, the 
maximal QTc lengthening from a 32 mg IV dose (100 x the dose proposed in the stud y) of 
ondansetron is 17 -20 msec  but only 5 .8 msec  after an 8 mg  oral dose  (24 x the dose proposed 
in this study) .  Additionally, the peak serum level of oral ondansetron is only 3 to 35% of IV 
ondansetron.   Individuals identified by [CONTACT_906774]. (2014) to be  most at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_906726] -arrthymic medications. As a precaution , we have 
incorporated appropriate exclusion criteria (long QTc syndrome) even though it would require 
that approximately 16,[ADDRESS_1272984] s of the currently proposed chronic low 
dose of onda nsetron (0.66 mg/day) on the QTc interval.  Subjects will also be screened for 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1272985] been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs), 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtaza pi[INVESTIGATOR_050], fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous 
methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with 
overdose of ondansetron  alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin 
syndrome related to 5-HT [ADDRESS_1272986] -anesthesia care unit or an 
infusion center.  Serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and 
symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), 
autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, 
hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, 
incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., na usea, vomiting, 
diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially 
with concomitant use of ondansetron  and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin 
syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron  and initiate supp ortive treatment. Patients should be 
informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron  is used 
concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs .   
 Drug Interactions : Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-
450 drug -metabolizing enzyme system of the liver but is metabol ized by [CONTACT_34576].  
Theoretically , inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, 
the half -life of ondansetron. On the basis of available data, however, no dosage adjustment is 
recommended for patients on these drugs.  Thus, we will inform patients being treated with 
serotonergic antidepressants that the potential exists for an interaction with the study 
medication and we will monitor their progress accordingl y.  It should be noted, however, that the 
low dose of ondansetron that is being used in this study (0.6 6 mg/day), is unlikely to contribute 
to serotonin syndrome. Notably, the dosage of ondansetron that is commonly prescribed to 
prevent nausea and vomiting  is 16 mg/day, thus the dosage used in the current study is less 
than 1/2 4 the anti -emetic dosage.  
 Apomorphine : Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness  
when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, concomitant use of apomo rphine 
with ondansetron is contraind icated.  
 Phenytoin, Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] : In patients treated  with potent inducers  
of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]), the clearance of ondansetron 
was significantly increased and ondanse tron blood concentrations were decreased. 
However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is 
recommended for patients on these drugs . 
 Tramadol:  Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and  
tramadol  has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be 
associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.  
 Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome (altered mental status, autonomic  
instability, and neuromus cular abnormalities) has been associated with the concomitant use of 5-
HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram,) and serotonin and noradren aline 
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g. venlafaxine). As indicated above, the likelihood of such an 
interaction is very small given the very low dosage of ondansetron being used in this study.  To 
ensure the safety of participants, we will monitor the appea rance of signs and symptoms of the 
serotonin syndrome at every study visit  after screening , using a standardized Serotonin Syndrome 
Symptom Checklist. Two or more positive responses on the Serotonin Syndrome Symptom Checklist will 
trigger further clinical evaluation. If there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_906727], the study 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 9 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  medication will be immediately stopped and the participant told to also immediately stop taking the 
serotonergic concomitant medication.  (See section 5.6).  
 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  Ondansetron was not mutagenic 
in standard tests for mutagenicity.  
 Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects:  Pregnancy Category B. Should a woman become 
pregnant at any point in the study, we will immediately discontinue the tr eatment and refer her 
to an obstetrician for evaluation. We will also maintain contact [CONTACT_906775] -reported safety information and, with her permission 
and that of her physician, will obtain informati on from her medical chart.  
 Adverse Reactions:  Studies examining adverse events associated with ondansetron 
(at a dosage much higher than th e one  being used in the present study) have focused on two 
patient groups: individuals receiving high -dose chemother apy and subjects being treated for 
post-operative nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron was well  tolerated in the postoperative 
nausea and vomiting population (n = 1081), which is more representa tive of our proposed 
population.  In this group,  adverse events we re similar between ondansetron and placebo  (see 
Table 2 ) 
 Post-marketing reports : Post-marketing  reports are voluntar y, therefore  the frequency  of 
the following adverse events  are unknown: transient ECG c hanges ( rare and predominantly with 
intravenous ondansetron) ; flushing ; hypersensitivity reactions (rare), sometimes severe (e.g., 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, 
hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) ; allergic reactions, including laryngospasm, shock, and 
cardiopulmonary arrest ( predominantly the injectable formulation). Also reported: liver enzyme 
abnormalities, hiccups, o culogyric crisis  (alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions ), 
urticaria , and transient blindness (predominantly  with the intravenous formulation and resolve d 
within a few minutes up to 48 hours ).

Physical Risks:  Peripheral venipuncture poses a small risk of bruising and local infection at 
the needle puncture site.  
 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 10 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  Minimization of the risks: This risk of bruising and local infection at the needle site will be 
minimized by  [CONTACT_906776], simple procedures to ensure 
hemostasis.  
 
    Psychological Ri sks: Psychological risks can include distress and heightened sensitivity, 
which can occur as part of the  behavioral treatments, clinical interviews, or completion of self -
reported ratings and questionnaires. While the  possibility of such events is low, we will monitor 
these situations and provide an appropriate level of support.  
Such events will be documented fully in the case records.  
 
Minimization of the risks: The potential for psychological harm will be reduced by [CONTACT_906777]. Subjects will be allowed to take session breaks at any time, or reschedule a session 
(consistent with the overall study schedule).  Experienced clinical personnel are available a t the 
CNC to evaluate subjects who express distress or discomfort over study procedures. We  have 
surveyed our subjects and found good satisfaction with the quality of care that they have 
received.  
Overall, the development of carefully standardized and supe rvised SOP has allowed us to 
develop a high standard of care  
  
   Social and Legal  Risks:  Social and legal risks can include the disclosure of sensitive 
information about a subject to some other agency or an employer.  
 
Minimization of the risks: The likelihood of information from our clinic being disseminated 
without the  subject’s consent to an outside source is remote. No information about a subject is 
disclosed without his or her  written authority. Case records also are kept at a secure location in 
locked files. Access to these files is  restricted to known personnel, who must fill out an entry 
form to receive any subject’s records. Computer based  information contains subject numbers 
and codes that cannot be traced directly back to the original  records. The computer records are 
protected by [CONTACT_906778] C2 security  standards of the U.S. 
Department of Defense.  
 
     Risk of participation becoming part of the medical record:  If a participant needs to be 
seen by a non -study physician and/or admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81381], in order to provide 
medical treatment; it may be necessary to inform treatment providers (medical staff) of his/her 
participation in this study. This may include information regarding the u se of alcohol in this study. 
This information can become part of the participant’s medical records. When insurance 
companies review medical record information, they might see the documentation of alcohol use 
and/or abuse as justification for denying covera ge or charging higher premiums. Also it is possible 
for medical records to be entered as evidence in court.  
 
   Risks associated with questionnaires:   Participants will be asked questions of a sensitive 
nature concerning their medical, psychiatric, drug, and personal history, which some may find 
anxiety -provoking.  
 
Minimization of risk: To minimize this risk, research personnel are highly trained to be sensitive 
and responsive. All answers will be strictly confidential. In addition, a federal Certificate of 
Confidentiality will be obtained pending IRB approval of the protocol.  
 
 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 11 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018      Risk  associated with pregnancy :   The safety of ondansetron to an unborn child is not 
established. For these reasons, pregnant women will not be allowed to participate.  
 
Minim ization of risk: Women of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable form of birth 
control to participate in this study and have no intention of becoming pregnant.  
 
   Risk of alcohol withdrawal:   Alcohol withdrawal may occur from suddenly stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_906728].  
 
Minimization of risk: Presence and severity of acute alcohol withdrawal will be assessed at 
baseline and subjects who are experiencing significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms will be 
referred for treatment . 
 
   Risk of breach of confidentiality:  The research team is highly experienced providing care 
and doing research of this nature.  
 
Minimization of risk: All subject contact [CONTACT_906779] a private room.  All study staff are well -trained 
and experienced in practices to protect confidentiality.  
 
 
The risks to subjects in this study are low. The medication, ondansetron, is well tolerated, and 
we have experience with its use in alcohol -dependent subjects for whom no serious a dverse 
events were re ported. We will minimize the risks to subjects participating in this study by 
[CONTACT_906780].  
 
An alternative to participation in the study is for subjects to seek treatmet for alcohol use 
disorder from a treatme nt facility.  Alternative treatment may include taking a medication (other 
than ondansetron) that is FDA -approved for the treatment of AUD (disulfiram, naltrexone, and 
acamprosate), or psychosocial treatment without any medication  
 
 
2 Study Objectives  
The primary study objective is to determine the efficacy of ondansetron 0.33 mg  twice 
daily, administered orally for a period of 16 weeks in reducing  heavy drinking  ( characterized by 
[CONTACT_286846]) in carriers of specific SLC6A4, HTR3A and HTR3B “responsive” genoty pes and 
secondary measures of drinking and quality of life  among current drinking subjects. We will also 
compare ondansetron with placebo in subgroups of the sample based on  alcohol  intake . We 
also will test the additional secondary predictions that the differences seen in our primary 
specific aim will extend to secondary drinking measures and measures of quality of life. 
Additionally, we will use genome -wide expression studies of total RNA and miRNA - from blood 
samples and supported by [CONTACT_906781]-to compare the [ADDRESS_1272987] responsive subjects 
(whose drinking is reduced most significantly) and the [ADDRESS_1272988] to 
identify changes that medi ate ondansetron’s efficacy and adverse events profile, respectively.  
AUD  is a heterogeneous and chronic relapsing disorder that includes both acute (binge 
drinking) and chronic (frequent heavy drinking) dimensions. Perhaps because of this 
heterogeneity, th e therapeutic effect size of the approved medicines for  the treatment of AUD 
has been small  (Johnson & Ait -Daoud, 2011) .  In an effort to overcome the heterogeneity of 
response to a particular medication, recent studies have instituted a personalized appro ach to 
therapy  (Kranzler and McKay  2012). Major breakthroughs in pharmacogenetics have made it 
possible to identify discrete subgroups of the AUD population according to genetic profiles in 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1272989] likely to respond to tre atment with a particular agent. 
In addition, genetic variation contributing to the risk of alcohol dependence may be differentially 
associated with treatment response  (Johnson et al., 2011; Kranzler et al., 2014; Oslin et al., 
2003) . Thus, a successful personalized pharmacologic approach should ensure that targeted 
subgroups achieve an optimal treatment response with high predictability.  Such an approach 
holds the potential to identify not only robust responders to treatment but als o those who might 
have minimal or modest adverse effects from the putative therapeutic medication.  From a 
practical clinical standpoint, a personalized medicine approach starts with a screen to identify 
the subject ’s salient genotypes, in order to match t he subject with the appropriate  medication  to 
ensure  a high probability of a positive treatment outcome . This approach has the potential to 
exert  a substantial  positive  impact on public health  (Kranzler and McKay, 2012) . 
Hypothesis:  
Our overarching hypoth esis is that , in both AAs and EAs, ondansetron 0.33 mg twice 
daily will decrease the intensity of  drinking (i.e., the number of DDD)  more than placebo.  We 
further hypothesize that the effect will be greater in specific genotype groups in the two 
populations and we will b alance the randomization on this genetic variation separately by 
[CONTACT_906782].  
Other exploratory aims will be examined in separate str ata across both study sites , with 
treatment assignment at randomization  balanced based on the genotypes that are relevant to 
each population :  to test the hypothesis that alcohol -dependent individuals with 5 -HTTLPR LALA 
genotype in SLC6A4  (which encodes th e serotonin transporter protein). We also will test the 
secondary  prediction s that the differences in our primary specific aims will extend to secondary 
drinking measures and measures of quality of life .  
Finally,  we will use   
genome -wide expression studie s of total RNA and miRNA - from blood samples and 
supported by [CONTACT_906762] - to compare the most responsive subjects  (whose 
drinking is reduced most significantly) and [ADDRESS_1272990]  to 
identify changes that mediate ondansetron’s efficacy and adverse events profile, 
respectively.  
 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
 
This is a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase 2 clinical trial to 
explore the safety and efficacy of ondansetron to reduce drinking in tensity in AA and EA adult 
subjects with AUD who commonly engage in heavy drinking . We will use selected  genotype 
polymorphisms  of the serotonin transporter and 5-HT 3B receptor genes  to examine ondansetron 
effects in subgroups based upon genotype . Analyses based on genotype will be conducted 
separately in EA and AA because different, but overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], genetic variants are relevant as 
potential moderators of ondanse tron response  in the two populations . The UPENN site is 
conducting a parallel study with both EAs and AAs.  
Probability of group assignment and potential for subjects to be randomized to placebo 
group :   
European Americans  
Participants with EA  race will be  selected based on absence/presence of any one of the 
combination of the following genotypes and will have equal  probability (i.e., 50 -50 chance) of 
being assigned to receive ondansetron (active medication) or placebo.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 13 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018   
Subjects will be balanced  based on their SLC6A4 genotypes , • 5-HTTLPR:LL together with 
rs25531:AA (L ALA genotype) in SLC6A4 gene;  
• SLC6A4 -rs1042173: TT;  
• HTR3A -rs1150226: AG;  
• HTR3A -rs1176713:  GG; 
• HTR3B -rs17614942: AC  
  
African Americans  
 Participants with AA will be selected based on having a CC or TC genotype at rs176744 , 
with each participant having an equal probability (i.e., 50 -50 chance) of being assigned to 
receive ondansetron (active medication) or placebo.  
Participants  will be bal anced based on their SLC6A4 genotypes:  
 5-HTTLPR -LALA vs. non - LALA genotypes  
 rs1042173*TT vs. TG/GG genotypes .  
…. 
  
 
Eligible subjects will be stratified into two groups (Genotype responsive vs. non -responsive). 
Genotype responsive group will include the carriers of the above mentioned genotypes and the 
non-responsive group will include those who do not carry any of the above genotypes.  
 
 Genotypes will be determined within one week of the Screen  Visit. Primary Study 
Endpoints  
 Drinking variables will be derived from the data collected by [CONTACT_906783] -back 
Interview ( TLFB ). Baseline for the drinking variables is defined as the 90 days  preceding the 
baseline visit. One month is defined as 4 weeks (28 days).  
 Primary Efficacy Variable : Change from baseline in the number of drinks per drinking 
day (DDD) during the last 8 weeks  of the 16 week treatment period . 
3.2 Secondary Study Endpoints  
 Key Secondary Variables  
o Responder analysis: Number of subjects with no HDDs  during the last [ADDRESS_1272991] drinks /day over the last 4 weeks of the 16-week treatment 
period.  
 
 .   
Change from baseline in the percentage  of heavy drinking days ( PHDDs) defined as a 
day on which men drink >5  
drinks  and women drink >4 drinks.

Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  3.3 Primary Safety Endpoints  
Safety evaluations, including laboratory assessments, physical examination, vital signs, 
12-lead ECG and assessment of alcohol withdrawal, depression and suicidal risk, and querying 
for adverse events will be performed  to identify safety issues in the study.   
 Hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, urine drug screen, medical history, psychiatric 
history, and physical examination will be performed at baseline and at varying intervals during 
the 16-week tre atment, a s described in detail in Table 3 below . 
Body weight and    
vital signs (including temperature , systolic and diastolic  blood pressure , heart rate and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])  will be measured at screening/baseline and at every study visit.  
The Clinical In stitute Withdrawal Assess ment for Alcohol scale  (CIWA -Ar) is a reliable 
and well -validated , 10-item scale to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms . 
Alcohol withdrawal symptoms at the screening visit constitute a screen failure.   Any post -
scree ning physical finding from the CIWA -Ar that is considered to be clinically significant will be 
reported as an adverse event.  
The 21 -item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be used to measure depressive 
symptoms. Questions focus on topi[INVESTIGATOR_906729],  suicidal  thoughts , sleep habits, and eating 
behaviors. The BDI will be administered at every study visit.  At screening/baseline, subjects 
with severe, untreated depression or who endorse suicidal intent will be excluded from the study 
and referred for treatment or immediate intervention.  At each post -baseline visit, the staff will 
review the findings on the BDI to ensure that the subject’s safety is not compromised by 
[CONTACT_906784].  
 Careful screening using  the MINI International Neuro psychiatric Interview 6.0  (MINI)  
Suicide Risk Assessment Scale (module B)  will serve to exclude individuals with s ignificant 
suicidal risk.  O ngoing monitoring using that instrument throughout the study will serve to reduce 
the risk of intentional overdose  or other suicidal behavior.  The MINI B   will also be used to 
assess suicide risk  at each study visit, and if rated equal to or greater than 9 (i.e., clinically 
significant suicidal ideation), a study physician will be consulted to decide the appropriate 
clinical management.

[ADDRESS_1272992] Selection and Withdrawal  
 Men and women,  18 to 70 years old, will b  recruited : 183 AA and 183 EA. EAs will be 
self-identified as White, non-Hispanic or Hispanic individuals . Approximately 30% of the total 
cohort will be women.  Minorities and women will, therefore, be well represented in this trial. 
Children between the ages of 18 y ears and 21 years will be included in this study.  This is in 
accordance with NIH guidelines for the inclusion of children in clinical studies, if appropriate. 
The inclusion of children enhances the generalizability of the results of clinical studies to the  
general population.  
 The ethnic group commonly known as “Hispanic” or “Latino” is an admixed population 
that primarily resulted from two -way admixture between Native American and European 
populations or three -way admixture among Native American, European,  and West African 
populations. In admixed individuals with a disease, chromosomal segments harboring 
susceptibility variants will show an excess of ancestry from the parental population in which the 
risk alleles are more frequent  (Mao et al., 2007) , leadin g to genetic subgroups within a 
population. The existence of genetic subgroups or substructure in a population may lead to 
spurious associations if the subgroups are not equally represented in cases and controls  (Lai et 
al., 2009) . Balancing for subgroups in a genetic association study examining a common disorder 
such as AUD will require a large number of subjects to permit an analysis of  the subtle effects of 
multiple polymorphisms with sufficient statistical power.   For this reason, the current study will  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 17 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  be limited to subjects of predominantly (>75%) European and African ancestry.  This will include 
Hispanic/ Latino individuals who self -report being of African  or European  ancestry.   
Number  of subjects (at each site ) needed to complete the protocol :  [ADDRESS_1272993] a total of 128 completing subjects (from either race).  
 
Expected rate of screen failure/ dropouts/withdrawals from all sites :  Allowing for a 30% 
drop-out rate (during the course of the study , which is about 4 months), as seen in previous 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_978]’s research team, we will need to randomize about [ADDRESS_1272994] 128 subjects complet e the protocol.

4.[ADDRESS_1273008] Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects will be recruited at research centers at the Clinical Neurobehavioral Center 
(CNC) at UMB .  Advertisements for the study will state clearly that there will be no cost to the 
subject for participation.  Only recruitment ma terials and methods approved by [CONTACT_906786].  We recognize that our recruit ment  efforts may yield individuals in need of treatment 
who do not qualify for the present study.  We will try to enroll these individuals in other ongoing 
studies at our sites.  Should subjects fail to qualify or decline to participate in other ongoing 
treatment studies at our research centers, we will assist with a referral to another treatment 
facility.  
 Subjects will be recruited through  local advertisements , possibly including posters, flyers, 
newspaper, radio, television, electronic communications (including email and social media),  
Craig slist, advertisements on mass transit, referrals from local treatment programs and centers , 
and commercial sites such as such as gambling casinos, race tracks (horse, auto), hunting and 
fishing supply stores, auto supply stores, and stores selling alcoholic beverages.  
 University health systems , community agencies, and local college campuses that offer 
services and means of po sting and distributing recruitment materials in the community settings 
with public posting areas or providing community access to materials ( such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], town 
halls, public libraries, YMCAs, health fairs, etc.) We will obtain permission at selected locations 
before distributing or posting the approved recruitment materials (ensuring  compliance with 
other institution guidelines , including seeking IRB approval as needed) . We will also screen  
patient databases as permitted by [CONTACT_906787] d by [CONTACT_1201] . We will search the 
University of Maryland Medical Center and FPI [INVESTIGATOR_906735], medical diagnosis codes related to AUD and 
exclusionary comorbid diagnoses, and residence wit hin commuting distance of CNC. We will 
contact [CONTACT_906788] -approved outreach letters from the study PI.  About a week 
after sending the letter, we will make a follow -up phone call to these individuals if no response 
has been received.   
Subjects  who express interest will be invited  to participate in a telephone screening interview. 
Prior to initiating screening, w e will describe the nature of the study  to the subject , including the 
number of visits to the center, subject protections , and confidentiality. If the caller remains  
interested, we will obtain  oral consent for the phone screening. Screening questions cover 
general health, psychiatric history and alcohol consumption  (AUDIT, see section 6.7 below) . If 
we determine the applicant  to be  eligible based on this screening, s/he will be asked whether 
they wish to participate.  If so, s/he will be scheduled for an initial  in-person  appointment , at 
which informed consent will be obtained .  
 We will request a  partial waiver of HIPAA Autho rization from the IRB to allow for 
preliminary telephone screening for calls initiated  or invited (e.g., following our having contact[CONTACT_906789])  by [CONTACT_52893].  Individuals deemed eligible for in -person screening will 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1273009] 
been approved by [CONTACT_906790].  The telephone screening interview will include: a) 
demographic dat a; b) medical status; c) a brief psychiatric history; d) a brief TLFB for alcohol 
consumption ; e) drug use history  and e) questions to assess motivation to engage in treatment.  
Prospective participants will contact [CONTACT_906791]. On the telephone, recruiting staff 
will provide information about the trial and will provide the caller with the eligibility criteria. 
Recruitment staff will follow an IRB approved telephone script. If the caller remains interested in 
participation, he or she will be inform ed about a time to come to the CNC for medical screening. 
Our intake interviewers have been trained specifically in these tasks.  This enhances data 
quality and increases the likelihood of suitable subjects being invited for intake.  Collection of 
these da ta, which are identical to some of the measures in the proposed study, will allow for 
comparison of the target and study populations.  Additionally, it will improve the efficiency of the 
study and reduce the likelihood of unsuitable subjects having to unde rgo a full screening before 
being excluded.  The telephone screening interviews will be conducted only by [CONTACT_100822].  Once subjects pass this telephone screen, we will schedule an intake examination within 
[ADDRESS_1273010] subjects who discontinue treatment prior to  
completing the 16-week treatment period: [ADDRESS_1273011] (either with the subject or by [CONTACT_47067] a message on voicemail or a 
person answering the subject’s telephone), followed by [ADDRESS_1273012], followed by a letter. Only if all of 
these efforts are unsuccessful in obtaining follow -up information (either during an in -person visit 
or a telephone interview), w ill the subject be considered to be lost to follow -up.  
An investigator may discontinue medication and withdraw the subject from the study if 
he or she deems it clinically appropriate or for any of the following reasons: 1) significant side 
effects from th e medication, 2) serious or unexpected adverse events, 3) inability to comply with 
the study protocol, 4) protocol  violation, or 5) serious inter current illness.  A subject may 
withdraw from the study anytime he or she wishes.  In the event that a subject is discontinued 
from receiving the research medication but may be able to continue with the psychosocial 
intervention, the subject will be allowed to continue the psychosocial intervention visits with the 
approval of the investigator.   
At week 16, subject s that request ongoing care will be given a referral to an alcohol 
treatment facility or may be given a list of alcohol treatment facilities to contact.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_1273013] who discontinues treatment prematurely, regardless of the reason, will be 
requested to return for a final visit to do the necessary procedures and obtain data for end -of-
study/early -termination and follow -up visits.   Following an early termination, an effort will be

termination and the scheduled endpoint.  
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 The only inv estigational agent to be used in this study is ondansetron, a specific 
serotonin -3 (5-HT 3) antagonist that is FDA approved to treat chemotherapy -induced nausea and 
vomiting, radiation -induced nausea and vomiting, and postoperative nausea and vomiting.  In 
the present study, subjects will be given ondansetron at a dosage of 0.33 mg  or matching 
placebo capsules  by [CONTACT_906792].  
 The active ingredient in ondansetron tablets is ondansetron hydrochloride (HCl) as the 
dihydrate, the racemic form of ondanset ron.  Chemically it is (±) 1, 2, 3, 9 -tetrahydro -9-methyl -3-
[(2-methyl -1H-imidazol -1-yl)methyl] -4H-carbazol -4-one, monohydrochloride, dihydrate.  
Ondansetron’s empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] C18H19N3O•HCl•2H2O, representing a molecular weight of 
365.9.  
5.2 Treatment Reg imen  
 Ondansetron 0.33 mg or matching placebo by [CONTACT_6816] 16 weeks.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 Randomization : Subj ects within each of the [ADDRESS_1273015] ’s ID number and UMB Investigational Drug Service (IDS)  randomization  to 
ondansetron or placebo . The UMB pharmacist is responsible to keep  the treatment assignments  
recorded on the Randomization List Forms  confidential and completely blinded from the staff  
involved in the trial , except as specified under the emergency conditions for which both sites 
have written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP s). Upon receipt of the Subject 
Randomiza tion Form for a particular participant, the pharmacist shall communicate to the 
research staff which of the medication kits provided to the site is to be used for that subject . All 
clinical staff members directly involved with the assessment of subjects ar e always blind to the 
medication condition. These procedures have been designed to avoid delay. An IDS staff 
person , who is not otherwise involved in the study , will perform the  randomization and 
assignment o f eligible subjects into treatment groups . All p articipants and other investigators will 
be blinded.  
 Only subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized  
to treatment .  One hundred eighty -three  subjects with  a DSM -5 AUD will be randomized into  two 
medication groups (ondansetron or placebo ; N=~91/group) .  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_3725], race, gender and genotype.  There will be 8 genotype strata (based on all combinations of 
3 loci or SNP’s) for AAs and 2 genotype strata  (“responsive ”  vs. “non-respon sive” genotype 
combinations)  for EAs,   based on the race -specific genotypes defined in section 3.1 above ). 
Treatment g roup assignment will be  assigned using a block randomization procedure  that 
balances the treatment groups  within the above defined strata.    
 The IDS at UMB  will implement the randomization for both participating sites.   The 
clinical coordinator will collate intake data essential for assignment to a treatment group, 
including genotype information that will be  used to complete a Subject Randomization Form.  A 
study physician or nurse practitioner must sign the Subject Randomization Form.  This signature 
  
[CONTACT_25553]-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 23 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  functions as a prescription for the U MB IDS to distribute medication to the participating sites at 
both unive rsities.  A copy of the form is kept in the Case Report Form (CRF), and the original is 
provided to the pharmacist at U MB.  The U MB pharmacist will then complete all identifying 
information required on the Subject Dose Record Form.  The Subject Dose Record  Form 
records the subject  ID number.   The pharmacist is responsible to keep the dose assignments 
recorded on the Subject Dose Record Form confidential and completely blinded from the local 
investigative research staff, except as specified under the emerge ncy conditions for which all 
the sites have written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  Upon receipt of the faxed 
Subject Randomization Form for a particular participant (which will  be faxed to the UMB IDS  
Monday through Friday, from 8 AM to 4 PM ), the UMB pharmacist will fax back to the site the 
identity of the medication kit to be dispensed to the subject.  Medication starter kits for the first  
three  week s of treatment will be shipped in a batch to UPenn  from the U MB IDS. Once the 
subject has been rand omized, the UMB IDS  will provide medication for subsequent weeks of 
treatment in batches , as described below . The UMB IDS will track the number of starter kits 
dispensed at UPenn and will replenish them to ensure that medication is available for ongoing 
enrollment.  All clinical staff members directly involved with the assessment of subjects will 
always be blind to the medication condition.  These procedures have been designed to avoid 
delay.  
5.[ADDRESS_1273016] Compliance Monitoring  
 Compliance with ondansetron will be assessed using the methods below:  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38950] : An account of dispensed and returned study  drug will be kept at the study  
center for each subject.  Subject reports of discrepancies (e.g., lost or discarded capsules ) will 
be documented in the case report form (CRF).  
 Presence of urinary riboflavin (an i nternal tracer for assessing medication compliance):  
Both the active and placebo drug will be packaged with the internal tracer, 12.[ADDRESS_1273017] the formulation with a low -riboflavin formulation. Urine  samples will be 
collected at each visit following the initiation of medication to measure riboflavin amounts in 
urine. Percentage of optical density of riboflavin in samples will be compared to that of a control 
sample containing a set amount of riboflavin to objectively determine medication compliance . 
Optical densities will be meas ured using a urinary fluorescence assay to be conducted at UMB 
using frozen urine samples sent from both sites.  
 Dosing Diary:  The clinician will use a calendar -based TLFB -style technique  to elicit this  
information , which increases precision for the exact times of medication ingestion.   
 BBCET: Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET) . Subjects in  
both medication groups will receive BBCET ( described  below). BBCET emphasizes maintaining 
compli ance and avoiding early discontinuation of the medication. Adverse events are monitored 
and protocol -permitted remedies or over -the-counter medications are provided if necessary to 
deal with them.

5.[ADDRESS_1273020] adequate medication to continue the prescribed regimen if a visit needs to be rescheduled. 
Half of the participants will receive an inactive placebo. Placebo will be opaque , gelatin capsules 
of the same size, color, and shape packaged with cornstarch. All capsules (active and placebo) 
will be packaged with 12.[ADDRESS_1273021] is in the 
ondansetron  or placebo group until the decision to break the study blind is determined at the 
end of the study (after study database lock). Codes linking randomization numb er for each 
subject to actual treatment will be secured in a sealed, opaque envelope and maintained in a 
locked drawer in the IDS. Research subjects will be given the emergency contact [CONTACT_906793]. See section 8.4 (Un blinding Procedures) for a 
description of the process for unblinding a study subject.   
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing , and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies :   
 There is no industry sponsor for this study. The  UMB  School of will prepare  the study 
medication using commercially available product.  The IDS will dispense coded, blinded study 
drug kits to the research coordinator  at each site .  Starter kits containing three weeks of study 
medication will be following by [CONTACT_906794] , 2 of which will contain 4 weeks of study 
medication ( for week 4 -7 and for weeks 8 -11)and one of which will contain 5 weeks of study 
medication (for weeks 12 -16). Each  kit will contain medication divided into weekly prescriptions 
that contain 9 days of medicati on (i.e., an extra two days of medication (i.e., 4 capsules) to 
ensure that subjects have adequate medication to continue the prescribed regimen if a visit 
needs to be rescheduled ).   The research coordinator will maintain 100% d rug accountability at 
the c linic for the duration of the study. The research coordinator will document all medication 
using a drug accountability log  to track the study medication from time it leaves the  IDS until the 
time that it is returned to the IDS for reconciliation and dispos al.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 28 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  5.9.2  Storage  
 Study drug will be stored at the IDS at controlled r oom temperature (36 -86 F). Study 
drug kits dispensed from the UMB IDS to the clinic s at UPenn and UMB  will be stored in a 
locked cabinet in a room that is temperature controlled and double locked until dispensed. Any 
returned study medication will also be kept under locked condition s until returned to the UMB 
IDS for disposal.  
5.9.[ADDRESS_1273022] until the next scheduled 
visit (with two days of additional medi cation to ensure that the subject has adequate medication 
if the appointment is  not scheduled for the exact number of weeks or has to be rescheduled).  
All clinical staff members directly involved with the assessment of subjects are always blind to 
the med ication condition. These procedures have been  designed  to avoid delay. The 
randomization and assignment of eligible subjects into groups will be conducted at by [CONTACT_906795]. All participants and other investigat ors will 
be blinded.  
 The study nurse and study coordinator will maintain a dispensing record , documenting 
the amount of medication dispensed to the subject, the amount returned, and the amount taken. 
A log will be used to document the amount of study drug returned to the IDS and the date it was 
returned.  
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
 A final reconciliation of all remaining study medication will be made at the end of the 
study. All unused kits and medications dispense d and later returned by [CONTACT_906796], which  will be responsible for the disposal/  destruction of all unused 
study medication. The study coordinator will reconcile all remaining study medication for each 
subject as they compl ete the study and return all unused study medication a nd empty 
medication bottles to the UMB IDS for reconciliation in batches on a quarterly basis.  All 
attempts will be made to collect the study medication and bottles from subjects at the end of the 
study and during follow -up sessions as needed.  
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Initial Telephone Screen ( approximately 20 minutes)  
Subjects will be recruited through local advertisements  in print and broadcast media, through 
leaflets and posters distributed throughout the Greater Baltimore regions, and by [CONTACT_906797] -
line and through social media , and by [CONTACT_906798] ( as described in 
section 4.1) . Subjects who expre ss interest by [CONTACT_906799] a telephone screening interview. Prior to eliciting any information, w e will describe 
the nature of the study, including the number of visits to the center, subject protectio ns and 
confidentiality. If the caller is still interested, we will obtain oral consent for the phone screening. 
Screening questions cover general health, psychiatric history and alcohol consumption. If , in 
consultation with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_28678],  we determine  that the applicant is 
eligible based on this screening, s/he will be invited to come to the clinic for an in -person screen 
visit.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 29 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  6.2   S creen Visit  (V0-1; Study  Week -1)  
 This visit is designed for genetic screening to allow s tratification on the tested genotypes 
Upon arriving to the visit, which will be conducted at the CNC in Columbia, MD,  subjects will be 
asked to show legal photo iden tification and to provide informed consent. They will then 
undergo  a breathalyzer test to e nsure a breath alcoho l concentration (B rAC) of 0.00%, which  
will be used to assess alcohol intoxication at every visit.  The allowable alcohol concentration at 
all visits following the screening visit is less or equal to 0.02.  The informed consent will be 
considered valid and no assessments will be performed at the screening or any subsequent visit 
unles s subjects have BrAC readings of 0.00%  
 If the subject attends the clinic and records a B rAC greater than this level, the study staff 
will encourage the sub ject to wait in the clinic for a sufficient time to permit testing.  If a subject 
coming to the UMB site  records a BrAC level >0.02 mg/dl , and does not agree to wait, or it is 
impractical for the subject to wait until the B rAC falls to the desired level f or testing, he or she 
should be advised not to leave until the B rAC is below the legal level.  If the subject insists on 
leaving at a level at or above the legal limit, this should be documented in the appropriate 
section of the CRF.  The investigator shou ld make a reasonable effort to reach the subject after 
he or she leaves the clinic to ascertain his or her safety and to encourage him or her  to attend 
the next clinic visit.    
 The screening visit can be done in one or more visits , depending on participa nt’s 
availability and co nvenience . If necessary, because of technical issues preventing a valid test or 
for clinical considerations, we will allow repeating any screening clinical laboratory test at least 
twice (at the same or future visit).

6.6. Safety F ollow -up Visit (Week 20) 
At this visit,  a BrAC and vital signs will be measured and study personnel will assess  persistent 
adverse events following the cessation of study medication. If the subject discontinues the study 
early, the visit can be by [CONTACT_97535] e unless an SAE occurred during the study and  it has not 
been fully resolved by [CONTACT_10585] 16.  Individuals who complete the study medication period will be 
invited to give an optional blood draw for mRNA and miRNA expression studies.       
                   6.7.   Assessments  
 Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  
Disorders , 4th Edition  (SCID -IV).  Diagnosis by [CONTACT_906800] -IV 
diagnoses (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) except for the alcohol use disorder  
diagnosis, which will be based on  the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders  (DSM -5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).  For the AUD diagnosis, we 
will adapt  the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders  (SCID -IV) (First, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Gibbon, & Williams, 1994),  to ensure that subjects meet at 
least two of the 11 diagnostic criteri a. The SCID will also be used to exclude subjects  with 
exclusionary psychiatric  diagnoses.  
 The Semi -Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and A lcoholism (SSADDA). The 
SSADDA is a polydiagnostic instrument developed for use in genetic studies of alcohol  
and drug dependence. Because the SCID -IV does not assess nicotine dependence, the 
Nicotine dependence module of SSADDA interview will be used to characterize the 
study sample with respect to a DSM -IV diagnosis of nicotine independence.  
 Alcohol Dependence Scale  (ADS total score) . The ADS was designed to provide a  
quantitative measure of the severity of alcohol dependence consistent with the concept of the 
alcohol dependence syndrome.  The Alcohol Dependence Scale is a rater -administered, 25 -
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 34 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  item questionnaire covering alcohol withdrawal symptoms, impaired control over drinking, 
awareness of a compulsion to drink, increased tolerance to alcohol, and drink seeking behavior.  
The ADS will be administered by a trained member of the research team.  
 The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)  will be used to screen potential   
study participants for alcohol use and related problems.  The AUDIT is a [ADDRESS_1273028] validity  (Babor, de la Fuente, Saunders, & Grant, 1992) , and reliability (Cronbach’s 
alphas ranging from 0.77 to 0.83)  (Bohn, Babor, & Kranzl er, 1995) .  The AUDIT will be 
administered at the site as part of the telephone screening interview.  
 The Timeline Follow -back (TLFB) method  to quantify alcohol consumption will be   
administered at every study visit by a trained member of the study team. Th e TLFB is a daily 
calendar for alcohol consumption that employs memory aids, such as a calendar, to help 
subjects provide retrospective estimates of their daily drinking as the number of standard drinks 
for each day. A day is defined as a [ADDRESS_1273029] arting at 6.00 a.m. and ending at 6.00 a.m. 
the following morning. A month is a period of 28 consecutive days.  Th e TLFB can be completed 
in a reasonable length of time (approximately 10 -15 min) and has been used extensively in 
pharmacotherapy trials for a lcohol dependence. At the Baseline Visit, the TLFB will be used to 
measure alcohol consumption for the prior [ADDRESS_1273030] attends Visit 6 (Week 4), does not attend 
Visit 7 (Week 5) and returns to the study center for Visit 8 (Week 6), the TLFB administered at 
Visit [ADDRESS_1273031] refuses to participate in an on -site study visit, the 
study center may administer the TLFB via phone, at Week  20 to obtain the missing data.  
 Mini International Psychiatric Interview (MINI)  Suicide Risk Assessment Scale  (Module 
B) is a subscale of the MINI neuropsychiatric interview. It has been shown to help 
identify patients at risk for self -harm.  
 Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)  is a [ADDRESS_1273032] drinking.  
 Revised Clinical Institute Withd rawal Assessment for Alcohol scale  (CIWA -Ar)  
consists of 10 items, 9 of which (nausea and vomiting, tremo r, paroxysmal sweats, anxiety, 
agitation, tactile disturbances, auditory disturbances, visual disturbances, headache , fullness in 
head) are rated on a scale of from 0 to 7. The 10th item (orientation and clouding of sensorium) 
is rated on a scale of from [ADDRESS_1273033] be administer ed by [CONTACT_906801].  The research team member who administer s the CIWA -Ar 
assessment will be  trained in the scoring conventions for the scale.  
 Clinical Global Impression -Improvement Scale  (CGI -I The CGI -I is rated on a 7 -point  
scale: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 
5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; or 7=v ery much worse and permits a global evaluation of 
the subject’s improvement (or worsening) over time. The clinician is required to assess the 
subject's condition relative to baseline at every study visit. In all cases, the assessment should 
be made indepen dent of whether the rater believes the improvement is drug -related or not. CGI -
1 will be administered by [CONTACT_906802], after 
training. Due to the simplicity of the scale, the CGI will be used in the origin al English version.    
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 35 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018   Clinical Global Impression -Severity Scale  (CGI -S)  The CGI -S assesses the  
clinician's impression of the subject's current clinical condition, and is rated on a 7 -point scale: 
1= normal, not at all ill; 2= borderline ill; 3= mildly il l; 4= moderately ill; 5= markedly ill; 6= 
severely ill; 7= among the most extremely ill subjects. The clinician should use his/her total 
clinical experience with this subject population and rate the current severity of the subject's 
clinical condition on a  7-point scale. CGI -S will be administered by [CONTACT_906803], qualified member of the research team . Short Index of problems (SIP)  is a 15-item self -
report instrument  
that will be administered at the screening, baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12and Week 16 
(End of Study) visits.  The SIP measures  specific and direct harmful consequences of drinking.  
Each item is assessed on a 3 -point scale ranging from “never or once or a fe w times” to “daily or 
almost every day.”  A lower score indicates fewer adverse consequences of drinking. The 
DrInC, which contains items that measure a wide range of alcohol -related problems (including 
alcohol dependence symptoms and medical, psychologica l, social, occupational, and legal 
problems), has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of alcohol -related problems.  The 
SIP is simpler to administer and, like the DrInC, has been shown to measure a single factor of 
alcohol -related problems.  
 Beck  Depression Inventory  (BDI)  The 21 -item BDI will be used to measure  
depressive symptoms. Questions focus on topi[INVESTIGATOR_906729], thoughts of suicide, sleep 
habits, and eating behaviors. The BDI will be used to assess the severity of any depressive 
symptom s, particularly suicidal risk.  The BDI will be administered at every study visit.  At 
screening/baseline, subjects with severe, untreated depression or who endorse suicidal intent 
will be excluded from the study and referred for treatment or immediate inte rvention.  At each 
post-baseline visit, the staff will review the findings on the BDI to ensure that the subject’s safety 
is not compromised by [CONTACT_906784].  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)  is a self -rated questionnaire assessing  
sleep quality and disturbances during a 1 -month period.  It contains 19 items that generate 7 
component scores on subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep 
efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime d ysfunction, all of which 
add up to a global score.  Because sleep disturbance is common in alcoholis m, recovery may 
be associated with improved sleep.  
 Other Drug Use questionnaire  is a brief self -report questionnaire on which the  
subject  is asked to list his/her  use of any prescribed or non -prescrib ed drug use occurring since 
the last study visit.  Upon its completion, a study staff member reviews the questionnaire and 
obtains details about any reported drug use.  
 RAND 12 -Item Health Surve y (SF -12), a self -report measure of life functioning in  
various domains.  It yields a n overall health -related quality of life  score and physical and mental 
health component  summary scales . 
 6.8  Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET)  
 Delivery of BBCET:  BBCET is  the psychosocial adjunct intervention for the study. A 
BBCET manual has been developed  by [CONTACT_906804] . A BBCET -trained staff member from 
UMB will train the BBCET provider(s) at the UP enn site and will meet monthly  by [CONTACT_906805].  BBCET sessions shall 
occur at every study visit  and will be delivered by a trained nurse or masters level clinician .  
All BBCET sessions will be audiotaped. Study staff will not use n ames or disclose PHI 
during the audio -taped sessions. Study staff will identify the subject by [CONTACT_906806] a secure server until reviewed by [CONTACT_464] (exclusively) and then 
deleted. The BBCET supervisors will rev iew 10% of these tapes to ensure adherence to its 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 36 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  uniform delivery. Including the pre -randomization and termination BBCET sessions, there  will be 
a total of 1 1 BBCET sessions for the 16-week trial. Each BBCET session lasts about 10 –[ADDRESS_1273034] visit and the ascertainment of adverse events. BBCET sessions 
focus on compliance with the medication and reinforce adherence to the protocol. BBCET 
sessions al so reinforce the importance of taking study medication and provide general 
motivation, encouragement, and support for continuing in treatment. BBCET provides  education 
on the negative effects of excessive alcohol use on physical and mental health. The rati onale for 
using the medication is discussed in simple language. Physical examination and laboratory 
results are discussed with each participant. BBCET helps subjects to overcome ambivalence, 
which may interfere with their  desire to change. Adherence to med ication and compliance with 
the protocol are praised and reinforced.  
BBCET emphasizes that alcohol dependence is a disease process that can be tackled 
by [CONTACT_906807]. BBCET mimics a naturalistic doctor/patient relationship 
in function  and duration and will  feel familiar to most participants. BBCET does not allow for the 
interpretation of feelings, psychological interpretations about the nature of alcohol dependence, 
or applying problem -solving techniques to matters other than medicatio n compliance. One 
hallmark of BBCET is that subjects set their target drinking goal for the next period at each 
session. BBCET can be more readily generalized than formal psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_906743]. General health care 
workers can  be trained to deliver it, thereby [CONTACT_906808]. BBCET has been used successfully in previous 
pharmacotherapy trials.  
BBCET is delivere d in 3 phases.  
In Phase 1  (Baseline and Weeks 1 –3), the BBCET provider builds rapport with the 
subject to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_906744], trust, and warmth, discusses medication effects, instructs on the 
importance of taking the medication regularly, provides a basic and easily understandable 
model of how the medicatio n(s) might work, addresses concerns about taking medication, 
adverse events, and compliance barriers with the subject in understandable terms, and clearly 
conveys his or her knowledge and experience with the pharmacotherapy of alcohol problems. 
The BBCET p rovider allows the subject to air prejudices, corrects any misconceptions (which 
may include “all or none” expectations), and provides a medication information sheet with an 
emergency contact [CONTACT_906809].  
In Phase 2  (Weeks 4 –10), the emphasis is on maintaining compliance and avoiding 
early discontinuation of the medication. Adverse events are monitored and protocol -permitted 
remedies or over -the-counter medications are provided if necessary to deal with them.  
In Phase 3  (Weeks 12 and 16 ), the BBCET provider and the subject discuss the 
subject’s experience throughout the study. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the subject will be offered referrals, and 
the termination v isit will take place.  
The BBCET provider will discuss plans regarding how to discontinue the medication and 
will provide a rationale of how the medication may have helped the participant to achieve his or 
her goal. It is expected that a significant provide r-subject relationship has been developed 
during the study, and care should be taken in the termination of this relationship.  
Subject Compliance with BBCET Administration: BBCET is the only allowed 
psychosocial treatment.  Subject participation in BBCET se ssions will be tracked.  Evidence of 
non-compliance could result in discontinuation of the subject from the study.   
Practitioner Adherence to BBCET : BBCET sessions will be audiotaped. A random 
selection of 10% of the tapes will be reviewed at each site to ensure adherence to the protocol. 
Recertification and/or retraining of those administering BBCET will be used to correct any 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1273035] (PSC) will be administered as an additional check on 
compliance.  
6.9  Genetic Evaluation  
Blood sample collection:  Two vaccutainer tubes containing ACD buffer (to prevent 
coagulation) will be used to collect a total of [ADDRESS_1273036] as shown in Table  1 .  All blood samples collected for DNA , mRNA and miRNA  
extraction will be processed and stored at 4 C to be sent t o [CONTACT_906825]’s laboratory at the 
UMB Institute for Genome Scien ces (IGS).  
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_906745] :  All genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_906746].  Genomic DNA will be extracted 
from whole blood samples using established procedures from [CONTACT_906825]’s previous work  
(Ait-Daoud et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2009 ).  
The 5 -HTTLPR genotypes LL, LS and SS and the rs25531 genotypes AA, AG and GG will be 
will be performed simultaneously using restriction fragment -length polymorphism (RFLP) 
method. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_906747] (listed below) will be performed with co mmercially 
available TaqMan® allelic discrimination assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, [LOCATION_004]). 
Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real -Time PCR system will be used for amplification and 
capture of the resulting florescent signals.  
 
 rs1042173 (TT, TG , and GG genotypes) in the 3′ -untranslated region of SLC6A4 that 
encodes the serotonin transporter;  
 rs1150226 (AA, AG and GG genotypes) in the 5′UTR of HTR3A gene that encodes 
subtype A of the serotonin -3 receptor;  
 rs1176713 (GG, GA and AA genotypes), a sy nonymous SNP in exon 9 of HTR3A 
gene that encodes subtype A of the serotonin -3 receptor;  
 rs17614942 (AA, AC and CC genotypes), an intron 8 SNP in HTR3B gene that 
encodes subtype B of the serotonin -3 receptor  
 rs1176744 (AA, AC, CC genotypes), an exon 5SNP i n HTR3B gene that encodes 
subtype B of the serotonin -3 receptor ( for UPENN site only)  
All samples will be genotyped in duplicate and any discrepancies will be repeated to ensure the 
accuracy of the procedure.  No results of genetic testing (including ance stry genetic panel, if 
done) will be provided to participants, even if they request it. A requesting participant will be 
reminded that the informed consent form stated that no genetic test results would be provided to 
participants.  
mRNA  and miRNA expression studies:  The total RNA extractions will be performed after 
completing the entire proposed study, using supplemental funding. Until then, the blood 
samples will be stored securely in -800C freezers. The genome -wide expression levels o f mRNA 
and miRNA in WBC (cellular mRNA and miRNA) as well as circulating miRNA in serum will be 
quantified with next generation sequencing based technologies available at the sequencing core 
of the IGS.

the subject with enough study medication to ensure the maint enance of  the daily dosage of 
study medication until the next scheduled visit as per the dosing schedule , either in person or  
via mail.  Subjects will be instructed to call the UPENN study staff at any time to discuss 
problems or concerns that they may have while participating in the study .  They  will be provided 
with phone numbers to contact [CONTACT_906810] a nd a pager  number for off -

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
  
For the 2 EA genotype groups discussed above  (section 3.1) , we are expecting that 61% of the 
EA sample will be in the responsive genotype strata and 29% of the EA sample will be in the 
non- responsive genotype strata based on prior studies5. Block  randomization will balance 
allocation of the 2 treatment conditions (within each racial group) with the responsive and non -
responsive  genotype strata. Hence, after 30 % dropout, the expected cell frequency for the 2 
treatment arms  for EAs  will each be 39 i n the responsive strata and 25 in the non -responsive 
strata. For two of the AA genotype groupi[INVESTIGATOR_906748] (section 3.1), we are expecting 
that the 5 -HTTLPR LALA group, which in the randomized sample is estimated to include 55 AAs 
subjects (i.e., ~30 % of the total randomized sample based on the frequency of the L ALA 
genotype in AAs)  and subjects with rs1042173*TT genotype (which is estimated to include 106 
subjects, i.e., 58% of AAs have the TT genotype) . Power analysis was done using the methods 
in Section 8.3 in Cohen  (1988) .  For the power calculations, we estimated that the effect size for 
reduction of D DD between the ondansetron and placebo groups in the responsive genotype 
group would be 0. 595.  Assuming an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1273039] whether ondansetron is better than placebo overall (i.e. regardless of 
genotype). For this comparison we expect to have 64 EA subjects in each tr eatment arm  and 64 
AA subjects in each treatment arm . With alpha= .05, we  have  power equal to .[ADDRESS_1273040] n=128 treatment -seeking alcohol dependent individuals who 
complete the 16 week trial  at each site . However, we will include all randomized subjects in the 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 39 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  main intent -to-treat analyses. Stratified r andomization will ensure  approximate  balance betw een 
the 2 treatment conditions ( ondansetron and placebo) within genotype strata  (as discussed 
above)   Group assignment will be achieved using a permuted block randomization 
procedure  that further  balances the treatment groups on  study site, race and gende r.  
Statisticians who will have no contact [CONTACT_906811].  Subjects also will receive Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment 
(BBCET) as their psychosocial adjunct weekly in weeks 1 –8 and then every 2 weeks in weeks 
8-16.  
 Descriptive summaries and group comparisons:   Data will be summarized for the 
primary and secondary outcome measures, demographics, and baseline characteristics.  
Generally, quantitative variables will be summarized with standard descriptive sta tistics (e.g., 
range, quartiles, means, and standard deviations), while frequency tables w ill summarize 
categorical variables.  Group comparison for quantitative variables will be done using standard 
two-sample t-tests or analysis of variance as appropriate.  Highly skewed variables may be 
transformed before inferential comparison, or non -param etric methods may be used.  Group 
comparison for categorical variables will be analyzed with two -sample proportional comparisons 
or chi -square tests as appropriate.  
 Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes:   The primary efficacy variable will be 
change from baseline in D DD.  Secondary outcome variables will include other measures of 
drinking —percent heavy drinking days  (PHDD)  and the percentage of days abstinent.  
Exploratory drinking outcomes will include the novel measure —percentage of subjects with no  
heavy drinking days  (Falk et al., 2010) , which presently is the standard identified by [CONTACT_906812].  
 The general approach to statistical analyses will be the same as that utilized in our 
previous studies  (Johnson et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2000) .  All randomized subjects will be 
included in the analysis using the intent -to-treat principle.  We will use a mixed -models 
approach, adjusting for baseline covariates (when significantly different  by [CONTACT_19313]) and the 
same drinking variables for baseline .  For the drinking variables, the baseline value is the 
average for the [ADDRESS_1273041] whether EA  subjects  who are treated with ondansetron will show fewer DDD than the 
corresponding placebo group overall (regardless of genotype ).  We also will explore the 
‘difference in differences’ hypothesis that the difference in DDD will be greater in the 
hypothesized res ponsive genotype group than the difference in the hypothesized non -
responsive genotype group, however the study is not powered for this.  The residuals from our 
analyses will be checked for normality by [CONTACT_906813] a histogram and against predicted 
outcomes.  Standard (i.e., square root or log) transformations will be employed to improve the 
distributions when required.   
 Before we conduct the analyses, the groups will be compared to verify balance on the 
age, gender, and drinking severity variables, as well as other important baseline demographics 
and clinical characteristics.  If, as expected, there are no significant group differences, these 
baseline and balanc ing variables will be dropped from further analyses.  Possible (though 
unexpected) group differences will be further examined and interpreted as to their clinical 
meaning and whether they may confound the interpretation of planned comparisons.  Since this 
is a simple factorial model, the interpretation of main effects and their interaction is 
straightforward.  Where there is a significant main effect for an independent variable with three 
or more levels or an interaction, post -hoc comparisons will be done.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1273042] for 
missing data.  If, however, there is a differential attrition rate (i.e., if dropout is informative), we 
shall consider other approaches (e.g., joint models of longi tudinal drinking outcome and time to 
dropout) to account for informative dropout to obtain valid results  (Liu, 2009; Wulfsohn & Tsiatis, 
1997) .  Statistics will be run using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  
 In secondary analyses we will conduct analyses similar to the main analyses only with 
change from baseline in number of heavy drinking days (HDDs) during the last [ADDRESS_1273043] a responders analysis on this 
secondary outcome with endpoint: no heavy drinking days over the last [ADDRESS_1273044] 8 weeks of treatment.  For this outcome we 
will use an ordinary logistic regression model to compare the trea tment groups in the whole 
sample and within the hypothesized responsive  genotype  adjusting for the same covariates as 
in the main model.  One additional alternative endpoint that we will examine is mean daily 
alcohol consumption (in standard drinks/day) ov er the last 4 weeks of the 16 -week treatment 
period.  This will be analyzed with ordinary linear regression for a continuous outcome.  
 As an exploratory procedure, we also will use the more advanced two -part random 
effects model  (Olsen & Schafer, 2001; Too ze, Grunwald, & Jones, 2002)  to analyze the daily 
drinking record.  This model can simultaneously characterize the frequency (odds of daily 
drinking being zero) and quantity (the number of drinks on a drinking day) of drinking.  It is more 
efficient and can tackle non -normality in th e drinking level.  We also will do trajectory analyses 
of different treatments over time to capture differences in drinking outcomes  (Chen et al., 2011) .  
Such an analysis is more clinically intuitive and could be more powerful than the analysis based 
on endpoints.  
 Furthermore, as an additional exploratory step to provide information on whether 
ondansetron treatment has differential efficacy for specific genotypes in a “relapse prevention” 
model rather than with the “currently drinking” approach, we will d o secondary analyses on 
those who quit drinking during the study to determine whether, and by [CONTACT_42621], these results 
differ from our primary analyses.  We will report and discuss these secondary analyses along 
with the primary approach in our publications .   
7.[ADDRESS_1273045] Population(s) for Analysis  
 The primary efficacy  analys is will be conducted with the intent -to-treat population 
consisting of all individuals who are randomized to treatment and take at least one dose of study 
medication.  This will require at least one post -randomization measurement of outcomes.  
Similarly, all safety evaluations will include all available subjects on whom any safety 
information is obtained.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects  or Others :  Any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 41 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018   Suggests tha t the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
An Adverse Event (AE):  is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens 
in severity during the course of th e study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded 
as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse 
events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE): Any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive  treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period :  The stud y period during which adverse events must be 
reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end 
of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_1273046] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition : A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  
A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or 
the character of  the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings : At screening, any clinically significant abnormality 
should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically 
significant findings/ab normalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event :  All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_436135], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to 
report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonabl y be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this stu dy.  The 
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1273047] that has 
participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values : A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an 
adverse event if any one of the following  conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and /or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706] : Any adverse event that results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66301] a serious 
adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be  documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201728].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmissions as judged by [CONTACT_405046].  
8.[ADDRESS_1273048] seek information on adverse 
events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adver se 
events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate 
adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should 
be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events 
that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final 
outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is consid ered to be 
possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page [ADDRESS_1273049] be reported are those that are:  
 related to study participation,  
 unexpected, and  
 serious or involve risks to subject s or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).   
 
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the 
time of the initial report includes:  
 Study identifier  
 Study Center  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset   Current status  
 Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
8.3.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
 Each study site will be responsible for reporting any  study -related unanticipated problem 
posing risk of harm to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse event,  and all other 
adverse  events  as required by [CONTACT_906814]/UPENN IRB sites (see sections 8. 3.2) to the study 
sponsor (NIAAA) and FDA. Both IRB sites will be notified of all reported events and outcomes at 
both sites .  The investigator will keep a copy of  these reports on file at the study site.   
 Within the following [ADDRESS_1273050] the  understanding of the event.  Significant new information on 
ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to both sites.  
      8.3.2. Investigator reporting: notifying the Institutional Review  
                Board  
 This section describes th e requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_906815]/ Penn faculty, affiliated with a UMB/ Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety 
reporting to the IRB. The Institutional Review Board s at UPenn and UMB  require expedited 
reporting of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that 
participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The IRB will not acknowledge safety 
reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do n ot meet the criteria outlined below.  The IRB 
requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 5 business  days from the 
time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
 Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -site or 
off-site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_237613]:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, 
any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent 
document and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts.)  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 44 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  AND 
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to 
be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)  
 
Reporting Process :  Unanticipa ted problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above 
will be reported to the UMB  IRB in CICERO under reportable new information within 5 business 
days.   
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_413724]’s study file.  
Reporting Deaths :  more rapid reporting requirements  
Deaths that occur during the course of a research study and that are:  
1) Unexpected; AND  
2) Related to the research study; AND  
3) When other participants are believed to be  at an increased risk of harm  
Must be reported to the IRB within 3 business days from the time the investigator becomes 
aware of the death.  
Other Reportable events:  For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the 
IRB: 
 Any adverse  experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause the spons or to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_85400].  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
 An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment 
than initially expected.  
 Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent 
than initial ly expected.  
 A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is 
of no therapeutic value.  
– Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
– Breach of confidentiality  
– Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
– Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believ es it is in the best interest of the subject to 
remain on the study.  
– Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
– Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintention al deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_341871], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
  
HP-00061575, Pharmacogenetic Treatments for Alcoholism  Page 45 
Version 11.1 09 -05-2018  8.3.3  Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA:   
The stud y sponsor is  required to r eport  certain study events in an expedited 
fashion to the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred 
to as IND safety reports. The following describes the safety reporting 
requirements by [CONTACT_28822]:  
   
 
 
– Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
– Within 15 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life -threatening  
-or- 
 a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit 
the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed 
reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest s a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, 
teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
Additional reporting requirements :  Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safe ty 
reports all previous reports concerning similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of 
the current event in light of the previous reports.  
Reporting Process :  Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative 
format. If supp lied as in a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted 
above at the beginning of section 8.3.  
8.3.4  Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators  
 It is the responsibility of the study sponsor to notify all participating inves tigators, in a 
written IND safety report, of any adverse event associated with the use of the drug that is both 
serious and unexpected, as well as any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a 
significant risk for human subjects.  Additionall y, sponsors are also required to identify in IND 
safety reports all previous reports concerning similar adverse events and to analyze the 
significance of the current event in light of the previous reports.  
8.[ADDRESS_1273051] lies with the study PI (or 
a designated co -investigator if a PI [INVESTIGATOR_125234]) and would be resorted to only in cases of 
anemergency when knowledge of the treatment arm investigational agent will influence clinical 
management.  
8.5 Medical Monitoring  
 It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344899]/her site.  This safety monitoring wil l include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of 
adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data 
and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_1273052]  
 The DSMB will include relevant experts at  UPenn.  The DSMB members wi ll include 
James McKay, Ph.D. (chair ), Kevin Lynch, Ph.D. ( biostatistician), Richard Feinn, Ph.D., David 
Metzger, Ph.D. , Daniel Weintraub, M.D., Deb Dunbar, MSN, CRNP , and Cynthia Clark, Ph.D.  
The DSMB will meet by [CONTACT_906816] a sum mary report from the principal investigator, ensuring  that 
policies on the identification and reporting of adverse events to the appropriate regulatory 
bodies, which can include the local IRB, the FDA, and the project officer at the NIH, have been 
implemen ted diligently and promptly.  Prompt and due diligence reporting of adverse events 
(i.e., within 24 hours during the week and on the next working day following a weekend) to the 
regulatory bodies remains the express duty of the principal investigator.  The  DSMB will retain 
the right to make independent representation to the regulatory bodies if there has been a failure 
or lapse in reporting by [CONTACT_458].  The DSMB also will have the capacity to 
instruct the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_906749] o r terminate pursuance of research if regulatory body 
guidelines are contravened.  The DSMB will provide regular independent reports to the IRB 
concerning the protection of human subjects in this study.  These DSMB procedures have been 
approved previously b y the NIH for our ongoing clinical studies.   
 
Frequency of data and safety monitoring reviews:  These investigators have extensive  
experience with clinical trials using pharmacotherapy for the treatment of substance abuse  and 
with the recruitment and retention of substance -dependent subjects.  In the past, such trials 
have been done with minimal risks to participants.  Therefore, the DSMP will include two items:  
The research members  at each site , including the PI, co -inves tigators, research nurses , and 
project coordinator s, will meet weekly to discuss progress on the study and to address any 
issues related to  the research procedures.  The DSMB  will meet annually and will generate a 
report that is sent to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_12758] .  The report will summarize the Board’s review of 
cumulative serious and unexpected adverse events  and any other concerns that may arise .

[ADDRESS_1273053] of 199 6 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will us e or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled study period.  
Records, filed in the IRB office, verify that all research project personnel have completed 
training in the protection of human research subjects in accordance with the guidelines of the 
U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services (DHHS) and the Office for Human Research 
Protection (OHRP).  The study staff (PI, Clinical research coordinator, etc.) will keep all study 
medical records (including any codes to de -identified data) under lock and key in a secure 
location, as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Only date and time of the research visit and lab specimen data will 
be placed in the client’s existing electronic medical record. All electronic data and files (e.g., 
database, spreadsheet, etc.) containing identifiable subject informat ion shall be password 
protected.  Any computer hosting such files shall have a BIOS password to prevent access by 
[CONTACT_50000]-authorized users.  If subject data are to be exchanged with others, the data will be coded. If 
identification is necessary, then the data w ill be encrypted while en route to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_906751] (≥ 128 bits for symmetric encryption (DES) and ≥ 1024 bits for 
asymmetric encryption (RSA).    
All data and blood specimens will be stored without direct identifiable informatio n, but will 
be identifiable via a linking code. The secured research records are labeled with code numbers 
only (names and other identifying information are kept separate from research records). Access 
to data is only given to staff members working on the study. Only staff members designated to 
handle or analyze study samples will have access to the samples and their storage. Coded 
blood samples are stored in clinic -specific refrigerators and freezers, which are located in 
secure rooms. As per routine in th e UPenn Center for Studies of Addiction ( CSA), all electronic 
files (e.g., database, spreadsheet) will be password protected. Any computer hosting such files 
will have a BIOS password to prevent access by [CONTACT_50000] -authorized users. Further information 
concerning  the CSA’s Data Management Unit (DMU) is provided below.   
Blood will be collected for DNA analysis.  The information derived from analysis of the 
subjects’ DNA will not be provided to the subject, since at the present time the existing 
preliminary genetic d ata for predicting response to ondansetron do not provide a basis for 
genetic counseling. Should that situation change over the course of the study, procedures will

the sample will forever be separated from all identifiers. These de -identified samples may be 
shared with other researchers and us ed in other projects. The lab procedures for storage 
include a passcode -protected locked room, and secure storage freezers.  All samples will be 
retained securely as per lab protocols.  
A certificate of confidentiality has been obtained for this study. The  following conditions 
apply to the protection provided under this certificate:  
(l) This certificate does not authorize the University of Maryland, Baltimore, School 
of Medicine, their contractors or cooperating agencies to refuse to reveal identifying 
information concerning research subjects if any of the following conditions exist:  
 
(a) The research subject (or, if he or she is legally incompetent, his or her guardian) 
consents in writing to disclosure of the subject's own identifying information;  
 
(b) Authorized personnel of  the [LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human 
Services request such information for an audit or program evaluation of the research project, 
or for an  investigation of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, School of Medicine, or their 
contractors or cooperating agencies in carrying out the research project;  
 
(c) Release is required by [CONTACT_574913], Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 
et seq.) or regulations promulgated  thereunder (Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations).  
 
(2) This certificate is issued with the expectation that there will be no disclosures of 
identifying characteristics of research subjects in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, 
administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to compel disclosure of the identifying 
characteristics of research subjects, except as provided for in paragraph (1), above.  
 
(3) The confidentiality certificate does not govern the voluntary disclosure of 
identifying characteristics of research subjects , but only protects su bjects from compelled 
disclosure of identifying characteristics.  Sponsors/investigators  are therefore not prevented 
from the voluntary disclosure of such matters as child abuse or a subject's threatened 
violence to self or others; however, the consent form  should indicate clearly  the 
investigators’  intention to make any such voluntary disclosures.  
 
(4) This certificate does not represent an endorsement of the research project by [CONTACT_21967], or the Food and Drug Administratio n.

9.[ADDRESS_1273055] entry data management system of the CSA’s 
DMU , with data  stored on secure servers located in the Perelman School of Medicine’s  Data 
Center. Interview data and self -report data from both UPenn and UMB will be  entered directly 
onto computers by [CONTACT_74562]/or patients under supervision by [CONTACT_3655].  A range of checks 
for the validity of responses (including field validation to ensure that no out -of-range or 
otherwise invalid responses are accepted), and form validat ion to ensure that logically 
impossible responses to different questions are not  accepted) are built into this entry 
process.  After entry, the research staff performs a brief review to ensure that the form has been 
completed.  On completion of this review , the technician will transmit the data (in 128 -bit 
encrypted form) over the Internet to the DMU data servers.   After a seri es of online reviews, the 
data are  archived on the servers.   Protected health information  will not be included in these 
research dat a.  Permission to modify the archived data  is limited to designated  DMU 
personnel .  Audit logs record any modification to the original entry.   Various levels of password 
protection , determined by [CONTACT_906819], [CONTACT_75294], will  allow different members of the 
research team access to the data.   Once the dataset is complete, it will be exported to the 
biostatistical group  for use in modeling.  
9.4 Records Retention  
 It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_1273056].  These 
documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  
In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as 
to when these documents no long er need to be retained.

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic debilitating immunologic disease characterized by [CONTACT_681285][INVESTIGATOR_681275], scaly skin plaques.  In most developed countries, the 
prevalence in adults is between approximately 1.5 and 5%.1  About 20% of patients have moderate to 
severe disease w ith a considerable negative impact on psychosocial and economic status.2,3  It is 
increasingly recognized that PsO is more than a superficial disease, with 30% of patients having joint 
involvement and a high correlation between PsO and obesity, diabetes, depression, metabolic 
syndrome, and cardiovascular risk exists.4,5
This study seeks to demonstrate that a significantly higher proportion of patients with moderate PsO 
treated with risan kizumab can achieve a high level of skin clearance ( ≥Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
[PASI] 90) compared to patients treated with apremilast providing a significant improvement in patient 
outcomes.
Evidence generated to date has demonstrated the benefit s of risankizumab compared to other 
advanced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681276], such as adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab in moderate to severe 
PsO.6-[ADDRESS_922501].
Risankizumab (Skyrizi™) has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe PsO and is 
currently being developed for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (Phase 3 
studies).  Risankizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobin (Ig) G1 subclass 
directed towards the p19 subunit of interleukin -23 (IL -23).  The antibody (Ab) has been engineered to 
reduce Fcγ receptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity.  Risankizumab binds 
with high affinity to human IL -23.
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus apremilast for the 
treatment of adult subjects with moderate plaque PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy.  In 
addition, the study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching to risankizumab versus 
continuing on apremilast for subjects with moderate plaque PsO who do not achieve ≥75% reduction 
from Baseline in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 75) after [ADDRESS_922502] version of the 
Investigator's Brochure (IB).8
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
In risankizumab studies in patients with PsO, the majority of subjects receiving risankizumab achieve d 
90% improvement of their disease and risankizumab was well -tolerated.  As with many 
immune -modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function, resulting in a risk of infection.  
This will be monitored by [CONTACT_82644] (AEs) dur ing the treatment and observation 
Page 8 of 98Page 8 of 98 
STUDY M20 -326  |  Version 2.0  |  EudraCT 2020- 005512- [ADDRESS_922503].
Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON® -TB (or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] 
equivalent)/tuberculosis (TB) skin test result for TB must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.1of 
this protocol.  IL -23 inhibition is not known to increase the risk of TB infection or impair the response to 
TB infection in animal models.10,11  Subjects with positive QuantiFERON -TB testing (or IGRA 
equivalent)/TB skin test who have latent TB (defined by [CONTACT_13144]) are not required to be treated 
(unless recommended by [CONTACT_82646]) with TB prophylaxis prior to 
receiving risankizumab but should be carefully monitored for any sign of TB reactivation.
Published literature indicates that inhibition of IL -[ADDRESS_922504] of IL -23 p19 inhibition in animal models, both for pre -existing and tumor -induction 
models.15  While there is not enough clinical information at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with 
risankizumab, this risk is considered small.
Although rare, a potential for hepatic AEs is under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_23274].  
Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow -up of laboratory alterations in 
selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety.
Increases in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events, including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular 
accident, and cardiovascular death, reported initially with anti- IL-12/[ADDRESS_922505] 
not been observed in longer term studies with risankizumab.  While the likelihood of increased MACE is 
small, all suspected cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this s tudy 
will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_82647] (CAC).  The committee will 
remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.2).
Local reactions to subcutaneously administered biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82623], swelling, 
or induration at the injection site.  Manifestations of systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include 
anaphylaxis, generalized urti caria , hypotension, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  Both local and systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions are readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard 
medical treatment.  Subjects will be closely monitored during study drug administrat ion.  An independent 
Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate observed systemic hypersensitivity and 
anaphylactic events.  The AAC will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.3).
In conclusion, the benefit -risk profile of risankizumab is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical 
development.16  Based on data from the integrated safety analyses, risankizumab is safe and well -
tolerated and demonstrates a favorable benefit -risk profile.

immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624] -[ADDRESS_922507].
Primary Efficacy Objective
The primary efficacy objective in Period A is to demonstrate a higher rate of a) PASI 90 (defined as ≥90% 
reduction from Baselin e in PASI) and b) sPGA [ADDRESS_922508] based on Intent to Treat 
(ITT) Population in Period A (ITT_A), which consists of all randomized subjects .
The hypotheses corresponding to the co -primary endpoints in Period A are:
The proportion of subjects achieving PASI 90 in the risankizumab (RZB) group is greater than 
that in the APR group at Week 16, among the ITT_A Population.
The proportion of subjects achieving sPGA [ADDRESS_922509] (APR) group at Week 16, among 
the ITT_A Population.
The primary efficacy objective in Period B is to demonstrate a highe r rate of PASI 90 after switching the 
treatment at Week 16 from APR to RZB for 36 weeks (APR/RZB) when compared to continuing with APR 
(APR/APR) based on the Intent to Treat Population in Period B for Week 16 APR -PASI75NRs (ITT_B_NR), 
which consists of sub jects who are randomized to APR at Baseline, fail to achieve PASI 75 at Week 16, 
and are re -randomized.
The hypothesis corresponding to the primary endpoint in Period B is:
The proportion of APR -PASI75NR subjects achieving PASI 90 in the APR/RZB group is g reater 
than that in the APR/APR group at Week 52, among the ITT_B_NR Population.

in Section 3.3below.
The hypothesis corresponding to the ranked and only seconda ry endpoint in Period A is:
The proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 in the RZB group is greater than that in the APR 
group at Week 16, among the ITT_A Population.
The key secondary efficacy objectives in Period B are to demonstrate higher efficacy of treatment with 
APR/RZB when compared to APR/APR among APR -PASI75NRs, with respect to the key secondary 
endpoints in a ranked order in Period B, as specified in Section 3.3below.
The hypotheses corresponding to the ranked secondary endpoints in Period B are:
The proportion of APR -PASI75NR subjects achieving PASI 75 in the APR/RZB group is greater 
than that in the APR/APR group at Week 52, among the IT T_B_NR Population.
The proportion of APR -PASI75NR subjects achieving sPGA [ADDRESS_922511] 2 -grade 
improvement from Baseline in the APR/RZB group is greater than that in the APR/APR group at 
Week 52, among the ITT_B_NR Population.
Estimands Correspond ing to the Primary and Ranked Secondary Endpoints
The estimand corresponding to each of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints in Period A is 
defined using composite variable strategy as follows:
Difference in the proportion of subjects achieving the c orresponding endpoint at Week 16, 
without receiving alternative PsO treatment, regardless of premature discontinuation of study 
drug, in the RZB group in comparison with the APR group among the ITT_A population.
The estimand corresponding to each of the p rimary and ranked secondary endpoints in Period B is 
defined using composite variable strategy:
Difference in the proportion of subjects achieving the corresponding endpoint at Week 52 
without satisfying the rescue criteria or receiving the rescue medicati on, and without receiving 
alternative PsO treatment, regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug in the 
APR/RZB group in comparison with the APR/APR group among the ITT_B_NR population.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].treatment at the end of the study, the follow -up phone call for safety will be conducted approximately 
20 weeks (140 days) after administration of the last dose of risankizumab (i.e., Week [ADDRESS_922516] to 
risankizumab) or approximately 4 weeks (28 days) after the last dose of apremilast (for subjects who 
remain on the APR arm after re -randomization).
The 52 -week treatment duration includes Period A and Period B:
Period A (Baseline to Week 16):  Eligible subjects will be centrally randomized at the Baseline 
(Day 1) visit in a 1:2 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg as a single subcutaneous (SC) 
injection (Arm 1) or apremilast 30 mg orally twice daily (BID) (Arm 2).  The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_681288] ( ≤100 kg, > 100 kg) and prior exposure to any systemic 
and/or biologic treatment for PsO (0, ≥1).  Study drug administration for apremilast will occur 
beginning at Baseline (Day 1) based on the dose titration schedul e from Day 1toDay 5 and will 
continue with 30 mg BID until the day prior to the Week 16 visit where re -randomization will 
occur.  Study drug administration for risankizumab will occur at Baseline (Day 1) and Week 4.  
The final efficacy evaluation for Per iod A will take place at Week 16.
Period B (Week 16 to Week 52):  Subjects initially randomized to risankizumab (Arm 1) will 
continue to receive risankizumab [ADDRESS_922517] (Arm 2) will be re -randomized at the Week 16 visit in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg as a single SC injection at Weeks 16, 20, 32, 
and 44 (Arm 2a) or apremilast 30 mg orally BID up to Week 52 (Arm 2b).  Rerandomization will 
be strati fied by [CONTACT_47736] 75 response (responder, non -responder) at Week 16.  Rescue risankizumab 
will be offered to subjects who are re -randomized to apremilast (Arm 2b) and are PASI 50 non -
responders at Week 28 (Arm 3a; rescue risankizumab will be administered at Wee ks 28, 32, and 
44) or Week 40 (Arm 3b; rescue risankizumab will be administered at Weeks 40 and 44).  The 
final efficacy evaluation will take place at Week 52.

Male or female subjects with a dia gnosis of moderate chronic plaque PsO (with or without PsA) for at 
least [ADDRESS_922520] moderate chronic plaque PsO as defined by [CONTACT_47735] ≥ 10% and ≤ 15%, PASI 
≥12, and sPGA = 3 (moderate) based on a 5 -point scale (0 to 4) at Screening and the Baseline Visit.  The 
selection criteria relating to safety guarantee that subjects enrolled can safely be treated with 
risankizumab or apremilast based on the current knowledge of these drugs.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The selected dose of [ADDRESS_922521] labeling for 
the treatment of plaque PsO.
Blinded Efficacy Assessor
A qualified physician (may be a non -dermatologist) or designee (may be a non -physician) from the site 
will be responsible for performing the effica cy assessments, including PASI, BSA, and sPGA at all 
appropriate study visits ( Table 1).  The site will make every attempt to have the same qualified phy sician 
or designee perform these assessments throughout the study for each subject.  The efficacy assessor 
must remain blinded to patient's treatment, clinical laboratory results, and all subject safety data during 
the course of the study.  The efficacy as sessor will not view or discuss any subject specific safety data 
with the investigators or any other site personnel, with the exception of the dermatologic safety findings 
requiring urgent medical attention.  The efficacy assessor therefore cannot be the P rincipal Investigator.  
The efficacy assessor will not access patient's electronic case report form (eCRF) and will document the 
dermatologic assessments and potential dermatologic safety findings on paper worksheets that will be 
filed as source in the pat ient's record.  It is recommended that each study site has a designated back -up 
for the efficacy assessor.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Study treatment duration includes Period A and Period B :
Period A (Baseline to Week 16):  Eligible subjects will be centrally randomized at the Baseline 
(Day 1) visit in a 1:2 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg as a single SC injection (Arm 1) 
or apremilast orally with a dose titration from Day 1 to Day 5 and continuing with 30 mg BID 
until the day prior to Week 16 (Arm 2).  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_681293] ( ≤100 kg, > 100 kg) and prior exposure to any systemic and/or biologic treatment for 
PsO (0, ≥ 1).
Period B (Week 16 to Week 52):  Subjects initially randomized to apremilast (Arm 2) will be 
rerandomized at the Week 16 visit in a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg as a 
single SC injection (Arm 2a) or apremilast 30 mg orally BID (Arm 2b).  Rerandomization will b e 
stratified by [CONTACT_47736] 75 response (responder, non -responder) at Week 16.  Rescue risankizumab 
will be offered for subjects who are re -randomized to the apremilast arm and are PASI 50 non -
responders at Week 28 (Arm 3a) or Week 40 (Arm 3b).
This is an open -label study; however, the efficacy assessor will remain blinded to each subject's 
treatment, clinical laboratory results, and all subject safety data during the course of the study.
In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of study drug 
treatment is required for the efficacy assessor, reasonable efforts must be made to contact [CONTACT_681294].
The date and reason that the efficacy assessor's blind was broken must be recorded in the source 
documentatio n and eCRF, as applicable.
5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events:  Study Drug
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or d isease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in dis continuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.   All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance as an SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of 
the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_922555] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681279]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threaten ing, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event along with any suspec ted transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product if no other serious criterion 
is applicable.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of risankizumab or apremilast administration until 140 days (20 weeks) 
after discontinuation of risankizumab administr ation or [ADDRESS_922556].   After

procedure -related serious and nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the 
study -specific informed consent.   If a subject prem aturely discontinues study participation and begins 
commercially available risankizumab (Sky rizi)or apremilast (Otezla) all adverse events reported by 
[CONTACT_681295], will be captured as postmarketing reports.  The follow -up phone
call following the last dose of risankizumab during the study will not occur for subjects who begin 
commercially available risankizumab or apremilast .
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above.
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information [RSI]), and meets one of the above serious criteria.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Areas of Safety Interest/Safety Topi[INVESTIGATOR_681280], especially opportunistic infections, are a potential risk with immunomodulators.  Subjects will 
be screened and monitored throughout the study for Areas of Safety interest (ASI)/Safety Topi[INVESTIGATOR_681281].  Screening procedures are outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D).  In consideration of 
the ASI, the following supplemental eCRF(s) must be completed if AEs in any of the following areas are

circumstances:
Psychiatric disorders :  If subjects suffered from new or worsening psychiatric symptoms, or 
suicidal ideation or suicida l attempt is identified, it is recommended to discontinue treatment 
with apremilast.
Diarrhea, nausea ,and vomiting: If patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, 
discontinuation of treatment with apremilast may be considered .
Weight decrease: If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, evaluate weight loss 
and according to outcomes of the assessment, consider discontinuation of apremilast .
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
Adverse events must be graded to the 5 criteria described in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0.19
Grades:  Grade refers to the severity of the AE.  The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with un ique 
clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this guideline:
Grade 1 (Mild); asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.
Grade 2 (Moderate); minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.
Grade 3 (Severe); medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681282]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living.
Grade 4 (Severe); Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Grade 5 (Severe); Death related to AE
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relation ship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal rel ationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_922558] be

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered an SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
6.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee
An independent adjudication committee will adjudicate all observed cardio -and cerebro -vascular events 
and will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The events that are adjudicated and the adjudication 
process will be detailed in the CAC Charter.  Dedicated eCRFs will be used as outlined in Table 3.
In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_82656].
6.3 Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee
While no concerns with anaphylaxis/systemic hypersensitivity have been identified with the use of 
risankizumab, the sponsor has established an independent, blinded, expert committee to adjudicate 
events of anaphylaxis based on pre -specified definitions.  This independent external Anaphylaxis 
Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded 
to treatment allocation.  The event terms to be adjudicated and the adjudication process are detailed in 
the AAC Charter.  A suppleme ntal Hypersensitivity Reactions Signs and Symptoms eCRF will be used to 
collect information pertinent to the events.  In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_82657].
If a suspected systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs at th e investigative site, in addition to testing 
tryptase and histamine levels, PK, and antidrug antibody (ADA)/neutralizing antibody (nAb) samples 
should also be collected.  If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis is observed or 
reported w hile the subject is not at the investigative site, every effort should be made to obtain tryptase 
and histamine levels from the treating facility to help better characterize the diagnosis.
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE

STUDY M20 -326  |  Version 2.0  |  EudraCT 2020- 005512- [ADDRESS_922563] dose of rescue 
risankizumab.
A TEAE during the administration of risankizumab (i.e., among the ALL_RZB Population) is defined as any 
AE with an onset date on or after the first dose of RZB and within [ADDRESS_922564] dose of RZB.
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term, by [CONTACT_926], and 
by [CONTACT_681296].   Summaries (including percentages and 
events per 100 PYs) of SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will be provided as 
well. Pre-treatment SAEs will be summarized separately.
For selected lab parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory value that is above Grade 3 of 
Common Toxicity Criteria will be provided. Mean change in laboratory and vital signs variables will be
summarized. Additional details for the safety analysis are pro vided in the SAP .
7.6 Interim Analysis
No interim analysis is planned for this study.
7.7 Overall Type I Error Control
Overall type -I error for Period A will be controlled by [CONTACT_681297] -primary endpoints, followed by [CONTACT_681298], in a hierarchical order as described in Section 3.2and Section 3.3.
Overall type -I error for Period B will be controlled by [CONTACT_681299], followed by [CONTACT_681300], in a hierarchical order as described in Section 3.2and Section 3.3.
7.8 Sample Size Determination
This study plans to enroll a total of N = [ADDRESS_922565] to the co -primary endpoints in Period A, as well as 
between APR/RZB and APR/APR with respect to the primary endpoint in Period B:
Assuming that 50% of APR- PASI75NR subjects in the APR/RZB group and 20% of APR -PASI75NR 
subjects in the APR/APR group will achieve PASI 90 at Week 52 in Period B, the sample size of 
120 re -randomized APR- PASI75NR subjects (60 subjects per group) will have more than 90%
power to detect the treatment difference between APR/RZB and APR/APR, using a Chi -square 
test with a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05.
Assuming 55% of subjects initially randomized to APR will be re -randomized at Week 16 under 
the APR- PASI75NR (as defin ed by [CONTACT_248165] 75 response at Week 16) stratum, the total sample 
size for the initial APR group is 120/55% = 220.  Assuming the treatment difference is at least 
40% with respect to the co -primary endpoints of PASI 90 and sPGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16 in 
Period A, the total sample size of N = 330 subjects (RZB:  110, APR:  220) will also provide more

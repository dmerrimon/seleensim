Plas

, 
P

Although malaria is 
preventable with chemoprophylaxis and 
completely 
curable with early 
intervention
, 
drug 
treatment is not readily accessible 
in many parts of the world
.  Additionally, 
the use of 
antimalarial
 
drugs 
over time 
has been associat
ed with the emergence of drug

resistant strains
. 
 
Lack of compliance with preventive drug treatment by [CONTACT_52591]. 
 
The world’s first malaria vaccine,

(Mosquirix™)
,
 
a recomb

was approved for use by

. 
 
Therefore, the development 
of a safe and
 
more
 
effective malaria vaccine 
is an urgent priority and may t
ake many additional 
years.  Alternatively, the use of
 
antibodies 
for passive prevention of malaria provides a new and 
more immediate approach for malaria prevention that, if successful, would 
have a major impact 
on improving public health worldwide.
 
 
Recen
t development of highly potent human monoclonal 
antibodies that have changes made to improve their duration 
in vivo
 
and protect in different pre

L9LS
 
Development
 
The Vacci
ne Research Center (VRC),
 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
(NIAID), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) 
has
 
been investigating broadly
-
neutralizing human 
monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) targeted at a variety of pathogens that may be util
ized in clinical 
applications including preventive and therapeutic measures.  In the case of malaria, 
prevention

season control and elimination campaigns in endemi
c areas.
 
L9LS (VRC

MALMAB0114

-
AB) is the second PfCSP
-
specific mAb the VRC plans to 
pursue in clinical development. L9
,
 
the wild
-
type parent of L9LS, was isolated by [CONTACT_52594]
-
reactive memory B cells obtained from 
a subject immunized with 
a radi
ation
-
attenuated 
PfSPZ 
malaria vaccine in the 
VRC 314 clinical trial
 
(

)
 
using a junctional epi[INVESTIGATOR_52553] “CIS43

When
 
compared
 
to
 
a
 
published
 
panel
 
of
 
protective
 
human
 
PfCSP
 
mAbs, L9
 
protected m
ice against intravenous and mosquito 
bite SPZ challenge, and demonstrated the
 
lowest effective dose (ED)80 and effective 
concentration (EC)80 values (325.7 µg and 145.1 
µg/mL, respectively) of any mAb evaluated, 
including CIS43LS (685.92 µg and 363.93 µg/m
L,
 
respectively)
 
[

]
.
 
The unique preference of 
L9 for NPNV motifs was further underscored by [CONTACT_52595]
 
L9 for the NPNV motifs found in 
L9LS
 
in
 
Healthy Adults

rPfCSP. As 100% of known 
Pf 
field isolates have one or more
 
NVDP
 
motifs,
 
these
 
data suggest
 
that
 
L9 should
 
bind
 
all circulating strains
 
of malaria
[

]
.
 
L9 was modified with the previously
-
described Fc
-
region LS mutatio
n (L9LS) to increase
 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding and consequent antibody half
-
life [
2
-
5
]. 
Immune 
protection
 
and
 
half
-
life data acquired with L9 and L9LS identify L9LS as a promising clinical candidate for 
passive
 
mala
ria prophylaxis
.
 
1.1.2.
 
Rationale for 
Study
 
Design
 
This phase I trial will evaluate L9LS 
safety and PK 
at doses 1, 5 and 20 mg/kg IV
,
  
5 mg/kg SC
, 
and 5 mg/kg IM
. The study will allow 
for the achievement of
 
a range of antibody concentrations 
in vivo for determining a protective 
L9LS titer in CHMI. Because the safety and potential 
therapeutic range of this mAb is unknown, dose selection was informed by [CONTACT_105]
-
 
clinical PK data 
in non
-
human primates (NHP) compari
ng L9 and L9LS, historical dose ranges evaluated in 
clinical trials of other mAbs developed by [CONTACT_33807] (e.g., VRC07
-
523LS [IND133027] and 
N6LS [IND 134081]), and prior clinical experience in healthy adults with anti
-
malaria mAb 
CIS43LS (VRC 612 [NCT0420633
2] conducted under IND 142632
 
[
7
]
) where recipi[INVESTIGATOR_52555] 
[ADDRESS_55777] administration. The lack of malaria infection in participants who received a 20 or 40 
mg/kg IV dose of CIS43LS prevented the planned regression analysis to identify a threshold 
level of protection. The
 
higher participant numbers in the
 
1 mg/kg IV
 
a
nd 5 mg/kg SC groups
 
allow for more data at the lowest dose group to try to identify a protective antibody titer 
threshold and to support 
future
 
trials assessing the SC route in malarial

Addition of Intramuscular Injection
 
Cohort in v.2.0
 
With the version 2.0 amendment, a cohort is being added to receive a 5 mg/kg dose of L9LS by 
[CONTACT_52596]. The purpose of this amendment is to 
evaluate
 
the 
safety, tolerability and PK of 
L9LS by [CONTACT_52597]. 
 
Data on this route 
may
 
support develop
ment
 
of phase [ADDRESS_55778] intravenous access, 
to be able to receive L9LS
. 
Since
 
this arm is b
eing added 
after
 
the CHMI 
has occurred
, this group will not participate in the CHMI.

Background
 
1.2.1.
 
Previous Human Experience 
 
There 
i
s 
no human experience with 
L9LS 
prior to this trial
. 
Prior clinical experience in 
completed and ongoing Phase 1 and 2 trials
 
of healthy adults with human mAbs manufactured 
and formulated by [CONTACT_52598]

]
 
are used to summarize the general safety risk associated 
with mAbs. 
 
 
Treatments with these
 
mAbs have been generally well tolerated, with no reported deaths or 
serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed as related to the study products.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_52556], the 
predominant local reactogenicity complaint has been mild pain/tenderness, although reports o
f 
mild injection site pruritus, redness and swelling have occurred at modestly higher frequencies

.
 
Urticaria and infusion 
reactions comprised of chills, rig
ors, myalgia, headache, and/or fever have been reported after IV 
infusions at product doses of 10 to 40 mg/kg; these reactions have been transient, resolved 
without sequelae within 24 hours of onset, and treated with over

counter analgesics and 
antipyr
etics.
 
1.2.2.
 
Controlled Human Infections (CHI) 
 
Controlled human infection (CHI) trials (also referred to as Volunteer Infection Studies (VIS)) 
result in the experimental infection of healthy subjects with the infectious agent of choice and are 
an unparalleled t
ool in infectious disease research.  CHI trials allow for the 
accelerate
d 
evaluation
 
of novel drugs and
 
vaccines
 
for po
tential efficacy, while also providing the 
opportunity to prospectively study clinical disease progression.  The first controlled human 
malaria infection (CHMI) was performed in the mid
-
1980s 
[
12
]
.
  
This process involves the 
deliberate infection with malaria parasites either by [CONTACT_52599]
. 
 
VRC has 
successfully conducted
 
three 
Phase 1 CHMI studies
:
 
VRC 312 
[
13
]
,
 
VRC 314
 
[
14
]
, and
 
VRC 
612 
[
7
]
.
  
 
Accord
ing to a comprehensive review of CHI trials using a variety of pathogens, an estimated 
[ADDRESS_55780] received CHI 
[
15
]
.  Only four possibly
-
related SAEs have been reported, of 
which two were observed following malaria vaccination a
nd CHMI 
[
15
]
.  The first cardiac event 
of possible myocarditis, reported in 2008
 
[
16
]
, prompted recommendation by a panel of experts 
that consideration of cardiac risk be required for clinical challenge trials and that individuals 
identified as a
t increased cardiovascular risk be excluded from malaria clinical challenge trials
 
[
17
]
.  A second cardiac event was observed in 2013 following malaria vaccination and CHMI
 
[
18
]
. 
 
VRC was also informed of a possible 3
rd
, unpublished, myocarditis event in 2014. 
 
A
s a 
result of these events and the recommenda
tions, e
vidence of increas
ed cardiovascular disease 
risk or an e
lectrocardiogram (ECG) with clinically significant abnormalities
 
will preclude trial 
enrollment
 
as described in 
Section
 
4.1.2
. 
 
The challenge phase in this study will be performed
 
with Pf strain 3D7
 
[
sensitive to Chloroquine 
and Malarone (atovaquone and proguanil)
]
 
via mosquito bite, which is the natural route of 
exposure and transmission i
n the field.  While subjects will be
 
monitored closely
 
throughout 
study duration, monitoring intensity will increase
 
following 
exposure to Pf
-
infected mosquitoes 
to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment.  Appropriate drug therapy will be used to treat 
and cure 
any subject with a confirmed Pf
 
infection
 
after diagnosis by [CONTACT_954], the most sensitive assessment 
for detecting early malaria infection, in order to 
minimize
 
the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a serious

2.2.
 
Preclinical Experience
 
To assess 
L9LS 
as a candidate for clinical tri
als, research grade mAb was 
assessed for 
in vitro
 
functional activity
 
including 
binding properties
 
and 
auto
-
reactivity
, 
in vivo
 
protection following 
challenge
 
using a mouse
 
infection model
, and 
in vivo
 
PK 
using a
n
 
NHP
 
model
.  In mice, 
L9 
was 
more 
potent than CIS43, and both L9LS and L9 mediated the same potency following challenge
.  
In NHP PK studies, 
L9LS 
exhibited substantially longer half
-
life in blood as compared to 
the 
parental 
L9 mAb 
without the LS mutation.
 
Two preclinical toxicology studies
 
were conducted with a process
-
representative developmental 
batch of L9LS.  An 
in vitro
 
tissue cross
-
reactivity (TCR) assay to screen for potential cross
-
reactivity and an 
in vivo
 
rat toxicity study to demonstrate safety were 
both 
conducted in 
compliance w
ith Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 58 (21 CFR 58) Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies
.
 
2.2.1
 
Tissue Cross
-
Reactivity (TCR) Study
 
The TCR assay screened a standard panel of normal human tissues (
three
 
donors per tissue) and 
Sprague Dawley rat tissues (
two
 
rats per tissue).  Mammalian cells transfected to express CSP 
were used as a tissue positive control.  Two concentrations of L9LS were tested: 1.15 µg/ml 
(selected as the concentration which saturated
 
the positive control tissue), and 11.5 µg/ml (10
-
fold excess).  A negative control IgG1
κ
 
antibody 
(GR338422
-
1, no mammalian target antigen) 
was tested at the same two concentrations. 
 
L9LS exhibited scattered specific membrane binding 
in 3/3 human salivar
y gland tissue samples
, which
 
localized to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_52560].  Binding was rare (1
-
5% of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]) at 1.15 µg/ml, 
and 
rare to occasional 
(5
-
25% of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]) at 11.5 µg/ml.  The cause of the salivary
 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_52561]

gland tissue 
was not observed for the negative control antibody
. 
 
L9LS did not bind to rat salivary epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. 
 
No specific membrane
-
binding to other human t
issues was observed.
 
2.2.2
 
Rat Toxicity Study
 
Sprague Dawley rats were dosed with L9LS to evaluate toxicity and toxicokinetics.  Rats 
received 0, 40, or 400 mg/kg by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) bolus injection twice (Day 1 and Day 11).  
Female rats were dosed with 10
 
mg/kg by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection once
 
(D1)
; male rats were 
dosed with 10 mg/kg SC twice (D1 and D11); both male and female rats were dosed with 100 
mg/kg SC twice (Day 1 and Day 11).  For all dose
-
levels, the main
-
group was necropsied at Day 
[ADDRESS_55784]
-
dose (up to + 0.5
o
C, considered 
a 
non

L9LS
 
in
 
Healthy Adults
 
 
VRC 614, Version 2.[ADDRESS_55785] level 
(NOAEL) was the high
 
dose, 400 mg/kg IV x2. For SC dosing, the N
OAEL was the high
-
dose, 
100 mg/kg SC x2.  SC injection of L9LS did not cause reactogenicity (edema, erythema, eschar) 
in any rat.  Histopathology 
evaluation 
of the SC injection site skin 
reported
 
minimal to moderate 
subcutaneous mixed cell infiltration
,
 
co
nsidered treatment
-
related and predictive for human 
volunteers.  One treated rat (in the 100 mg/kg SC group) was found dead; this 
event 
was 
attributed to a procedural error the previous day and is not considered treatment
-
related.  One 
treated female (in t
he 100 mg/kg SC recovery group) had grossly
-
visible heart enlargement 
(2
-
fold increase in both heart weight and heart:body weight compared to the control means), with 
normal heart histology.  Spontaneous cardiomyopathies are occasionally observed for the 
S
prague Dawley strain
 
of rat
.  Based on the singular incidence, this observation is not considered 
treatment
-
related.
 
With reference to the CDER 2005 Guidance for Industry Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting 
Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics
 
in Adult Healthy Volunteers
1
, scaling based on 
body weight is appropriate for a mAb expected to distribute mainly in the vascular space.  The 
rat IV NOAEL of 400 mg/kg x2 supports the IV clinical high
-
dose with a 20
-
fold dose margin.  
The rat SC NOAEL of
 
100 mg/kg x2 supports the SC clinical dose with a 20
-
fold dose margin.

Parasitemia
 
Management
 
Following CHMI, a case of malaria parasitemia will be defined as
 
either a single 
positive 
PCR 
result 
or a thick blood smear 
that meet
s
 
the criteria for positivity. 
 
PCR 
allows for cases of 
malaria to be identified before gametocytes can develop
 
and thus before detection of 
gametocytes by [CONTACT_52616].  Malaria infection will be treated when the criterion 
for a case is met.
 
 
 
Regardless of PCR 
or
 
blood smear 
results, all
 
CHMI participants will receive 
directly observed 
anti
malaria
l
 
treatment
 
at Day 
[ADDRESS_55810]

Adverse Events
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally ass
ociated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  In the context of FDA
-
required 
reporting, an AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug
 
in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.

Serious Adverse Events
 
The term “Serious Adverse Event” (SAE) is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows:  “An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator 
or the sponsor, it results in any of the
 
following outcomes:  Death, a life
-
threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
con
genital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life
-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and ma
y require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio
ns that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.”

“Life threatening” refers to an AE or suspected adverse reaction that represents an immediate 
risk of death to the subject.  It does not include an AE
 
or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52566] a SAE.
 
5.3.
 
Adverse Event Reporting to the IND Sponsor
 
AEs that meet SAE criteria m
ust be reported and submitted by [CONTACT_52620], 
VRC/NIAID/NIH
, according to sponsor guidelines as
 
follows:
 
•
 
Results in death;
 
•
 
Is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
i
t
 
occurred);
 
•
 
Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
 
•
 
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
 
•
 
Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject; OR
 
•
 
Based 
upon app
ropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm
ent in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).
 
In addition, any event, regardless of severity, which in the judgment
 
of an investi
gator represents 
a SAE, may be reported on an expedited basis.
 
An investigator will communicate an initial SAE report within 24 hours of site awareness of 
occurrence to the IND Sponsor by [CONTACT_52621], which triggers an alert to the IND 
Spo
nsor MO.  Within 3 working days, a written summary by [CONTACT_52622].  
 
In order for the IND Sponsor to comply with regulations mandating sponsor notification of 
specified SAEs to the FDA within 7 and/or [ADDRESS_55817] submit 
additional information as soon as it is available.
 
5.4.
 
IND Sponsor Reporting to the FDA 
 
The IND Sponsor is responsible for making the determination of which SAEs are “serious and 
unexpected suspected adverse reactions” (SUS
ARs) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
•
 
Suspected 
A
dverse 
R
eaction
 
means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. 
 
•
 
Unexpected Adverse Event
 
means an AE that is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observ
ed. 
 
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs (as determined by [CONTACT_9533]) will be reported to the FDA as IND Safety 
Reports
 
per [ADDRESS_55818]
 
The following information is consistent with NIH IRB Policy 801: Reporting Research Events, 
Version 1, effective July 1, 2019. 
 
Reportable Event
:
 
 
An event that occurs during the course of human subject research that 
requires notification to the IRB.
 
For the purposes of this policy, reportable events include the following:
 
•
 
Unanticipated 
P
roblems 
(UPs) 
involving risks to subjects or others
 
•
 
Non
-
compli
ance (including major protocol deviations and noncompliance that is not 
related to a protocol deviation)
 
•
 
Deaths related or possibly related to research activities
 
•
 
New information that might affect the willingness of subjects to enroll or continue 
participa
tion in the study
 
5.5.1.
 
Unanticipated Problem
 
An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all
 
the following criteria:
 
•
 
Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol
-
related documents, such as the IRB approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the sub
ject 
population being studied; 
and
 
•
 
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_52623]); 
and
 
•
 
Suggests that the research places subjects, or others (which may include research staff, 
family members or other individuals not directly participating in the research) at a greater 
risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or so
cial harm) related to the 
research than was previously known or expected.
 
A UP must be reported within 7 calendar days of an investigator becoming aware of the actual or 
suspected UP.
 
5.5.2.
 
Non
-
Compliance 
 
Non
-
compliance is the failure 
of investigator(s) to foll
ow the applicable laws, regulations, or 
institutional policies governing the protection of human subjects in research, or the requirements 
or determinations of the IRB, whether intentional or not.

Non
-
compliance may be unintentional (e.g. due to lack of 
understanding, knowledge, or 
commitment), or intentional (e.g. due to deliberate choice to ignore or compromise the 
requirements of any applicable regulation, organizational policy, or determination of the IRB).
 
Non
-
compliance is further characterized as s
erious or continuing as follows:
 
•
 
Serious non
-
compliance
 
–
 
Non
-
compliance, whether intentional or not, that results in 
harm or otherwise materially compromises the rights, welfare and/or safety of the subject. 
Non
-
compliance that materially effects the scie
ntific integrity or validity of the research 
may be considered serious non
-
compliance, even if it does not result in direct harm to 
research subjects.
 
•
 
Continuing non
-
compliance
 
–
 
A pattern of recurring non
-
compliance that either has 
resulted, or, if contin
ued, may result in harm to subjects or otherwise materially 
compromise the rights, welfare and/or safety of subjects, affect the scientific integrity of 
the study or validity of the results.  The pattern may comprise repetition of the same non
-
compliant ac
tion(s), or different noncompliant events.  
 
Any actual or suspected non
-
compliance by [CONTACT_52624]/designee within [ADDRESS_55819] becoming aware.
 
5.5.3.
 
Protocol Deviation 
 
A Protocol Deviation (PD) is defined as any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB
-
approved research protocol and are further characterized as major and minor as follows: 
 
•
 
Major Deviation
s
 
–
 
Deviations from the IRB approved protocol that have, or may have the 
potential to, negatively impact, the rights, welfare or safety of the subject, or to 
substantially negatively impact the scientific integrity or validity of the study. 
 
•
 
Minor Deviatio
ns 
–
 
Deviations that do not have the potential to negatively impact the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or others, or the scientific integrity or validity of the 
study.  
 
For the reporting purposes, failure of subjects to comply with the research pr
otocol does not 
represent non
-
compliance unless that failure is due to an action or omission of a member of the 
research team, for example, the failure to give adequate instruction to the subject.
 
A major deviation must be reported within [ADDRESS_55820] the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or 
the study’s ability to produce scientifically valid 
results.  A series of minor deviations pointing 
toward a more global issue that could affect the rights, safety or welfare of the participant or

concentration data generated from each subject.  Individual subject and dosing group 
concentration vs time profiles will be constructed in linear an

log scales.  In the NC 
analysis the maximum concentration (Cmax) and time of maximal concentration (Tmax) will be 
taken directly from the observed data.  The area under the concentrations vs. time curve (AUC) 
will be calculated using the trapezoidal
 
method and determined out to the final concentration 
collected.  If a subjects L9LS concentration falls below the quantitative limit (QL) of the assay 
before the final of PK sample collection, the sample with concentration below the QL will be 
assigned a 
L9LS concentration value of “0” for AUC calculations.  Later PK samples after the

Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses
:  Population PK analyses will be performed on the PK 
data following IV and SC administration to determine compartmental PK parameters with the 
PK program NONMEM 7.3 or later (ICON
R
).  Based on preclinical PK results for 
L9LS and 
known PK behavior studies of mAbs, two

compartment model will be used (subroutine 
ADVAN4 TRANS4).  Both zero order and first order absorption following SC administration 
will be evaluated and a lag time included if a delay is seen in the raw data 
figures.  The First 
Order Conditional Estimation Method with Interaction (FOCEI) will be used.  The population 
analysis will generate estimates for clearance (CL) central and peripheral volumes of distribution 
(Vd

), inter

Risk/Benefit Assessment 
 
8.5.1.
 
Potential Risks
 
Risk of 
L9LS
:
 
The risk o
f L9LS is not yet known as this is the first in human study. 
 
A
 
similar 
malaria antibody,
 
CIS43LS
,
 
was
 
evaluated as safe and
 
well
-
tolerated
 
in the VRC 612 study
[

]
.
 
Investigational monoclonal antibody, L9LS, exhibited scattered membrane binding which 
localized to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_52573] a preclinical
 
tissue cross
-
reactivity study. Binding was rare at an antibody concentration of 1.15 µg/ml, and 
rare to occasional at 11.5 µg/ml. These findings are of unclear clinical significance. Any effect 
on the salivary glands from L9LS, if present, is expected to 
be transient due to clearance of the 
passively transferred antibody over time. Additionally, salivary gland epi[INVESTIGATOR_52574]. 
 
To address these findings, 
the trial will
 
e
xclude 
individuals
 
at an increased risk for salivary gland 
dysfunction and will prospectively monitor for signs and symptoms that may be indicative of 
salivary gland 
abnormality
.

Institute

assisted the study team in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a risk mitigation 
strategy and ha
ve
 
agreed to participate in eligibility or adverse even
t
 
ev
aluations as needed by 
[CONTACT_3476]
.
 
Evidence of clinically significant salivary gland toxicity will be considered at 
each dose escalation review and dose escalation would not proceed if clinical toxicity is 
identified. 
 
Risk
s
 
of
 
m
Ab
 
Administration
:  Adm
inistration of mAbs may cause immune reactions such as 
acute anaphylaxis, serum sickness and the generation of antibodies.  However, these reactions 
are rare and more often associated with mAbs targeted to human proteins or with the use of 
mouse mAbs that 
would have a risk of human anti
-
mouse antibodies 
[
25
]
.  In this regard, 
because 
L9LS
 
is targeted to a
 
malaria
 
parasite antigen and is a human mAb, it is expected to 
have a low risk of such side effects. 
 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the side effects of mAbs are mild to 
moderate and may include local reactions at the 
injection site (including pain, redness, bruising, swelling) and systemic reactions such as fever, 
chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, 
hypotension, 
hypertension, pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea, tachycardia or chest 
pain.  Clinical use of mAbs that are targeted to cytokines or antigens associated with human cells 
may be associated with an increased risk of infections 
[
25
]
; however, this is not expected to be a 
risk for a mAb targeted to a p
arasite antigen. 
 
Severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and hypoxia, are 
infrequent and more often associated with mAbs targeted to human proteins or with non
-
human 
mAb, such as a mouse mAb 
[
25
]
.  Most infusion
-
related events occur within the first [ADDRESS_55842] cell surface targets on lymphocytes 
shows that infusion of a mAb may be associated with cytokine release, causing a reaction known 
as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
[
26
]
.  CRS reactions commonly occur within the first few 
hours of infusion start and with the first mAb 
infusion received.  This is because the cytokine 
release is associated with lysis of the cells targeted by [CONTACT_52638] 
L9LS
 
in
 
Healthy Adults
 
 
VRC 614, Version 2.[ADDRESS_55843] mAb treatment.  With licensed therapeutic mAbs, CRS is 
managed by [CONTACT_52639][INVESTIGATOR_51119], administering histamine blockers and restarting 
the infusion at a slower rate 
[

]
.
 
 
Supportive treatment may also be indicated for some signs and 
symptoms.  
 
Delayed allergic reactions that include
 
a serum sickness type of reaction characterized by 
[CONTACT_22815], fever, lymph 
node enlargement, and joint pains, typi[INVESTIGATOR_52575] 
[
25
]
.  In general, and 
with due consideration of the needs dictated by [CONTACT_52640], immediate and delayed reactions to
 
study product would be managed 
according to the principles of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology 
guidelines established in the Drug Allergy: Practice Parameters (2010). 
 
Participation in this study may limit a subject’s eligibility fo
r future mAb studies. 
 
Risks of Blood Drawing
:  Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, and a feeling of 
lightheadedness or fainting. Rarely, it may cause infection at the site where blood is taken. In this 
study, an IV line that can be used for blood 
collection may be placed in the arm and left in place 
for several hours on days when there is product administration for frequent PK blood draws.  
Problems from use of an IV for blood drawing are generally mild and may include pain, bruising, 
minor swellin
g or bleeding at the IV site and rarely, infection, vein irritation (phlebitis), or blood 
clot.
 
Risks of Mosquito Bite
s for CHMI
:  Risks
 
associated 
with CHMI
 
include local inflammatory 
reactions, lymphadenitis, persistent 
local 
pruritus and larger local re
actions involving the whole 
forearm, allergic reactions to mosquito bites
.  
Another remotely possible risk includes a systemic 
allergic reaction to the mosquit
oes
.
 
Risks of 
Acquiring 
Malaria
 
Infection
:  
There is also the possibility of complications of 
mal
aria, which are seen during naturally acquired malaria when diagnosis and treatment are 
delayed and high levels of parasitemia develop
.  
Under the carefully controlled conditions of this 
study
 
that supports early diagnosis and treatment
, the chance of such
 
complications is unlikely 
and the risk of death from malaria infection is very small. 
 
Transient abnormalities, e.g. fever, 
headache, myalgia, shaking chills, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, mild anemia, 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
hepato
splenom
egaly, hepatic tenderness and fatigue, are expected 
consequences of malaria
.  
In uncontrolled circumstances, malaria infections can lead to kidney, 
liver or brain injury (seizures, coma) and death. 
 
Risks of Anti
m
alarial Medication
:  
Additional risks inclu
de possible side effects of the 
antimalarial medication taken (chloroquine) following challenge with chloroquine
-
sensitive
 
Pf. 
These side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, headaches, 
sleep disturbances, blurred vision, 
pruritus, skin rash, exacerbation of psoriasis or porphyria, 
tinnitus, and photosensitivity
.  
Rarely, there may be changes in electrocardiogra
ms and 
hypotension.  S
ide effects 
of atovaquone/p
roguanil (Malarone
®
) include nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, an
orexia, diarrhea, headache, cough and rarely, anemia, oral ulcerations, 
insomnia, fever, edema, rash and alopecia.
 
 
Another remotely possible risk includes a systemic 
allergic reaction to chloroquine (or Malarone
®
)
.  
The study team will discuss these medic
ations 
and their possible side effects in detail both as part of the informed consent process
, prior to 
CHMI,
 
and prior to initiation of treatment for 
diagnosed
 
malaria
 
infection

studies conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.
 
8.5.2.
 
Potential Benefits
 
Study subjects will not receive direct health benefit from study participation.  Others ma
y benefit 
from knowledge gained in this study that may aid in the development of malaria prevention.
 
8.5.3.
 
Assessment of Potential Risk
s
 
and Benefits
 
This research study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP guidance, and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
The plan for reduction of
 
known and unknown
 
risks 
to participants 
includes appropriate training 
of study
 
personnel; education of study subjects for participation in care throughout the study; 
monitoring of study subject’s health status and experiences; withdrawal from study procedures 
upon evidence of difficulty, contraindication, or a significant adverse ev
ent; and referral for 
treatment, counseling or other necessary follow
-
up. 
 
The VRC CTP Risk Management Plan 
guides the reduction and mitigation strategies applied to the known and unknown risks 
associated with study participation
 
and trial management/opera
tions. 
 
As study subjects will not receive direct health benefit from study participation or product 
administration, no alternative procedures are planned. T
he alternative 
course of action 
is
 
to 
choose
 
not to participate.
 
8.6.
 
Plan for Use and Storage of Biolog
ical Samples
 
The plan for use and storage of biological samples from this protocol is outlined in the following 
sections.
 
8.6.1.
 
Use of Samples, Specimens and Data
 
Samples
, specimens
 
and data collected under this protocol may be used to 
conduct protocol
-
related s
afety, parasitology and immunogenicity evaluations, 
exploratory laboratory evaluations 
related to malaria, exploratory laboratory evaluations related to mAb, vaccine or infectious 
disease research in general and for research assay validation.  
 
Stored samp
les may also be used later for exploratory genetic factors that may influence the 
immune response. No specific results will be provided to participants or their health care 
providers because we will not be investigating genetic analyses that have known med
ical 
diagnoses (e.g. Huntington’s disease) or other medically actionable genetic information.
 
8.6.2.
 
Storage and Tracking of Blood Samples and Other Specimens 
 
All research samples use coded labels that only the VRC 
VEC
 
can link to the subject. Samples 
are stored
 
at VIP or VRC laboratories in Building 40, Bethesda, MD, which are both secure 
facilities with limited access.  Data will be kept in password
-
protected computers.  Only 
investigators or their designees will have access to the samples and data.  Samples wi
ll be 
tracked in the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database or using another 
software designed for this purpose (e.g., Freezerworks).

I
n the future, other investiga
tors (both at NIH and outside) may wish to study these samp
les 
and/or data.  
IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples
 
with non
-
NIH 
investigators and a
ny clini
cal information shared about those samples
 
would similarly require 
prior IRB ap
proval
.  
The research use of stored, unlinked or unidentified samples 
will
 
be exempt 
from the need for prospective IRB review and approval. 
 
Exemption requests will be submitted 
in writing to the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research, which is authorized to determine 
whether a research activity is exempt. 
 
At the time of protocol termination, samples will remain in the 
VIP 
facility or VRC labor
atories 
or, after IRB approval, will be transferred to another repository.  Regulatory oversight of the 
stored samples and data may be transferred to a stored samples protocol as part of the IRB 
approved termination plan.  Data will be archived by [CONTACT_52641], or after IRB and study sponsor approval, it may be either 
destroyed or transferred to another repository.
 
8.6.4.
 
Loss or D
estruction of S
amples, Specimens
 
or Data
  
 
Any loss or unanticipated destr
uction of samples (for example, due to freezer malfunction) or 
data (for example, misplacing a printout of data with identifiers) will be reported to the IRB.
  
The Protocol Chair or PI [INVESTIGATOR_52576].
 
Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on 
the participant’s employment or work situation.
  
The NIH information sheet regarding NIH 
employee research participation will be distributed 
to all potential subjects who are NIH 
employees.
  
The employee subject’s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance 
with 
applicable
 
policies
 
at the study site
.
 
 
For any
 
employee subjects, consent will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_52642]’s team. 
 
At NIH, if the individual obtaining 
consent is a co
-
worker to the subject, independent monitoring of the consent process will be 
included through the Bioethics Consultation Service.  P
rotocol study staff will be trained o
n 
obtaining potentially sensitive and private information from co
-
workers or subordinates. 
 
8.7.
 
Safety Oversight
 
Close cooperation between the designated members of the Protocol Team will occur to evaluate 
and respond to individual AEs in a timely manner.  The
 
VRC 
clinic 
designated Safety Officer 
(SO) for the day conducts a daily safety review of clinical data per VRC Standard Operating 
Procedures. 
A 
Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) comprised of the Principal Investigator 
(PI), Associate Investigators, Study 
Coordinator, Protocol Specialists, other study clinicians, and 
the IND MO, will review the summary study safety data reports per the protocol
-
defined 
frequency. In addition, an Independent 
Safety Monitor (ISM),
 
who is not associated with the 
VRC will provi
de safety oversight.
 
The designated 
ISM
 
will receive safety report
s
 
that contains a line listing of all adverse events 
that occurred to date. The 
ISM
 
will meet with the PSRT during the weekly protocol safety 
meeting to clarify, discuss, and provide an impression of the safety data acquired to date. 
Meetings
 
and safety report distribution
 
will transition to a monthly schedule beginning [ADDRESS_55844] occurred,

term medical care or financial compensation 
for research
-
related injuries will be provided by [CONTACT_18121], the NIH Clinical Center, or the Federal 
Government. However, 
subjects
 
have the righ

If subjects are injured because of participation in this research during the CHMI and they are a 
DOD healthcare beneficiary (e.g., active duty in the military, militar
y spouse or dependent, 
retiree), they are entitled to medical care for their injury within the DOD healthcare system, as 
long as they remain a DOD healthcare beneficiary. 
 
If subjects are injured because of participation in this research during the CHMI an
d they are not 
a DOD healthcare beneficiary, they are entitled to medical care for their injury at a DOD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52581], but such care for the injury at DOD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52582]

Healthy Adults
 
 
VRC 614, Version 2.[ADDRESS_55889] or CHMI will be assessed by [CONTACT_52652].
 
•
 
Definitely Related
:
 
 
The AE and administration of study product and/or CHMI are 
related in time, and a direct association can be demonstrated.
 
•
 
Probably Related
:
 
 
The AE and administration of study produ
ct and/or CHMI are 
reasonably related in time, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_52653].
 
•
 
Possibly Related
:
 
 
The AE and administration of study product and/or CHMI are 
reasonably related in time, but the AE can be explain
ed equally well by [CONTACT_52654].
 
•
 
Not Related
:
 
 
The AE is clearly explained by [CONTACT_52655].
 
For purposes of preparing summary data reports in which AE attributions are simplified to 
“Relate
d” or “Not Related”, in this protocol, the “Definitely, Probably and Possibly” attributions 
above will be mapped to the “Related” category, while the “Unlikely/Probably Not Related” and 
“Not Related” attributions above will be mapped to the “Not Related” c
ategory.  The definitions 
that apply when these two attribution categories alone are used are as follows:
 
•
 
Related
:
 
 
There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study 
product or CHMI.
 
•
 
Not Related
:
  
There is not a reasonable possibili

Grading the Severity of an Adverse Event
 
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events, Corrected Version 2.1 [July 2017] will be used to determin
e the severity grades of AEs

Several modifications were made to the table as follows:
 
•
 
Weight loss will be recorded as an AE only if it is considered deleterious to the 
participant’s health.
 
•
 
For severity grading of the solicited bruising parameter at the product 
administration site, 
the definitions based on size of the largest diameter and listed for the “Injection Site 
Erythema or Redness” will be used.  The severity grade definition for “Bruising” 
provided under the Dermatologic Clinical Conditions will be used 
only for unsolicited 
AEs involving bruising at other body locations.
 
•
 
Creatinine changes will be graded on the basis of the upper limit of normal provided by 
[CONTACT_52656].
 
•
 
Creatinine clearance changes will be graded accordi
ng to ml/min provided by [CONTACT_52657].
 
•
 
Subclinical CMP results for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, and glucose 
will not be considered an AE unless Grade 2 or higher.

in
 
Healthy Adults
 
 
VRC 614, Version 2.[ADDRESS_55890] will complete the sequence of steps outlined below.
 
 
 
1.
 
Obtain a pre
-
filled, DEHP
-
free
,
 
100 mL IV bag of 0.9% saline.
 
 
 
2.
 
Remove the air from the IV bag.
 
 
3.
 
Calculate the
 
total dose needed to prepare L9LS in the 0.9% saline bag in order to achieve 
the ideal concentration of
 
 
≥ 2 mg/mL.
 
 
 
The IV bag may be prepared with a higher volume than required (i.e. overfill) to ensure 
proper administration via volumetric
 
pump.
 
 
 
Maintaining
 
infusible volume of
 
L9LS at the minimum concentration of 2 mg/mL may cause 
the total L9LS dose in the bag to exceed the lower weight
-
based dose (e.g., 1 mg/kg).
 
 
Do not infuse the entire volume of the IV bag if the total amount 
exceeds the weight
-
based 
dose of the subject.
 
 
4.
 
Thaw and equilibrate vials on the bench at room temperature for 90 minutes. If vials are 
stored at 5°C ± 3°C, equilibrate for approximately 30 min at room temperature before use.
 
 
5.
 
Gently swirl the vials for 30
 
seconds to mix while avoiding foaming. Vials should never be 
shaken.
 
 
 
6.
 
Withdraw the necessary amount of L9LS and add it to the IV bag so that final concentration 
in bag is 
≥
 
2 mg/
mL.
 
 
 
7.
 
Add the syringe contents to the sterile bag of saline using good st
erile compounding 
technique.
 
 
 
8. 
 
An in
-
line filter infusion set is required for IV product administrations and must comply with 
the following specifications: 1.2 micron
 
polyethersulfone
 
filter membrane, DEHP
-
free, latex
-
free (equivalent to B. Braun #4739
94 filter extension set). After the in
-
line filter is added to 
the tubing, the administration set must be primed.
 
 
 
Note: If the compounded IV preparation has been stored at 5°C ± 3°C, equilibrate for 
approximately [ADDRESS_55891] 
tolerance.
 
 
The mL/
hr
 
infusion rate m
ay vary based on the total volume needed to administer a 
full dose.
 
 
 
IV bag prepared without overfill:
 
 
 
At the end of product administration, the IV administration set 
must
 
be flushed with about 30 
mL (or appropriate volume) of normal saline.
 
 
IV bag p
repared
 
with overfill:
 
 
At the end of product administration, the IV administration set should 
not
 
be flushed with saline. 
 
 
 
 
L9LS
 
in
 
Healthy Adults
 
 
VRC 614, Version 2.[ADDRESS_55892] will complete the sequence of steps 
as outlined in this section.
 
 
1.
 
Calculate the total mg DP needed.
 
2.
 
Thaw and equilibrate vials on the bench at room temperature for 90 minutes. If v
ials are 
stored at 5°C ± 3°C, equilibrate for approximately 30 min at room temperature before use.
 
 
3.
 
Gently swirl the vials for 30 seconds to mix while avoiding foaming. Vials should never be 
shaken.
 
 
 
4.
 
Withdraw the necessary amount of L9LS using a 5
-
micron 
filter needle
 
(maximum syringe 
fill volume of 2.5
 
ml for SC and 1.0
 
mL for IM)
.
 
Use a new filter needle for each syringe.
 
5.
 
Prior to dispensing, discard the filter needle and replace it with a needle suitable for SC 
or IM 
injection.
 
 
Note: 
 
If SC 
or IM 
preparations have been stored at 5°C ± 3°C, equilibrate for approximately 30 
min at room temperature before use.

important to you in making your decision. Additional information that may help you decide can 
be found in other sections of the document.
This is a study of an experimental drug called “L9LS”. L9LS is a monoclonal antibody    that 
targets malaria. 
L9LS has not been tested in humans before this study
. We do not know  if 
L9LS will protect you from malaria infection. There is no malaria in L9LS, so you cannot get 

you from malaria if you travel to a place where there is a risk of infection.
The main purpose of this study is to see if L9LS is safe and how your body responds to the 
antibody. This is the first time that L9LS will be given to people, and we do not know how your 

If you have side effects from L9LS, we expect them to be like those that occur with other 
antibody products. These side effects include fever, chills, shaking, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, 
pain, headache, dizziness, and tiredness. They usually occur within the first 24 hours after the 

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
Malaria is a disease that affects more than 250 million people throughout the world.  The parasites 
that cause malaria are known as 
Plasmodium
.  They live in the mosquito saliva and are injected 
into the skin when a mosquito bites a human.  This can cause malaria infection.  Malaria occurs in 
most tropi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] parts of the world including Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.  It is a serious 
threat to the local populations, to travelers and to military personnel stationed overseas.  Although 
there are medicines to treat malaria, there is no vaccine that fully prevents infection and treatment 
is not easy to get in many areas of the world.  If malaria is not treated right away, it can become a 
serious and sometimes deadly disease.  If it is treated right away, it can be completely cured.
The purpose of this research study is to test a drug that could prevent malaria infection in humans 
called L9LS.  L9LS is considered investigational, which means that it has not been approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent malaria infection.  It is a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) that targets the parasites that cause malaria.  Antibodies are naturally made by the 
immune  system  to  fight  infection  by  blocking  germs  (bacteria  and  parasites)  like  malaria.  
Monoclonal means that all the antibodies in L9LS are exactly the same.
L9LS was developed at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at NIH.  It was made in a laboratory 
and looks like an antibody that your own body could make.  It has shown promise for prevention 
of malaria in laboratory and animal studies, but it has not yet been studied in humans.
This is the first study to give L9LS to humans.
  We do not know if L9LS will protect you from 
malaria infection. You cannot get malaria from L9LS because there is no malaria in it. You should 
not assume L9LS will protect you from malaria.
The purpose of this research study is to see if L9LS is safe and how your body responds to it.  We 
will give you a dose of L9LS and measure how much of it stays in your body over time.  We also 
want  to  see  the  differences  between  getting  L9LS  as  an  infusion  in  a  vein  in  your  arm 
(intravenously, IV) as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously, SC) or as an injection into a 
muscle (intramuscularly, IM).
In this study, you will be exposed to malaria through bites from mosquitos infected with malaria 
parasites, if you are in Groups 1-5.  This is called a “malaria challenge” or a “Controlled Human 

you are bitten by the infected mosquitoes in a controlled setting.  We will monitor you closely and 
test your blood every day for many days to see if you get infected with malaria.  Even if your test 
is negative, we will give everyone malaria treatment by 21 days after CHMI.
We are asking you to join this research study because you are a healthy adult between the ages of 
18 and 50 who has never been infected with malaria.  If you are in Groups 1-5, you must be willing 
to take part in the CHMI and comply with follow-up requirements after CHMI to be in this study.  
If you take part in the CHMI, you must also agree not to travel to a malaria endemic region during 
the whole study and not to donate blood to a blood bank for 3 years after CHMI.  
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?
This study has 6 groups as shown in the Study Schema table below. Groups 1, 2,  3, 4, and 6 will 

CONTROLLED HUMAN MALARIA CHALLENGE (CHMI) – GROUPS 1-5 ONLY
To learn if L9LS can prevent malaria infection, we will conduct a CHMI. The CHMI will be 
performed by U.S. Military scientists, physicians and other trained personnel who are experienced 
in conducting a CHMI under controlled conditions.  It will take place at the Walter  Reed Army 
Institute of Research (WRAIR) facility in Silver Spring, Maryland. The CHMI visit will last about 
4 to 6 hours and begins very early in the morning. 
During the CHMI, we will put mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasites into a cup. The cup is 
covered with nylon tulle netting and allows the mosquitoes to bite you under controlled conditions. 
They cannot escape from the cup.  No more than 5 mosquitoes are put in the cup at one time. You 
will hold the cup against your arm for 5 minutes and then the mosquitos will be checked for blood 
feeding and presence of malaria parasites. If needed, more mosquitoes may be added until we are 
sure that a total of 5 mosquitoes have fed on your blood.
Follow up after the CHMI is very important so we can check your health. We know that it takes 
anywhere from 7-15 days to find malaria parasites in the blood.  So, after the CHMI, we will call 
you by phone to check on you 2 times in the first week. Then, starting on day 7, you must come to 
the NIH Clinical Center every day for about 30-minute visits through day 17 so we can collect 
blood for diagnostic and research purposes. The visits may be longer if medical evaluation is 
needed.  If  you  test  positive  for  malaria,  you  will  be  treated  right  away  with  anti-malarial 
medication.  We will also bring you back about 8 weeks after the CHMI to make sure you are 
cured.  At  day  21,  anyone  who still  has  a  negative  malaria  test  will  be  given  antimalarial 
medication.  This way we can make sure that anyone who might have malaria infection is treated, 
even if your tests are negative.  If you are negative for malaria, we will call you by phone to check 
on you about 8 weeks after the CHMI
This type of CHMI has been done for over 35 years for many malaria studies.  The mosquitoes 
that will be used are raised in a laboratory for CHMIs.  They are infected with a specific strain of 
the malaria parasite (
Plasmodium falciparum
) that is known to be treatable with the anti-malaria 
medication we will give you.  While the mosquitos are being grown, they feed on transfusion- 
quality human donor blood that has been screened following FDA requirements to make sure that 
the blood is not carrying any other infectious diseases. This type of malaria does not cause 
recurrent infections after you are treated.
HOW LONG WILL THE STUDY TAKE?
The study will last for about  24 weeks if you are in Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 that get L9LS. You will 

WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF BEING IN THE STUDY?
POSSIBLE RISKS OF L9LS
This study is the first time that L9LS will be given to people.  The information described below  is 
taken from studies with other antibodies that are like L9LS and may work the same.  Some of those 
antibodies are approved for use in people.  Like other drugs, monoclonal antibodies can cause side 
effects, some of which can be serious.  Most side effects occur within the first 24 hours   after an 
antibody is given.
·
Side effects to antibodies given by IV may include: fever, chills, shaking, nausea, 
vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness.  More serious but rare side effects may occur, 
including trouble   breathing, high or low blood pressure, itchiness, rash, hives, lip or 
face swelling, diarrhea, racing heart, or chest pain. These symptoms usually go away 
within a few minutes to hours after the product is given. We are giving L9LS at a 
controlled rate. If you develop symptoms while getting L9LS, tell the nurse right away. 
Slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] the flow  rate may help improve the symptoms.
·
Side effects to antibodies given by SC may include: mild itchiness, redness and/or 
swelling        at the site of injection. Tiredness, muscle pain, and headache have also been 
reported. These symptoms usually go away within 1 to 2 days.
·
Side effects to antibodies given IM include: mild itchiness, redness and/or swelling        at 
the site of injection. Tiredness, muscle pain, and headache have also been reported. 
These symptoms usually go away within 1 to 2 days.
Some antibodies have a risk of serious allergic reactions that can be life threatening including:
·
Anaphylaxis is one type of allergic reaction that may happen soon after an antibody is 
given. This reaction can include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives, rash, 
or swelling in the mouth and face.  This reaction is rare but can be life threatening. 
Participants will remain under observation in the time frame that this usually occurs. 
·
Serum sickness is a type of allergic reaction that may happen several days to weeks 
after an antibody is given. This reaction may include hives, rash, fever, enlarged lymph 
nodes, muscle pains, joint pains, chest discomfort or shortness of breath.
Some antibody products can increase the risk of serious infections.  L9LS is not expected to 
increase the risk of serious infections because it attacks a parasite and does not target the human 

POSSIBLE RISKS OF BLOOD DRAWING
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, and may cause a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting. 
Rarely, it may cause infection at the site where the blood is taken.  An IV line will be placed in 

POSSIBLE RISKS OF CHMI – GROUPS 1-5 ONLY 
During the CHMI, you will be bitten by mosquitoes that carry live malaria parasites which cause 
malaria infection.  We do not know if L9LS will protect people from malaria.  If you did not 

you may experience the        following symptoms:
·
Fever, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches, sweats, fatigue, insomnia
·
Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea
·
Decrease in numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
·
Enlarged liver or spleen
Symptoms are usually mild to moderate, but you may have some severe symptoms.  You may have 
fevers for 1 to 3 days.  You may miss time from work or school due to your illness.  You will not 
be compensated for any loss of income for missing work.   If malaria is not treated right away, it 
can lead to kidney, liver, heart or brain damage and death.  The CHMI is considered to be safe 
because people are closely monitored and treated as soon as they are found to have malaria 
infection, but they must remain in close contact with the study team.
After the CHMI, it is important that you come to the clinic for your scheduled visits so that 
the level of malaria parasites in your blood does not increase to dangerous levels

  For this reason, you 
must give the names and phone numbers of at least two emergency contacts to the study staff. We 
will contact them before the CHMI to confirm communication with them in case we are not able 
to reach you by phone, text, or email after CHMI.
Among the 2,700+ participants who have participated in a CHMI since 1971, two serious events 
have been reported.  Both were cardiac events (chest pain) and occurred in people who got an 
investigational malaria vaccine.  The pain was thought to be due to myocarditis (inflammation of 
the heart muscle).  Myocarditis is a reported complication from vaccinations.  Rarely, myocarditis 
has also been reported in association with naturally-acquired malaria infection.
These are the only two cases we know about in which a cardiac event occurred after CHMI.  In 
the  unlikely  event that you develop myocarditis,  you will  be evaluated  and followed by  a 
cardiologist until resolution.
If you feel unwell at any time after the CHMI, you may be asked to remain in the clinic until you 
are checked by a study doctor.  You might stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] overnight if needed.
POSSIBLE RISKS FROM TREATMENT FOR MALARIA – GROUPS 1-5 ONLY
Everyone who takes part in the CHMI will get antimalarial treatment by Day 21 after CHMI. 
Standard treatment for malaria takes 72 hours to complete. We will give you the medication at the  
first sign of infection in your blood.  You should expect to have malaria symptoms for about 3 
days.  Only drugs approved by the U.S. FDA will be used for treatment of malaria. We will treat 
you with Malarone unless you have a known allergy.  In that case, we would treat you with 
chloroquine or another suitable alternative.  Any drugs given are effective in treating the type of 
malaria parasite used for the CHMI.
The drugs that treat malaria may also cause some side effects. Treatments and their side effects 
are described below:
1. The first line of treatment will be Malarone. If you get Malarone, you may have the 

Local, allergic reactions are common after mosquito bites.  You may have itching and raised, red 
swelling at the sites of the bites.  These reactions usually develop quickly, go away 1 to 4 days 
after a mosquito bite, and do not need treatment.  So far, no severe allergic reactions to mosquito 
bites have been reported in prior CHMI studies. You will be observed for 30 minutes after the last 

POSSIBLE RISKS FROM STORED SAMPLES
There is a small chance that information from your medical records could be given to someone 
who should not get it without your permission.  It is possible for someone to use that information 
to discriminate against you when you apply for insurance or employment.  Similar problems may 
occur if you give information about yourself or agree to have your medical records released.
POSSIBLE RISKS OF DATA SHARING 
Information in the shared databases could be linked back to you and used to discriminate against 
you or  your  family.    State  and  federal laws  provide  some  protections  against  genetic  and 

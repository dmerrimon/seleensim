 Hypothesis and/or Specific Aims  or Objectives  
The primary aim  of this study is to explore the effects of self -affirmation via writing on 
patients newly diagnosed with advanced cancer, calculate effect sizes of the outcome 
variables, and estimate the appropriate sample size for the main study . 
 
The secondary aim  is to test the validity of the functional assessment of chronic illness 
therapy - spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being 12 item scale (FACIT -Sp-12), in its current  (Appendix  A) 
and revised forms  (Appendix  B). 
 
It is hypothesized that: self -affirmation at the time following a diagnosis of an advanced 
cancer by [CONTACT_742474]-esteem, reinforce spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being, decrease levels of anxiety or depression, and 
improve quality of life ( QoL). 
 
Study Design and Procedures   
A single group time series study design will be employed  (Figure 1) . 
 
         
 
       Figure 1: Timeline for the four data collection points  
 
The intervention  Participants will be asked to write as guided by [CONTACT_742475] 2 (two weeks post -baseline) for 4 weeks.  
 
Specific criteria  on the writing task:  
1) write with a focus on affirming one’s fundamental values and beliefs,  
2) write in connection with one’s cancer diagnosis, and  
3) write at least once for a minimum of 20 minutes per week for four weeks .  
 
To ensure that participants understand the nature and essence of the intervention, each 
patient will receive a page of writing instructions and a brief educational/informational 
session with the principal investigator (PI), both of which occur at two weeks post -baseline 
(Time 2 or T2); the writing instructions clarify the key expectations for the participants with 
respect to the writing intervention (in line with the criteria above) followed by [CONTACT_742476] -affirmation writing is and is not for this intervention .

 Both an online portal and notebooks for drafting and submitting the writings  will be created 
for participants; patients may choose either approach to perform the writing task. At the 
end of the study period (or any other point), participants have the option to share their 
writings with the PI. However, given the high privacy nature of the content, sharing 
writings with the researchers is not required (which will be clarified with t he participants) 
in order to encourage writing without reservation.  
 
Study Population  
The targeted participants are adult patients (age 18 or older) newly diagnosed with 
advanced cancer, and the total number of subjects to be enrolled  will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1014910] differences 
between paired observations in one sample, with α 0.05 and power 0.8 0 (Cohen, 1988) . 
 
The sample size  estimate  is tentative given the exploratory nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_742452]  (Bai, 2021) .

Measures  
Self-esteem  
The Rosenberg Self -Esteem Scale (RSE S) is an extensively used scale measuring self -
esteem with demonstrated validity and exc ellent reliability  (Rosenberg, 1965; Rosenberg, 
1979) . Empi[INVESTIGATOR_742461] (Joseph  et al. , 2019; Mohd -Sidik  et al., 2018) . RSES is rated on a 4 -
point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Scores range from 3 to 0, with higher 
score indicating higher level of self -esteem. For this study self -esteem will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_742477] 10 -item RSE S (Appendix  C).  
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734318] -being  
The 12 -item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734318] -Being scale 
(FACIT -Sp-12) (version 4) (Peterma n et al. , 2002)  is one of the most widely used spi[INVESTIGATOR_742462]-being scales. The scale is made up of 12 items scored on a 5 -point scale evaluating 
levels of spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being during the previous week as indicated by [CONTACT_742478], meaningfulness in lif e as well as strength and comfort derived from faith 
(Fitchett  et al. , 1996)  (Appendix  A).  
 
An overall score of spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being can be calculated by [CONTACT_742479] 12 items 
in the three factors of Peace, Meaning and Faith, ranging from 0 to 48, with higher scores 
indicating higher level of overall spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being. Prior studies suppo rted high internal 
reliabilities of the scale (e.g., Bai & Dixon, 2014; Peterman et al., 2002) , however with 
questionable construct validity on the Faith factor (Bai et al., 2016) .  
 
In the revised version of this scale, the term “spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]” will be replaced with “fundamental 
values and beliefs”, thereby [CONTACT_742480]:   Self-affirmation intervention for people newly diagnosed with advanced cancer:  A preliminary 
efficacy trial  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_742450]  
 
[ADDRESS_1014912] “spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]”. Pease refer to the enclosed measures for details of the revision  
(Appendix  B). 
 
Anxiety and Depression  
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) is a self -assessment scale that has 
been developed and found to be a reliable and valid instrument for detecting states of 
depression and anxiety in the setting of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_742463] l as 
measuring severity of the emotional disorder (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) . A two -factor 
dimensional structure of the HADS was generally supported in the literature  (Bjelland  et 
al., 2002) . The recommended thresholds for screening depression are 15 for the  HADS 
total, 7 for the HADS depression subscale  (Vodermaier & Millman, 2011)  (Appendix  D).  
 
Quality of Life  
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT -G) (version 4) (Cella et 
al., 1993)  was selected as measure of Q oL in this study. FACT -G contains 27 items that 
are scored on a 5 -point Likert scale (0 -4), evaluating Q oL of the previous week with high 
scores denoting better results. An overall Q oL score can be calculated by [CONTACT_742481] 27 items in the 4 sub -scales of physical well -being (7 items), social/family well -being 
(7 items), emotional well -being (6 items), and functional well -being (7 items). Reliability, 
validity as well as equivale nce by [CONTACT_742482] (intervie w vs. self -
administration) has been supported for this scale  (Cella et al., 1993; Webster  et al.,  2003) .  
 
An evaluation of Q oL using a total score is different from a global rating of Q oL (Ferrans, 
2007) . For the purpose of  this study, both the total and global Q oL will be assessed. The 
score of the single item of GF -[ADDRESS_1014913] -G will be used to 
evaluate the global assessment of Q oL, which explicitly asks the patient to rate the extent 
of contentment to current Q oL. In prior studies, GF -7 demonstrated a significant 
relationship with overall Q oL pi[INVESTIGATOR_742464]  (Brady  et al. , 1999; 
Whitford  et al. , 2008)  (Appendix  E).  
 
Checklist of Intervention Implementation  
Due to the  exploratory  nature of the trial, patients’ feedback to the intervention as well as 
the variables to be controlled (as evidence of intervention fidelity) will be collected in the 
checklist of the implementation of the intervention.  The checklist (Appendix  F) contains 
questions about the extent to which they felt the writing had helped them affirm their 
important values and beliefs, as well as the start timing, duration, focus/topic as well as 
duration of the writing.  
 
In addition  to the demographic information ( Appendix  G), as well as other health 
information  (including  medical conditions and cancer treatments)  to be collected from the 
medical records, patients will be asked to rate the perceived threat (Parle  et a., 1996)  at 
the baseline  whether and to what extent (on a 4 -point scale) they viewed the cancer

efficacy trial  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_742450]  
 
6 
 diagnosis as a threat. During each data collection meeting, participants will be asked to 
make global ratings of changes (GRC) (Jaeschke  et al. , 1989)  in QoL and spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -
being on the five -point response categories (Cella  et al.,  2002)  at the scale and factor 
levels .  
 
Finally, it has been suggested that measuring the patients’ assessment of the importance 
of different life quality domains over time is one way to gather possible changes in attitude 
and values, and aid interpretation of the outcome changes (Rustøen  et al., 2000) . The 
importance ratings for each subscale of the FACT -G and the FACIT -Sp-12 will be 
collected at each data -collection meeting.

**including the start time, duration, frequency and the focus/topic of the writing as well as the perceived helpfulness  
 
Additionally, an exit survey  (Appendix H ) will be used to capture t he number of eligible patients who decline or refuse participation , 
lost to follow -up at any point of study,  as well as  reasons of the lost to follow -up and/or withdrawal.  
 
Note : data collections will occur at the above scheduled windows +/ - 3 days.  
 
Risks and Benefits  
Although the aim of the writing assignment has been strictly focused on value/belief 
affirmation rather than emotion ventilation, it is possible that some subjects might still 
experience slight psychological distress during writing; every effort will be ma de to 
support subjects throughout their involvement in the study. In addition, subjects might find 
it burdensome to complete study outcome measures; the meeting s with the researcher  
will be scheduled at the time and place convenient to the subjects and the y will be given 
as much time as needed to complete measures comfortably. Subjects may also stop at 
any time and reschedule the data collection  if they would like. It will be explained to 
subjects that they may withdraw from the study at any time without repercussions. 
Subjects identified with depression as evidenced by a total score of 15 or higher on the 
HADS, or a score of 7 or higher on the H ADS depression subscale (Vodermaier & 
Millman, 2011)  will be informed of their scores and encouraged to tell their  physician how 
they are feeling. If they do not wish to inform their physician, they will be encouraged to 
use the psychosocial support resources  available and/or accessible .

 Data Analysis  
Specific Aim 1 . 
 
a. Intervention fidelity and feedback from the participants  
 
Fidelity of treatment in outcome research requires assessment and confirmation of the 
implementation of the independent variable as well as careful definition and 
operationalization of the intervention  (Moncher & Prinz, 1991) . For the purpose of this 
study, evidence of treatment fidelity will be assessed in the following aspects: 1) 
whether writing occurred at least once and (if so,) lasted for a minimum of 20 minutes 
each week, 2) whether writing was connected with the cancer diagnosis, and finally 3) 
whether writing focused on affirming one’s fu ndamental values and beliefs.  
 
Due to the  exploratory nature of the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], both the variables to be explored (that is, 
allowed to vary and without definitions) and the intervention parameters to be controlled 
(as specified above) will be collected in a checklist of the implementation of the 
intervention  (Appendix  F). Specifically, the participants’ feedback on the start time, 
duration, frequency, the topic of the writing, helpfulness of the study as well as the 
potential improvement in design), will be requested along with their re sponse to questions 
concerning the evidence of treatment implementation (including whether writing occurred, 
whether the minimum amount of writing duration/frequency, and the prescribed focus of 
the writing as well as the relevance to cancer diagnosis were met).  
 
 
b. Explore the intervention effects, calculate effect sizes of the outcome variables, and 
estimate the appropriate sample size for the main study.  
 
Mean changes in patients' self -esteem, spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being (at the scale and factor levels), 
anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as QOL (global, total score and each subscale) 
will be evaluated using regression models for longitudinal data (i.e., repe ated measures 
analysis of variance). The importance ratings for each subscale of the FACT -G and the 
FACIT -Sp-[ADDRESS_1014915]. Perceived threat at baseline and disease  progression at each 
follow -up data collection meeting  will be analyzed as moderator s for exploratory analysis ; 
psychosocial counseling or other supportive therapy/service/treatment received will be 
included as covariates.  SAS® software will be used to perform all the proposed analyses. 
For hypothesis testing, an alpha (α) of 0.05 will be selected.  
 
The standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d statistic), or effect size will be computed 
by [CONTACT_742483] (SD) at the baseline  (Kazis  et al. , 
1989) . In addition, raw score changes from baseline to follow -up will be assessed to 
interpret the clinical significance of the change by [CONTACT_742484] (M CID) (Jaeschke  et al., 1989 ) for 
Title:   Self-affirmation intervention for people newly diagnosed with advanced cancer:  A preliminary 
efficacy trial  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_742450]  
 
[ADDRESS_1014916] -G. Raw scores at the baseline and follow -up will be compared with the norm 
reference or thresholds for clinical consideration, if available in the literature.  
 
Although  psychological adaptation seems to be fundamentally independent from 
diagnostic group  (Cassileth et al., 1984) , treatment modality may exert an effect on quality 
of life outcomes (Oates  et al. , 2014) . The type of anticancer treatment patient received  
will be collected  from the patient’s chart; a nalysis of intervention effect and change over 
time will take treatment modality  (as well as the diagnostic group s) into consideration  (in 
subgroup or post -hoc exploratory analysis) . 
 
 
Specific Aim 2. Test the validity of the 12 -item functional assessment of chronic 
illness therapy - spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315] -being scale (FACIT -Sp-12), in its current and revised 
forms. 
To verify the understanding of the updated Factor items in the revised FACIT -Sp-12 and 
compare with the original scale, patients will be asked about their interpretation of the 
items in the Faith factor for both the original and revised scales  (Schuman, 1966) . 
 
Cronbach’s coefficient alpha will be computed to examine internal consistency reliability 
for both the revised and the original FACIT -Sp-12. The homogeneity of the total scale and 
three factors of Meaning, Peace and Faith will be examined by [CONTACT_742485] -item 
correlations, item -total correlations and item -rest correlations for both the original and 
revised FACIT -Sp-12. Construct validity will be explored b y assess ing the associations of 
the FACIT -Sp-12 (original and revised) with Q oL (global and total FAC T-G), self -esteem, 
and psychological distress (anxiety and depression).  
 
The threshold for the clinically important difference for the FACIT -Sp-12 at the scale and 
factor levels has not yet been reported in the literature. In this study, the M CIDs for scores 
of the scales and subscales from both the original and the revised FACIT -Sp-12 will be 
estimated using the criterion of global ratings of changes (GRC) on the five -point 
response categories (Cella et al., 2002) . 
 
In addition, to examine whether the associations between the individual items and any 
sample characteristic may differ, which could suggest item bias or differential item 
functioning  (Groenvold, Bjorner, Klee, & Kreiner, 1995) , the validities of the FACIT -Sp-12 
concerning the Faith factor will be further examined with the differential item functioning 
analysis in both the original and the revised FACIT -Sp-12. 
 
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations  
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and procedures.  This 
protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_697069] .

 Participants  will receive $ 25 in compensation for their time and effort at the end of each  
data collection meeting  (a total of $ 100 if the patient completes baseline and all the three 
follow -up data collections ). 
The informed consent of each subject, using IRB -approved consent materials , will be 
obtained before that subject begins  any study procedure s.  All subjects for this study will 
be provided a conse nt form on paper  describing this study in language understandable 
to the study population. Consent materials will provid e sufficient information for subjects 
to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.   The person obtaining 
consent will thoroughly explain what the subjects need to know about the study, including 
study requirements, study risks and benefits . The c onsent process will take place in a 
designated office for research  at the study sites . The consent discussion will occur  right 
before the planned study participation.  Participation privacy will be maintained and 
questions regarding participation will be answered.   No coercion or undue influence will 
be used in the consent process.  This consent form must be signe d by [CONTACT_742486].  The participant  will receive a copy of the signed consent 
form, and the informed consent process will be documented in the research record.   
The consent process will be documented separately via a written note in the research or 
medical chart for each subject.  
The study involves protected health information (PHI) as described in this protocol. 
Plans to protect identifiers are described in the Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_742466]. A partial HIPAA wavier for recruitment purposes is requested in order for PHI to  
be accessed/used for screening purposes.  
 
 
Dissemination of Data

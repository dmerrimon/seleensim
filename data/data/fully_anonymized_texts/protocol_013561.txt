For example, patients with pre-tr eatment PSAs of less than 6 ng/ml and Gleason scores less than 
or equal to 6, have 5-year bioc hemical control rates of 87%, whereas patients with PSAs 10 – 20 
ng/ml and Gleason scores of [ADDRESS_282923] control rates of only 45%. Radical prostatectomy outcomes 
are also influenced strongly by [CONTACT_86923] e same pre-treatment predictors. 
 It has long been felt that one of the most important factors limiting the success of radiation therapy 
has been the inability to deliver adequate radiation dose without producing unacceptable toxicity.  
More recently, however, innovations in cancer im aging, radiation treatment planning and treatment 
delivery technology have created opportunities for safe dose escalation.    
1.[ADDRESS_282924] indicated a substantial dose response for prostate cancer.  Hanks et al 
(1) examined Patterns of Care dat a and found actuarial local recurrence rates of 37% for Stage C 
patients treated to less than 60 Gy , 36% for doses of between 60-64.9 Gy, 28% for 65-69.9 Gy and 
19% for doses of 70 Gy or more .  Similarly, Perez et al (2) found 38% local recurrences for doses 
less than 60 Gy, 20% for doses between 60 and 70 Gy  and only 12 % for doses of 70 Gy or 
greater.  More recently, a number of retrospective studies (3-7) and one randomized trial (8) have 
demonstrated superior PSA recurrence-free survival when doses higher than [ADDRESS_282925] for intermediate or higher risk patients (Figure 1) .  These results and the unsatisfactorily 
high rates of disease persistence in intermediat e to higher risk patients after conventional dose 
radiation therapy (66-70 Gy) provi de a strong rationale for the deliver y of higher than conventional 
radiation doses.

 When delivered with conventionally planned techni ques, however, doses higher than 70 Gy are 
associated with higher complication risks (9). It has now become clea r that 3D conformal 
radiotherapy demonstrates better than historically expected tolerance of normal tissues to higher 
doses (6, 10, 11)  but complication rates, particularly rectal  bleeding, can still be substantial. Various 
analyses suggest that the total area of  rectal wall exposed to greater than 60 or 70 Gy predicts the 
rate of rectal bleeding or more severe grade 4 complications such as ulceration (Figure 2) . 
Therefore, the implementat ion of intensity modulat ed radiotherapy, with its ability to further reduce 
rectal irradiation, should further reduce toxiciti es, as has indeed been reported by [CONTACT_234177]. al. 
(12).

Version 9  6 With these advancements in delivery precision fo r radiation to a planned treatment volume, the 
minimizing of daily uncertainties regarding pati ent setup reproducibility and the change of position 
of the prostate within the pelvis because of rectal and/or bladder f illing takes on a significant role. 
Currently at the University of Wisconsin Department of Radiation Oncology, we are using an 
optically guided 3D-ultrasound tar get localization system (SonArrayTM, Zmed, Inc., Ashland, MA) to 
correct daily for these misalignments at the time of treatment to within 2 mm along each axis 
(Tome, in press, 2001). As an alternative, the implantation of small metal seeds into the prostate to 
serve as fiduciaries during daily portal imaging has  also proven reliable as a means of localizing 
the prostate  In addition, it has been demonstrated that the use of a rectal ball oon catheter can immobilize the 
prostate and facilitate localization on port films potentially allowing ti ghter margins for the treatment 
volume. Also, the lateral and posterior aspects of t he rectal wall are displace d out of the high dose 
region by [CONTACT_234178], which should offe r the potential for significant rectal sparing (14, 15) . 
  
1.[ADDRESS_282926] two years, 
however, of a unique prostate cancer radiobiology that may offer the opportunity to dramatically 
improve the efficiency and safety with wh ich radiation therapy is delivered.  
Conventional fractionation schemes employing frac tion sizes of 1.8 – 2.0 Gy are based upon the 
premise that tumors typi[INVESTIGATOR_234168] e to fractionation than are late-responding normal 
tissues.  The α/β ratios are one measure of fractionat ion response, with low ratios (high β ‘s) being 
more associated with late responding normal tiss ues, indicating greater repair between fractions 
with an accompanying greater relati ve sparing with small fraction sizes than for tumors with their 
higher α/β ratios.  Under these conditions, an improved therapeutic ratio is achieved with multiple 
small fractions.  In contrast, prostate cancers appear to be better
 able to repair radiation in jury than late responding 
normal tissues. This is probably related to the very  slow growth fractions and growth rates typi[INVESTIGATOR_234169]. Growth fraction (or av erage cell cycle time) has often been associated with 
fractionation response, with slowly  proliferating normal tissues ( and some slowly proliferating 
tumors) generally displaying strong fractionation responses (low α/β ratios).  This relationship has 
been demonstrated for melanomas (16) and for some sarcomas (17) , for example.  In the case of 
prostate cancer, there is ample evidence for slow proliferation, based both upon direct 
measurement of pot ential doubling times and labeling indices (18) and upon analysis of the kinetics 
of rising PSA during tumor recurrence (19).  Recent analyses of clinical tumor response data have 
argued for a low α/β ratio for prostate cancer as well (20, 21) . Brenner and Hall (20) , for example, 
analyzed dose response data for bot h external beam radiation and I-125 brachytherapy data and 
derived a very low α/β ratio of 1.5 Gy for prostate cancer.  Duschene and Peters (21) argue in 
analogous fashion that the α/β ratio for prostate cancer may be more similar to that expected for 
late responding normal tissue than for the typi [INVESTIGATOR_2855], more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_234170]. 
   RO [ZIP_CODE]

Version 9  7  
Our own analysis of tumor control versus dose response for external beam and brachytherapy also 
indicates a very low α/βratio of 1.49 (95% CI of 1.25 to 1.76) (22), significantly lower than the ratio 
of [ADDRESS_282927] late responding normal tissues. 
 
Under these unusual conditions, in which the α/β  ratio of the tumor is lower (the radiation repair 
capacity is higher) than that for t he limiting normal tissue, a new par adigm is created in which it 
becomes advantageous to use larger fractions; in ot her words, to use hypofractionation, rather 
than the traditionally larger number  of smaller fraction size radi ation treatments employed when 
treating most other tumor types.  In fact, the ol d way of fractionating woul d be the least efficient 
method.  Using the linear quadratic model, one can predict that it s hould be possible to improve the 
ratio of tumor control to normal tissue toxicity (the therapeutic ratio)  for prostate cancer by [CONTACT_234179]. 
 Although begun before this unique prostate cancer r adiobiology was understood, a relatively large 
clinical trial has already been ca rried out using hypofractionation for prostate cancer.  Cleveland 
Clinic investigators have carried out a trial of hypofra ctionation consisting of 28  fractions of 2.5 Gy 
each for a total dose of 70 Gy (23).  Intensity modulated radi otherapy (IMRT) and daily 
pretreatment ultrasound-based prosta te localization were employed to improve treatment precision 
and reduce radiation dose to the rect um.  These investigators are now  reporting 2-year follow-up in 
which rectal and bladder toxicities are no greater and likely lower that previously experienced with 
conventional fractionation of 2 Gy per day to 76 Gy using conventional 3D conformal radiotherapy 
techniques (Mohen, in press, 2002). Furthermore, t hese early results appear to indicate better 
tumor control (PSA recurrence-free survival) t hat was seen with standard fractionation, although 
follow-up is too short to reach definit ive conclusions regarding tumor control.
 1.[ADDRESS_282928] molecular alterations t hat render them poorly 
responsive to radiation therapy and that are associated with a signi ficant proportion of treatment 
failures. Preliminary findings indica te, for example, the status of certain biomarkers, such as p53, 
and Bcl-2, correlate with success or failure of radi ation therapy treatment for prostate cancer (30-
36) but more such studies are needed to further identify markers and to define the strength of 
these correlations with treatment outcome, particularly in favorabl
e or intermediate risk patients, 
the type of patient most frequently diagnosed today  and the type treated in this present study. 
 We will therefore study certain biomarkers in t he diagnostic biopsy specimens of patients treated 
on this protocol. These biomarkers hav e been selected based upon prognostically useful 
prevalences in early to intermediate risk pr ostate cancer and based upon their having pathways 
linked to radiation response. We will immunohistochemic ally measure the levels  of p53, Bcl-2,  and 
Ki-67 in pre-treatment diagnostic biopsy specimens from patients enrolled on this study and will 
analyze correlations between these markers and clin ical outcomes (freedom from biochemical and 
metastatic failure) in univariate and multivariate fashion, taking conventi onal prognosticators such 
as stage, grade and PSA into account.

treatment, or whether treatm ent frequency needs to be reduced.    The proposed study will 
therefore initiate treatm ent at each fraction size level with on ly [ADDRESS_282930] current, conventionally 
fractionated, dose escalation regimens.  Time and effort saved could be applied to upgrading 
pretreatment verification of  patient and organ position. 
 
Biomarker Study
 
The purpose of the biomarker study is to iden tify tumor biomarkers useful in predicting 
wh
ich prostate cancers are or are not likely to respond to radiation therapy. If successful, 
this proposed study will define biomarkers that are clinically useful in predicting response 
to radiation therapy in favorable-to-intermediat e risk patients.  This will provide insight into 
the mechanisms of resistance to radiation therapy and will potentially allow future 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including novel biologic/molecular therapy appro aches, to be prospectively 
individualized to optimize clinical outcome.   
 Participation in the tissue study is optional and is also dependent on the availability of tissue. The decision to participate in Biomar ker study will not affect nor influence any
 
patient treatment according to the remainder of  this hypofractionation protocol.  Subjects 
agreeing to tissue study participation will sign a consent indicating this decision.

 Patients will be enrolled on the hi ghest available dose level open to accrual.  If the highest dose 
level has reached full accrual with insufficient fo llow-up for further dose-per-fraction escalation, 
accrual will take place at one dose level lower, if one exists.

Enrollment will be permanently closed when the maximum tolerated dose per frac tion is reached or 
when the dose per fraction escalation is complete.     
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 5.1 General 
 
The accrual goal will be 50 evaluable patients in each of the three dose levels. An additional  100 
patients will be enrolled at the determined MTS (Maximum Tolerated Schedule). An exception to 
this accrual target will be made for any new institut ional participant joining the trial after Level I 
accrual has been completed, in which case that institution will  treat two patie nts to completion at 
Level I (22 fractions, 5 treatments a week) irrespec tive of the current  hypofractionation level the 
overall trial currently is treati ng. After two such patients have been treated, these institutions will 
then be allowed to accrue to the Level currently open in the trial. In addition, if the highest dose 
level has reached full accrual with insufficient fo llow-up for further dose-per-fraction escalation, 
accrual will take place at one dose level lower.  
As a result, patients will be enrolled on the highest 
available dose level open to accrual.    Both acute and late toxicities will be monitored and will dictate subsequent accrual.  The level of 
acute toxicity observed will dictate the number of fractions delivered per week, whereas the level of 
late toxicities will determine both whether accrual to a dose-per-fraction level is continued and 
whether escalation to the next dose-per-fraction leve l is allowed. The escala tion rules are as stated 
in 5.2 and 5.3, with the statistical rationale being described in Section 8.  Given this study design, 
predicting the overall number of patients accrued is difficult.  Assuming we are able to complete 
Levels 1-3 without dose limiting toxi city and taking into account the possibility of further enrollment 
into a lower dose level per escalation rules, the enrollment could be as high as 400 patients.   
 
5.2  Dose-per fraction escalation 
 
Escalation to the next higher dose-per-fraction leve l (or the accrual of an additional 100 patients to 
the MTS) will only be allowed when there is at leas t [ADDRESS_282932] 12 m onths.  A rate of 20% grade 2 or higher  late rectal 
toxicity per patient follow-up y ear will be considered dose limiting. Late toxicities will be scored > 90 
days from completion of therapy.  The statis tical rationale and methodol ogy for this dose-per-
fraction escalation strategy is described in section 8. 0.  Of note, statistical fl uctuations in measured 
toxicity rates could occasionally lead to an init ial over- or underestimation of these rates.  
Therefore, cumulative toxicity rates will be updated every 6 months throughout the life of the 
protocol and will be utilized accordi ng to the rules stated above. 
 The expected accrual timetable, the proposed dos e-per-fraction and total fraction levels, and 
patient accrual goals for this phase I/II trial are shown in Table 1 below.

 All of the three above levels ar e predicted to be approximately isoeffective for late effects at BED

predicted to produce about the same level of late toxi city, all other factors such as high dose rectal 
wall volume remaining constant.  Furthermore, the above schemas are all predicted to produce the 
same late toxicity as the fractionation regi men successfully pi[INVESTIGATOR_234171] (23) of 
2.[ADDRESS_282933] 10 patients enrolled at each 
fraction size level will receive either 3 or 4 fx/week, depending upon how well tolerated previous 
fractionation levels and weekly treatment frequenc ies were tolerated. Acute toxicities will be 
reanalyzed and acted upon if necessary for subsequent  groups of [ADDRESS_282934] 10  patients at each hypofractionation level, ≥20% acute grade 3 or higher 
GI or GU toxicity will constitute a threshold toxi city level and will dictate a decrease in frequency of 
treatment by [CONTACT_234183] w eek for the next 10 patients to be treated at that hypofractionation 
level. If > 20% acute toxicity is also observed in this second gr oup of 10 patients,  treatment 
frequency will be further reduced by [CONTACT_234184].  If excess toxicity is not seen after changing to a  lower treatment 
frequency, then all remaining patients in that hypof ractionation level will continue to be treated at 
that frequency. 
• If exactly 20% of patients wit hin the first group of ten patients at any hypofractionation 
level experiences acute grade III or higher GI or GU toxicity, then the next ten patients at 
that hypofractionation level will remain at  the same weekly frequency of treatment,

1/11/[ADDRESS_282935] to the usual treatment frequency de-e scalation if excess acute toxicities are 
observed. 
 
• If < 20% of the first ten pati ents within the level experience th is threshold toxi cities, then 
the subsequent patients will be tr eated at the next higher treat ment frequency sublevel, 
again subject to de-escalation if excess acute toxicities are observed. 
 
• For an individual patient who develops acute to xicity at or above the Grade 3 level, that 
patient will be placed on treatment break fo r one week and treatments will then resume 
at the next lower treatment frequency.  For ex ample, if that patie nt was being treated 4 
times per week at the time  grade 3 or higher acute toxicities developed, he would 
subsequently be treated 3 times per week.  A longer treatment br eak can also be 
prescribed if the treating physician feels 
that it is clinically indicated. 
 
• At any hypofractionation level, a reduction in treatment frequency to two fractions per 
week will be allowed for a given patient if that patient exper iences a threshold or higher 
toxicity at 3 fractions per week. 
 
 
• Acute toxicities will be scored from the start of treatment through [ADDRESS_282936] scan.  Seminal vesicles will be in cluded in the GTV for 75% of the prescription 
dose if the estimated risk for se minal vesicle involvement is ≥15% (24). For situations where there 
is less than 15% risk of seminal vesicle involvem ent, the base of the semi nal vesicles may be 
included in the GTV at the discret ion of the treating physician.  The CTV will represent the same 
volume as the GTV plus a 0.3 cm margin in all di mensions except at the pr ostate-rectal interface, 
for which a margin of between 0 and 0.3 cm can be used. The PTV will include the CTV with a 
margin to account for patient and organ motion.  This margin beyond the CTV is expected to range 
between 0 – 0.[ADDRESS_282937] (using Tomotherapy) or fiducial markers. Block margins will be 
chosen to provide adequate coverage of the PT V with no more than 10 % dose heterogeneity 
across the PTV.  At least 95% of  the PTV must receive the pre scription dose or higher.  All 
planning will be carried out using an intensity modul ated radiation therapy treatment planning

5.6.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events (SAE) will be defined as all Grade 4 and Grade 5 toxicity. SAE’S will be 
phoned in to the Study Chairman at [PHONE_4884] within one working day of the event.   SAE’s will 
be reported by [CONTACT_234186] s to the DSMB and the Clinical Trials Monitoring Committee 
administrator within one business day of notification of SAE.  These will also be discussed at 
regularly scheduled Disease Oriented Working Group meetings. 
 
5.6.4 Quality of Life  
Quality of life will be assessed by  [CONTACT_234187], 
bladder, and erectile function. Questionnaires will be performed prior to treatment, one , two and 
three  years after completion of treatment.  Overall quality of life will be assessed using The Spi[INVESTIGATOR_234174] (SQLI) (26).  Bowel and bladder quality of life will be assessed using a 
questionnaire developed at Fox Chase Cancer Center (27).  Erectile function will be assessed

Version 9  15 using the International Index of Er ectile Function Questionnaire (IIEF) (28).  Data will be used to 
compare these patients to those who received conventional external beam radiation therapy. 
  
5.7  Supportive Care 
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care  will be given throughout the study.  
 
5.8  Duration of Therapy
 
 
Study treatment will be stopped if: 
• The patient refuses the study treatment 
• The patient’s physician feels that continuing the study treat ments would not be in the 
patient’s best interest. 
• The patient experiences severe treatment rela ted toxicities as outlined in section 5.6.3. 
• There is clear evidence of progressive disease. 
• Treatment interruption more than [ADDRESS_282940] markers (e.g., p53, bcl-2, bax and mdm-2).   The apoptotic markers are all involved in 
molecular radiation response pathways and have s hown promise in predict ing prostate cancer 
patient outcome after radiotherapy , while the proliferation marker , Ki-67, may have particular 
relevance for hypofractionation since the slow proliferation typi[INVESTIGATOR_234175] a 
hypofractionated radiotherapy appr oach. All of these markers will be determined by [CONTACT_234188], using the ACIS Chromavisi on system, as has been us ed, for example, in 
immunohistochemistry studies carried out in RTOG 86-10 (37).  
 Clinical outcomes (biochemical control) determined from the trial described  here will not be ready 
for correlative analysis comparisons with these biom arker analysis for approximately [ADDRESS_282941]  
 
6.1 General  
 
The primary objectives of this  study are to potentially establish the maximum tolerated 
hypofractionation intensity (or to determine whet her the most hypofractionated schedule tested in 
this study is tolerated) for prostate cancer patients and to determine clinical response. Analyses for 
   RO [ZIP_CODE]

Version 9  16 clinical tumor control and PSA disease free surv ival will be performed when median 5-year follow-
up is obtained. Data will be collected for efficacy evaluation as stated in section 6.2 and 6.3. 
 
6.2 Disease-free Status  
 
Patients will be considered to be without biochemical recurrence if either the PSA is still declining 
or the PSA nadir has been reached and is below 1.0 ng/mL, there is no palpable or radiologic 
evidence of disease, PSA is not rising (defined as  [ADDRESS_282942] two months apart) and there is no evidence of metastasis.  Patients not meeting 
these criteria will be judged to have a recurrence.

of the 4 week and all annual follow-ups, can be conduc ted via telephone interview with PSA and any other 
indicated testing being carried out at a facility near to the patient.

Version 9  17 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
8.1 Treatment and Toxicities 
 
This phase I/II trial will be conducted with three potential fraction size levels, wit h a potential of 50 
patients per level (plus an additional  100 patients at MTS if permitted by [CONTACT_234190]) and 
an accrual rate of approximately 50 patients per year ant icipated. This may estimate the maximum 
tolerated dose-per-fraction (MTD), defined as that fractionation schema that yields at most a 40% 
rate of late grade 2 rectal toxicity at 2 years. A modified LENT grading system  for rectal toxicity will 
be used (28). That outcome is chosen for its clinical relevance; howev er, the extended follow-up 
makes the standard sequential designs  impractically long at 3 year s (one year accrual plus two 
years follow-up for each of three cohorts). We ther efore use the simply modi fied class of prorated 
designs (R. Chappell and K. Cheung, Simple designs  for phase I clinical trials of long-term 
toxicities, abstract presented at the 1998 meeting of the Society fo r Clinical Trials). Proration 
implies, for example, that two patients observed for one year each, constituting two patient-years of follow-up, are equivalent in info rmation to one patient followed for two years. This implicitly uses 
the result of Teshima (29) that  the cumulative incidence of late grade 2 rectal complications 
reaches 50% of the final value wit hin twelve months of treatment and that the cumulative incidence 
of complications is approximately linear with time.  The prorated design will require the following conditi ons for escalation: at least twenty patient-
years of observation; and a minimum of 5 pati ents followed for one year ; and at most a 40% 
toxicity rate per two years (i.e., at most 2 toxicities per 10 patient -years) observed. Proration allows 
a great reduction in the overall ti me of the trial - with fifty pati ents accrued at a uniform rate over 
each year, the first two conditions will be satisfied after [ADDRESS_282947] 45 months. The requirem ent of 5 patients being followed for one year is made for safety's 
sake. The situation may arise that the maximum 50 patients hav e been accrued at a particular 
dose-per-fraction step, but there is insufficient follow-up to allo w escalation to the next dose-per-
fraction step. Under these circum stances, additional patients may be accrued at the previous (next 
lower) dose-per-fraction level until follow-up conditions for the next escalation are met. 
 
8.2 Disease-free 
Survival 
 
A primary endpoint is Disease-Free Survival (DFS ), as defined in Section 6.2.  The 95% 
confidence interval for DFS observed on [ADDRESS_282948] half-width of 8% or 
less; that is, it will be the observed DFS rate plus  or minus 8%.  This figure is conservative 
in that the width will be less for DFS rates far from 50%.  It is slightly anticonservative in the presence of loss to follow-up.  The DFS estimate and its confidence interval will be compared to similar statistics observed for 
patients treated with standard care fractionation schedules such as those presented in [Zelefsky et 
al. High dose rate radiotherapy delivered by [CONTACT_234191], J. Ur ol. 166: 876, 2001].  In addition, efficacy in these 
data will be modeled with the linear-quadratic formula [Chappell, R., Nondahl, D., and Fowler, J.F.  
Modeling dose and local control in radiotherapy. Jour nal of the American Statistical Association.  
Vol. 90 (1995), pp. 829-838] to ex amine the hypothesis, which underlies the logic of fractionation, 
that prostate cancers have an alpha/beta ratio wh ich makes them better able to repair radiation 
injury than surrounding late responding tissues.

8.3 Correlation of Biomarkers with Clinical Outcome 
 
The percent labeling observed i mmunohistochemically with each biomarker studied will ultimately 
be analyzed for correlations with clinical outcome once sufficient clinical follow-up is achieved 
(median follow-up of at least 5 years. Three markers (p53, bcl-2, and Ki-67) will be analyzed for 
prognostic significance using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis accounting for each of the 250 
patients' follow-ups, and adjusting for pretreatment PSA and tumor grade.  For purposes of power calculations only, we will assume that marker scores will be divided at their medians and modeled as binary covariates, so that prevalences are by [CONTACT_108] 50%.  Also, we compute power using binary failure/no-failure five year outcomes; these produce conservative (slightly too small) estimates of power.  We invoke the usual two-sided test of significance at the conducted .05 level, divided by [CONTACT_234192] a Bonferroni adjustment to avoid bias due to multiple comparisons. 
  Suppose that the relative risk induced by [CONTACT_234193] 3.  This, by [CONTACT_234194], implies five-year failure rates of approximately 22% vs. 8% which average to 15%, a failure rate consistent with that reported in a patient population such as this treated with dose-escalated radiotherapy.  Then by [CONTACT_234195]'s effect, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, is approximately 79%.  This is  reasonable for an exploratory study. Should failure 
rates be higher than the assumed 15%, then the power would be greater.
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_282949] (DSMB) has been formally constituted for the “Improving Cancer Outcome With Adaptive Helical Tomotherapy” NIH gr ant.  The DSMB consists of one statistician 
who will chair the Board (Associate [CONTACT_234200], Ph.D.), one radiation oncologist 
([CONTACT_234201], Ph.D., M.D. ), and one medical physicist (Heath Odau).  
None of these individuals are involved with this  study.  The DSMB meetings will be held semi-
annually and more often depending on the nature and pr ogress of the trial.  The DSMB will be 
responsible for recommendations regarding specific actions or no action for the continuing conduct 
of this trial.  The DSMB will be notified immediatel y (within 24 hours) if any grade 4-5 toxicities are 
observed.  
 
 9.0 DATA COLLECTION  
This protocol will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.  Participating 
investigators/institutions  agree to permit trial related monito ring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory 
inspections, providing direct access to source documents/data.

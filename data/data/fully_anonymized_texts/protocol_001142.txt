Study Population: Living or deceased donor kidney  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 18 to 80 years of age.  
 
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled / Randomized: 50 patients [25 patients in each arm]  
 
Study Design Overview:  
This is a one year, prospective, randomized, open -label trial examining once versus tw ice daily tacrolimus dosing 
regimen using two preparations, Envarsus vs Prograf. It will examine kidney function between the two groups using 
eGFR and also examine one year kidney outcomes, including graft loss and patient death. Biopsy will be performed o n 
clinical indications only (not protocol) when rejection or other problem is suspected in face of deteriorating  renal 
function in each study group utilizing Banff criteria. Patients will be screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1089546] immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of

Treatments  
Study participants will receive either Envarsus (single daily dose) or SOC, twice daily, immediate -release tacrolimus for 1 
year following their transplant procedure. Because of its extended -release pharmacokinetics, it is critical that Envarsus 
be initiated at a dose of 0.12/mg/kg/day as a sin gle daily dose.  After the initial dose, Envarsus dosing will be titrated 
according to the clinical judgment of the attending physician and appropriate TDM of tacrolimus trough concentrations.  
This dosing should account for the fact that when identical tr ough levels are targeted, systemic exposure to tacrolimus is 
the same for both Prograf and Envarsus. Patients receiving immediate -release tacrolimus should be initiated on therapy 
per center protocol which is 0.1 mg/kg/day. After initial dosing, subsequent  dosing in patients receiving either Envarsus 
or immediate -release tacrolimus should be predicated on clinical experience, patient tolerability, and monitoring of 
whole blood tacrolimus drug concentrations, the measurement of which, along with target tacro limus levels, will be 
guided by [CONTACT_790546].   
Study subjects will be counseled on the need to exhibit 100% compliance with their medication regimen in a manner 
that reflects a center’s own standard of care.   
Investigational Product  and Dosing : 
Tacrolimus, extended -release, oral (Envarsus); 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 4 mg tablets  
Administered once daily at initial weight -based dose of  0.12  mg/kg. Dosing and monitoring thereafter predicated on 
clinical judgment to a minimum whole blood tacrolimus concentration of at least 8 ng/mL.  When possible, patients will 
receive their daily dose of Envarsus using the fewest number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_790526].

 Comparative Drug  and Dosing : 
Tacrolimus immediate -release, oral; 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 5 mg capsules  
Administered twice daily per clin ical judgment of supervising physician (dosing and monitoring in accordance with 
center protocol) to a minimum whole blood tacrolimus concentration of at least 8 ng/mL.  
 
Concomitant Medication s: 
All patients will receive induction immunotherapy (either T -cell depleting agent or IL -2 co-stimulation blocker). The dose 
and frequency of the chosen induction agent will be determined by [CONTACT_102]’s treating physician and administered in 
conjunction with the participating transplant center’s de novo  kidney immun osuppression protocol. As a participant in 
this study, in addition to tacrolimus, study subjects will need to concomitantly receive mycophenolate sodium (or MMF 
equivalent). Anti-CMV, fungal, bacterial, and pneumocystis prophylaxis will follow standard of care. Non -tacrolimus 
based immunosuppressive regimens (i.e. cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, belatacept), as well as all forms of 
extended -release tacrolimus other than Enva rsus, are prohibited during the course of the study.  Measures to Treat 
Rejections:  The need for therapy to treat rejection will be determined by [CONTACT_790547]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_790527], but are not limited to rabbit anti -thymocyte globulin, intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG), rit uximab, and eculizumab.  
 
Duration of Treatment:  
Study enrollees will receive study medication (single daily dose of Envarsus or standard of care twice daily, immediate -
release tacrolimus) for up to one year following their transplant procedure.  
 
Formal Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  
A decision to terminate the study early will be based  on the event rate of rejections or AE's as determined by [CONTACT_790548], surgeons, and transplant 
coor dinators which meets monthly. The study duration will be such that patients will complete at least one year of study 
visits. Interim data analysis will be performed once all patients complete 6 months of study and final analysis will be 
performed when all patients complete 12 months of study.  
 
Discontinuation Criteria from Treatment for Individual Subjects:    
Subject develops allograft loss (as defined by [CONTACT_619908], re -transplantation, transplant nephrectomy, or return to 
dialysis of ≥ 6 consecutive wee ks);  
Subject develops unacceptable toxicity or is withdrawn at the discretion of the patient’s supervising physician;  
Subject is lost to follow -up despi[INVESTIGATOR_106283];  
Subject withdraws consent for furthe r treatment;  
Conversion to a non -tacrolimus -based maintenance regimen in either study arm if required to manage toxicities . 
 
Endpoints for Evaluation:  
Primary : To compare the relationship of once daily tacrolimus extended release (Envarsus) versus twice da ily tacrolimus 
immediate release (Prograf) doses to achieve target trough concentrations (C) relative to the total daily dose (D) given

concentration to dose ratio (C/D ratio).  
 
Secondary : Comparison between treatment cohorts regarding incidence will rely upon assessments for each of the 
following results:  
 Compare incidence of rejection between the groups at [ADDRESS_1089555] -transplan t (Banff grade I -III and 
antibody mediated rejection [AMR])  
 Compare graft loss and death within [ADDRESS_1089556] -transplant  
 Compare and summarize serious adverse events (AEs) between study groups  
 Death within [ADDRESS_1089557] -transplant  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Sample Size: The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_790528] C/D ratio in each 
patient group will correlate directly with eGFR. We expect to see a trend suggestive that the Envarsus group by [CONTACT_790549] -induced 
nephrotoxicity and therefore result in a better e -GFR. This is not likely to be statistically significant in this inadequately 
powered study since the variabilit y in donor organs themselves, as well as many other variables, will not permit a precise 
analysis in this small study sample. However, stratification for living donors and deceased donors may provide important 
trends in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_790529].  The statistical summary and analysis of safety data, will consist of all subjects who enrolled into the study 
and took at least one dose of study medication.  Demograph ics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Descriptive statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum) and inter -
quartile range, coefficient of variation, and geometric mean will be provided for t acrolimus dose and whole blood 
concentrations of tacrolimus for both study cohorts. Tacrolimus concentrations will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics. The analysis of efficacy regarding C/D effectiveness in relation to number of rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] a nd outcomes 
at various stated time points will be conducted using Student T test.  The association between whole blood 
concentrations and the following endpoints will be assessed: rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_790530], histopathology (Banff 
classification) and convent ional measures of transplant outcomes.  
H0: The probability of incidence for the primary endpoint is the same between patients receiving Envarsus and patients 
receiving immediate -release tacrolimus.  
Safety:  All adverse events (AE)  will be listed.  The numb er and percentage of AEs, significant AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and AEs related to study drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The number and percentage of 
AEs by [CONTACT_790550].

 Patient Recruitment  
Living Donor Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] : Research subjects for a living donor kidney will be recruited from the cl inical practice of the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20040]. All potential subjects are patients of members of the study team. The research 
coordinator will do a preparatory to research (allowed with HIPAA Form D) by [CONTACT_790552] i f 
they meet criteria for the study. If they meet the eligibility criteria, the transplant physician, nephrologist or transplant  
coordinator will explain the basics of the study to the patient during the pre -transplant clinic visit , during the pre -
operative  visit, or over the phone.  If the patient agrees to speak with the research team further about the study , the 
investigator or research coordinator will continue the informed consent process. Patients  receiving living donor 
transplants  will not be first approached for research the same day of transplant. All subjects will sign consent prior to 
any research activities take place .  
Deceased Donor Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:  This study calls for consenting deceased donor renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_790531]. Today, the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney transplant is up to [ADDRESS_1089561] by  a clinician involved in the patient’s care, most likely the 
transplant physician . If the subject is interested in learning more about the study, the research coordinator will explain 
the study in detail, and give the patient ample opportunity to ask quest ions about the study prior to surgery. The study 
will only be introduced while the patient is in the admitting area, in the outpatient clinic, or the outpatient counseling 
center. If the study has not been introduced by [CONTACT_790553] (the last step before they go 
to the operating room), the study will not be introduced. The study will be posted on the Department of Surgery website 
and on clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
Background   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_790532] -term imp rovements in patient and graft survival, the rate of late allograft 
loss following kidney transplantation has remained unchanged [Lamb et al, 2011; Kaneku and Terasaki, 2006].  The link 
between chronic nephrotoxicity and the use of CN Is has proven somewhat  elusive [Shihab et al, 2008; Ekberg, Grinyo,  et 
al, 2007; Naesens et al, 2007; Nankivell et al, 2004; Seron et al, 2002].  Late allograft injury as evidenced by [CONTACT_60142] -to-
severe arteriolar hyalinosis (a hallmark of CNI nephrotoxicity) is found to a simi lar extent in patients never exposed to CNIs 
at 5 years [Stegall et al, 2011]. Achievement of therapeutic, minimally toxic, tacolimus  concentrations early (within 30 
days), after transplantation, is known to be important since achieving it has been associa ted with a lowered risk of acute 
rejection. We hypothesize that using extended release tacrolimus ( Envarsus , Veloxis), will provide more stable, more 
effective, and less toxic levels of tacrolimus in renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. It is of high clinical impor tance to identify factors 
which can predict who is endangered to develop CNI toxicity. In a recent report Gerold Tholking et al , (Ann Transplant, 
2016 ) hypothesized that the TAC metabolism rate expressed as the blood concentration normalized by [CONTACT_121287] (C /D 
ratio) is a simple predictor. Therefore, we propose to analyze the impact of the C/D ratio on kidney function after renal 
transplantation in experimental group that will be treated with Envarsus  and the SOC group treated with twice a day 
Prograf. Renal function will be analyzed [ADDRESS_1089562] of care (SOC) 
treatment with immediate release  TAC administered twice a day. Such randomized study in various well defined patient

Columbia University Medical Center                                                           9 of 16 
 populations (race, sex, age, and diabetes) should provide evidence for possible greater efficiency and lesser toxicity of 
extended release drug, Envarsus, as compared to S OC treatment with immediate release tacrolimus  given twice per day. 
Envarsus is an oral, extended -release formulation of tacrolimus developed to enable a once daily dosing regimen . It 
decreases intra -patient variability  and offers flatter kinetics which sh ould ensure a more consistent immunosuppression 
exposure over the long -term without unpredictable high peaks which may be related to higher toxicity rate, including 
nephrotoxicity. There is little doubt that the once daily dosing has been described as impr oving medication adherence 
[Sabbatini et al, 2014; Doesch et al, 2013; Eberlin et al, 2013; Kuypers et al, 2013].  
Since Tacrolimus, the mainstay of immunosuppression in renal transplant patients is known for drug induced 
nephrotoxicity, which may limit gr aft survival we propose a prospective randomized study to analyze the relationship of 
tacrolimus doses to achieve target trough levels (C/D) and renal function at different time -points after transplantation. 
In this analysis,  all 1:1 randomized renal allog raft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_790533] (Prograf ) in the SOC treated controls or with Envarsus  in the experimental group. Renal function 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_443229] (eGFR MDRD).  Such a prospective , randomized, controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_790534] a day Tacrolimus ( Envarsus ) vs. twice a day Tacrolimus (Prograf) to test the hypothesis that the 
consistency of immunosuppression with Envarsus increases the C/D ratio, i.e. get effective stab le trough levels with 
lower total Tacrolimus dose given as Envarsus , and lead to better eGFR, and reduce the likelihood of nephrotoxicity 
(lower total Tacrolimus exposure). In the course of this study, patients in the control arm will receive immediate -release 
formulations of tacrolimus in accordance with local SOC dispensing practices, thus preserving the real -world conditions 
in which the patient could receive any manufacturer’s approved product.  In this manner, it is hoped that this research 
will improv e the understanding of chronic calcineurin inhibitor injury  and provide greater insight into how tacrolimus 
exposure impacts long term, and even short term, renal function (eGFR).  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Following oral administration, tacrolimus is generally rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584] (t max) in approximately 1.5 hours . The mean oral 
bioavailability is low,  approximately 20 %, with a large amount of variation between individuals. In plasma, the drug is 
highly bound to plasma proteins (serum albumin and alpha -1-acid glycop rotein ). Tacrolimus has a large volume of 
distribution  and is cleared by [CONTACT_171339] - CYP3A system  and p-glycoprotein, which decreases oral bioavailability 
of tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is primarily eliminated in the bile.  Tacrolimus is an active substa nce with a narrow therapeutic 
index which requires regular monitoring to establish and maintain appropriate drug exposure. Immunosuppressive 
therapy with tacrolimus is usually initiated as a weight -based dose and adjusted on the basis of tacrolimus whole b lood 
trough concentration monitoring. To ensure that appropriate systemic exposure is achieved, the prevailing practice is to 
conduct TDM based on the trough whole blood concentrations (Cmin). Although tacrolimus systemic exposure (AUC) is 
the critical par ameter for both safety and efficacy in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [Kuypers et al, 2004; Undre et al, 1999], AUC 
monitoring is not feasible in clinical practice. For this reason, Cmin (trough concentration) is used as a surrogate for 
overall exposure. For both E nvarsus and Prograf formulations, the established trough concentration goals can be used to 
target the same systemic exposure level.

rejection, to a cyclosporine -based regimen. The efficacy of Enva rsus in adult kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_790535] -inferior to Prograf.   
 
Overall Safety Profile  
The safety profile of Prograf has been established; c linically important events include impairment of renal function, 
abnormal glucose m etabolism, and neurological disorders. Many of the adverse drug reactions are reversible and/or 
responded to dose reduction. Transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy are also known to be at increased risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_118281] -transplant lymphoprolife rative disorders and other malignancies.  This risk is considered to be related 
to the overall immunosuppressive burden. The adverse events observed following administration of Envarsus in kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_790536] s afety profile of Prograf.  No new adverse events that would 
suggest a clinical concern were identified.  
 
Study Design   
This is an exploratory, pi[INVESTIGATOR_790537], prospective, randomized, open -label trial examining long -term kidney transplant 
outcomes. Specifi cally, it is designed to compare the effects of twice daily, immediate -release tacrolimus and once daily

 Study Visits  
Screening Period  
The screening period can be any time from 21 days be fore your transplant until the day of transplant. At the screening 
visit, the following procedures and tests will be performed:  
 -A review of current health status, medica l and surgical history, and list of medications  
-Collection of blood samples for cli nical purposes.  
-A physical examination (including height and weight)  
- Questions about any side effects that may occur from the medications taken .  
-Female participants who are able to have children will also have a pregnancy test (either from a blood dr aw or a urine 
sample) within the [ADDRESS_1089567] on the day of transplant . 
For living donors, randomization procedures may take pla ce on the day of transplant.  
 
Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to two open label treatment arms  in a 1:1 ratio  by a computer program . The two treatment 
arms are: Treatment Arm 1: Study medication is once daily Envarsus, or slow -release tacrolimus ; Treatment Arm 2: Study 
medication is twice daily, Prograf, or immediate -release tacrolimus . Randomi zation will happen the day of transplant to 
ensure all questions have been answered prior to surgery  and the subject wishes to remain in the study .  
Subjec ts randomized to Envarsus  will need to take the study medication once a day at the same time each day, by [CONTACT_1966].  
For both treatment arms, the medications that you take in preparation for your kidney transplant (“induction therapy”) 
and the other medication s that the study medication needs to be taken with (including steroids and mycophenolate 
mofetil [MMF]) will be given to you in the way your doctor normally gives them. These medicines will not be paid for or 
reimbursed by [CONTACT_790557]. ONLY the study 
medication Envarsus will be provided to you by [CONTACT_790558].  
 
 
Follow Ups  
Both Arms of the study will have the same [ADDRESS_1089568] with the research staff.   
At these visits, the following study procedures and tests will occur:  
• A review of any medications you take  
• Adverse Events rev iew  
• Arm 1 (Envarsus) only: R eturn any used and unused bottles of study drug (week 52 only)

Study drug accountability throughout the study must be documented and reconciled. The following guidelines are 
therefore pertinent: ● The investigator agrees not to supply study drugs to any persons except the eligible subjects in 
this study in accordance with the protocol. ● The investigator or designee will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy, 
accessible only to those authorized by [CONTACT_43073] d ispense these test drugs. ● A study drug inventory will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_1719]. The inventory will include details of material received and a clear record of 
when they were dispensed and to which subject. Appropriate forms of deliver ies and returns must be signed by [CONTACT_790559]. ● The site will return study drug to the Sponsor at the end of the study or upon 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].

participation in the study. A subset of the routine laboratory assessments obtained per SOC, including creatinine, 
hemoglobin , hematocrit; platelet count; white blood cell count; serum sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, 
urinalysis  (including urinary protein), tacrolimus trough concentrations.   
 
Physical Examination   
A complete physical exam will be conducted at screening.  Any abnormal findings must be assesse d and documented as 
not clinically significant if a subject is to be enrolled in the study.  The investigator or qualified designee will conduct the 
exam, determine findings, and assess any abnormalities as to clinical significance.  
 
Causal relationship to  the study drug may  be:                          
1. Not Related  in which case a clinical event, including laboratory te st abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug 
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and/or in which other d rugs, chemicals, or underlying 
disease provide plausible explanations.  
2. Possible  in which case a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by c oncurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
3. Probable  in which case a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the drug, unli kely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which 
follows a clinically reasonable response on re -administration (rechallenge) or withdrawal.  
 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)   
In the case  of a serious adverse even t (SAE), the investigator must contact [CONTACT_790563] (within 24 hours of awareness). Full details of the SAE should be recorded on the medical records, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_790540] (Veloxis).  
The following minimum information is required: ● Internal Study number, ● Subject number, sex, and age, ● Date of 
report, ● Description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event), and ● Causal relationship to the study drug.  
All AEs occurring after informed consent is signed should be collected and recorded in the electronic chart. All new SAEs 
and Adverse Drug Reactions (non -serious and serious AEs related to systemic tacrolimus)  will be captured and recorded 
in the medical record.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Events   
All AEs occurring during the study are to be followed up until resolved or judged to be no longer clinically significant, or 
until they become chronic to the extent that they c an be fully characterized. If during AE follow -up, the adverse event 
progresses to an "SAE", or if a subject experiences a new SAE, the investigator must immediately report the information 
to the Sponsor.  Local IRB will inform the investigator that some ev ents reported as SAEs may not require expedited 
reporting to the IRB. The Sponsor will monitor these events throughout the course of the study.

reason and at any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or  prejudice. The investigator is also free 
to terminate a subject's involvement in the study at any time if the subject's clinical condition warrants.  
Discontinuation Criteria from Treatment for Individual Subjects:   
● Subject develops allograft loss (death, re -transplantation, transplant nephre ctomy, or return to dialysis ≥ 6 
consecutive weeks);  
● Subject develops unacceptable toxicity or is withdrawn at the discretion of the patient’s supervising physician;  
● Subject is lost to follow -up despi[INVESTIGATOR_790541];  
● Subject withdraws consent for further treatment or expi[INVESTIGATOR_790542];  
● Conversion to a non -tacrolimus -based maintenance regimen in either study arm if required to manage to xicities;  
 
OPERATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS   
Data Collection   
The investigator or site designee will enter data collected using the local Electronic Medical Record (EMR ) system s. In 
the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner , the investigator or site designee should record data , 
including local laboratory values , in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790543] 
(Eclips ys EMR) or office visit form  (Crown) within 5days after the subject v isit. The investigator or site designee is 
responsible to ensure that all data in the EMR  are recorded within 5 days of the visit.  Source data will be available at the 
site in the two EMR (inpatient - Eclipsys and o utpatient - Crown in the Allscript  System). Source data will include the 
medical treatment and history of the subject. The followi ng information will be included : ● Demographic data (age, sex, 
race, ethni city, height and body weight) ● Cross -match results ● Separate donor source data inclu ding donor 
demographics, KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_790544] ● Participation in study and original signed and dated 
informed consent ● Visit dates ● Medical history and physical examination details ● Adverse events(including causality)  
and concomitan t medication ● Results of relevant examinations when appropriate ● Laboratory tests  ● Reason for 
premature discontinuation (if applicable) ● Randomization number  
 
Direct Access to Source Data/Documents  
The investigator and the study site will provide ass istance for any monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_430489], as well as 
inspections from the IRB relevant regulatory authorities as requested. In these instances, the investigator or his designee 
will assist at the review of all study -related records, without allow ing independent access to the records per the rules of

regulations when the source documents are subject to inspection.  
 
Protocol Devi ations   
A protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not implemented or intended as a 
systematic change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluat ions described in this protocol and for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects. The 
investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to, the protocol, unless it is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to trial subjects . For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring notification to Sponsor and to 
the local IRB are defined as any subject who: ● Entered into the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria. ● 
Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose. ●  Received excluded concomitant treatment. When a deviation from the 
protocol is identified, the investigator or designee must ensure that local IRB is notified.  
 
Documents and Records Related to the Clinical Study   
The investigator will archive all study data in the patient's electronic data chart (e.g., Subject Identification Code List, 
source data, and eGFR,) and relevant correspondence. Data generated by [CONTACT_790564]' medical records and/or study  progress notes.  
 
Protocol Amendment and/or Revision  
Any changes to the study that arise after approval of the protocol must be documented as protocol amendments. 
Depending on the nature of the amendment, either IRB approval or notification may be requir ed. The changes will 
become effective only after the approval of Veloxis, the investigator, and the IRB. Amendments to this protocol must be 
signed by [CONTACT_790565]. Written verification of IRB approval will be obtained before any amendment is 
implemented which affects subject safety or the evaluation of safety, and/or efficacy. Modifications to the protocol that 
are administrative in nature do not require IRB, but will be submitted to the IRB for their information. If there are 
changes to th e Informed Consent, written verification of IRB approval must be forw arded to Veloxis. An appr oved copy 
of the new Informed Co nsent must also be forwarded to Veloxis.

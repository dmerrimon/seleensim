Sleep Problems and Cancer:  The vast majority of cancer survivors, up to 90%, report some form of sleep quality 
impairment (SQI) post-treatment , such as excessive daytime napp ing, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, 
and waking up too early.1-[ADDRESS_773787] prevalent and distressing problems 
reported by [CONTACT_587647].1-11  Cancer survivors also demonstrate 
dysregulated circadian activity rhythms, impaired physical func tion (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and 
chronically up-regulated inflammatory responses when their slee p is compromised. 4,5,12-[ADDRESS_773788]. Roscoe and investigator s in our URCC NCORP Research Base  
shows that 80% of cancer survivors recruited for this study report 
experiencing persistent insomnia  during the first 5 years after  
completion of surgery, chemothera py and/or radiation therapy.51-
[ADDRESS_773789]. Roscoe and colleagues also suggests that cognitiv e 
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective for treating persistent insomnia (p < 0.05) among these 
survivors and that the number of  years since completing primary  treatments for cancer has no impact on the 
efficacy of CBT-I (p> 0.05).51-53  Formally intervening with a b ehavioral treatment for insomnia  was both necessary 
and helpful for cancer survivors regardless of number of years since completion of primary cancer treatments.51-53  
This is supported by [CONTACT_587648].3,50,54,55  Finally, we note that the NCCN guidelines for cancer survivor s specifically recommend formally 
intervening among cancer survivors to alleviate insomnia with n o designated cut-off in terms of years since completion of 
treatment.56   
 
Treatment options for insomnia include: 1) pharmaceuticals, whi ch do not cure insomnia and can lead to toxicities, 
negative interactions with cancer therapeutics, dependency, and  rebound impairment after di scontinuation, 2) traditional 
exercise, which is recommended in treatment guidelines, but not  widely implemented in survivorship care plans beyond 
the use of generalized statements in which survivors are encour aged to be physically active and exercise, and 3) 
psychobehavioral interventions.1-10  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the gold  standard 
psychobehavioral treatment for i nsomnia for the general population, and it is efficacious for treating insomnia among 
cancer survivors.57,[ADDRESS_773790] that yoga may improve insomnia and SQI by 
[CONTACT_587649], improving physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and decreasing inflammation.
14,59-73  We conducted—to our knowledge—t he first multicenter, phase II I, randomized, 
controlled trial (RCT), in 410 cancer survivors from 12 community oncology practices throug hout the U.S., showing that Figure 1: Number of Survivors Reporting

[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 6 of 43  our standardized yoga intervention (YOCAS©®: 4 wks., 2x/wk., 75 min./session)  produced significant moderat e to large 
improvements in insomnia and SQ I while also improving circadian  activity rhythms.  Yoga par ticipants decreased sleep 
medication use, while control par ticipants increased sleep medi cation use.  Adherence to YOCAS©® was relatively high at 
80%, and there were no study-rela ted adverse events.  All (100% ) participants found the YOCAS©® program useful and 
would recommend it to other can cer survivors experiencing sleep  problems.   
 
In response to NCI research priorities and PA 11-260, we propos ed a follow-on study that aligns with NCI research 
priorities to develop effective supportive care interventions f or survivors.  We proposed a multicenter, 3-arm, blinded, 
phase III RCT to fill remaining empi[INVESTIGATOR_587605] 1) our standard YOCAS©® 
program, ARM 2) standard CBT-I, and ARM 3) a health education i ntervention controlling for time and attention for 
improving insomnia in 720 cancer survivors 2-60 months followin g adjuvant treatment. We will also explore three 
possible mechanisms through which YOCAS©® may improve insomnia—circadia n activity rhythms, physical func tion 
(i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and inflammatory immune responses—based on our biobehavioral model.  
 Innovation:  This study is innovative becau se it is the first multi-center, phase III, blinded, RCT to test: 1) the 
effectiveness of YOCAS©® compared to CBT-I and a health education control for improving insomnia and SQI, 2) the 3- 
and 6-month sustainability of insomnia benefits from YOCAS©®, and 3) the role of possible functional and biological 
mediators in the efficacy of YOCAS©®.  CBT-I is an effective gold standard treatment for the genera l population—this 
trial will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_587606] S©® should be considered a gold standard treatment option

hour circadian activity rhythms us ing a multi-oscillating model , physical function, cytokines, yoga and sleep in cancer 
survivors.  We are not aware of any other group doing this work .

2.0  Background 
________________ 
 
If YOCAS©® is shown to be as effective as or more effective than CBT-I an d more effective than health education and if 
insomnia improvements are sustained 3 and 6 months later from t he yoga intervention, the benefits for cancer survivors 
would include: 1) an additional evidence-based, safe, non-pharmacological, effective, low-cost, enjoyable treatment for 
insomnia—possibly a new gold standard treatment option; 2) a st andardized yoga therapy that can be explicitly prescribed 
and reproducibly disseminated in communities as part of survivo rship care plans for the treatment of insomnia; and 3) a 
better understanding of the functi onal and biological pathways through which YOCAS©® works to improve insomnia in 
order to further refine its effective use and applicability in various cancer populations.   
 Yoga—A Holistic Mind-Body Mode of Exercise:   The many different styles and types of yoga are based on Eastern 
traditions from India (e.g., Classical, Advaita Vedanta, Tantra ), Tibet (e.g., Tibetan), and China (e.g., Chi Kung, Tai 
Chi).61,74,[ADDRESS_773792] yoga is derived from its Sanskrit root “yuj,” which literally means “to yoke” or join together.  In this 
case, yoga refers to joining the mind and the body.61,74,[ADDRESS_773793] forms of yoga were firmly rooted in physical and  
mindful (breathing and meditative) practices and led to what is  known today as classical yoga which forms the basis for 
most of the yoga currently taught in the U.S.74   
 
Yoga, Sleep Quality Impairment and Insomnia:  The existing evidence suggests that yoga is effective for imp roving 
SQI, but we were unable to find published studies that specific ally addressed the effects of yoga on insomnia in cancer 
survivors.  In addition, no studies in cancer compared the effe cts of yoga on SQI to a proven effective gold-standard 
treatment for insomnia or SQI, examined the long-term durabilit y of effects, or examined potential mechanisms of action 
through which yoga may improve insomnia or SQI.14,59-61,64,65,71,73,76  
 Yoga Program Evaluations:  Four evaluations of community yoga programs for cancer patients and survivors 
suggest that yoga may improve SQI.62,63,69,[ADDRESS_773794] and will use our standardized yoga intervention, YOCAS©®.   
 
Phase I and II Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4287]:  One phase I and five phase II studies provide preliminary support for the safety, 
feasibility and efficacy of yoga f or improving SQI among cancer  patients and survivors (See Table 1).59,61,71,73,76  
These studies assessed a range of yoga doses from 1-2 sessions/week with classes lasting 50-120 minutes using a variety 
of different types of yoga over 4-12 weeks.  The interventions included a variety of postures and mindfulness exercises.  The interventions were deemed saf e and feasible for cancer patients receiving treatment and survivors.  Participants 
enjoyed the yoga interventions and in four studies reported imp rovements in SQI; two studies showed no changes in 
SQI.
60,[ADDRESS_773795] that yoga may be more effective for 
improving SQI than counseling, hea lth education, time and atten tion. Using YOCAS©® we conducted the first—to our 
knowledge--phase III RCT demonstrating the efficacy of yoga for  improving insomnia, SQI, and circadian activity 
rhythms among 410 cancer survivors. [See preliminary study 1.]  This follow-on study compares the efficacy of 
YOCAS©® to CBT-I and a health education control, examines the durabili ty of insomnia benefits, and explores 
possible mechanisms (circadian, physical and immune function).  This RCT compares yoga to a health education control for time and attention.

[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 8 of 43  Patients,” “Yoga for Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors,” and  “Healing Yoga”), there is little, if any, evidence as to the 
efficacy of these programs for im proving insomnia or SQI among cancer survivors. These yoga programs are not 
regulated, and there is significant variability in what is offered.  For example, some yoga programs focus on very gentle, 
low-intensity, meditative practic es (e.g., Restorative, Integral, Svaroopa), while others focus on vigorous practices (e.g., 
Power, Ashtanga), and yet others focus on both (e.g., Hatha, Iy engar, Kundalini).77  Some programs modify the yoga 
environment by [CONTACT_587650] (e.g., Bikram) or props such as straps, blocks, ropes and chairs (e.g., 
Iyengar).77  Class structure varies considerably; some classes include only physical postures and no mindfulness exercises, 
while others include only mindf ulness exercises and no physical  postures.  The small number of studies examining the 
safety and effectiveness of only limited types of yoga for impr oving SQI among survivors coupled with the lack of 
regulation and wide variabilit y of yoga course offerings substa ntially increases the chance that survivors may spend a 
sizeable amount of time, energy a nd money participating in yoga  programs that may not be safe or effective.  For 
example, yoga in a room heated  to over 100 degrees may be contr aindicated for some survivors, and vigorous yoga may 
result in excessive muscle sore ness and joint pain, increasing insomnia.  
 We developed Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS
©®) as a standardized program of yoga that can be easily and 
consistently replicated for res earch, and ultimately, dissemina tion and used in the treatment of insomnia and SQI.   
YOCAS©® is a standardized yoga program  designed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mustian and her  research team specifically for use by [CONTACT_587651].  The YOCAS©® program is a low to moderate intensity mode of exercise that d raws from two 
basic types of yoga: gentle Hat ha and Restorative yoga.  The pr ogram includes 16 specific physical postures (asanas) and 
mindfulness exercises focused on breathing (pranayama) and medi tation (dhyana).  The program is designed to be 
delivered by [CONTACT_587652], two times a week for 75 minutes over four 
weeks—an explicit yoga prescripti on for the treatment of insomn ia and SQI.  [See the detailed clinical protocol.]  We also 
developed a training program for yoga instructors, including a written manual and two DVDs.  The training materials 
provide precise instructions for all posture, breathing and med itation exercises with appropriate modifications if 
necessary.  We successfully trained 18 yoga instructors and used the YOCAS©® program in our first multicenter 
study.  We will train additional instructors and use YOCAS©® again in the current study.   
 
Limitations of Previous Phase I-III Studies:  None of the phase I-II studies was a definitive phase III RCT that was 
planned and powered a priori to test the effects of yoga on ins omnia or SQI as a primary outcome.  The sample sizes were 
small, ranging from 20-88.  They did not screen for or require a specific level of insomnia or SQI as part of participant 
eligibility.  The studies did not blind participants with the e xception of the Bower study.76  Yoga interventions were not 
standardized and were highly variable in content, type, intensi ty, and duration of yoga, making it impossible to determine 
the actual dose of yoga needed to improve insomnia or SQI.  The  yoga interventions were not described in great detail, 
making repeatability and standardized dissemination impossible.  While general comments suggested the interventions 
were safe and that participants enjoyed them, no specific detai ls were provided on the rate of adverse events.  Information 
on participant attendance, compliance and attrition, details of the prescribed yoga dose vers us the actual dose achieved 
(e.g., mode, frequency, intensity , duration), and information on sustainability of improvements in SQI stemming from 
yoga were limited.  Furthermore, no studies, including our prev ious phase III trial, compare d yoga to a gold-standard 
treatment for insomnia or SQI such as CBT-I—a required next ste p in clinical research if yoga i s to be determined a gold-
standard treatment option for insomnia.   Moreover, no studies,  with the exception of ours, examined possible biological 
mechanisms through which yoga may improve insomnia or SQI.  This phase III RCT capi[INVESTIGATOR_587607], 
comparing YOCAS©® to CBT-I and a health education time and attention control, examining the durability of 
effects on insomnia and investigating biological mechanisms whe reby [CONTACT_587653]©® may improve insomnia.   
 
Yoga Summary:  Further research is warranted b ecause, despi[INVESTIGATOR_406238], these phase I-III studies collectively 
suggest that: 1) cancer patients can safely participate in yoga  during and after cancer treatment s, 2) yoga interventions are 
feasible in a variety of cance r centers and community-based yog a studios, 3) cancer survivors participating in these yoga 
programs enjoy them and find them beneficial, and 4) yoga parti cipation ranging from 1-2 sessions/week for 50-120 
minutes per session over a period of 4-12 weeks may lead to imp rovements in insomnia and SQI.   
 
Pathophysiology of Insomnia and SQI:  The pathophysiology of insomnia and SQI and their relationships  with cancer 
and its treatments are largely unexplained.25,48,78  Research suggests that sleep p roblems may arise through multi ple 
pathophysiologic pathways incl uding dysregulated hypothalamic-p ituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) function stemming 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 9 of 43  from abnormal sleep/wake homeostasis, hyperarousal, disruptive cognitive and behavioral factors and impaired circadian, 
physical (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular) and immune function.  [Note: We acknowledge our model does not include ALL potential biopsychosocial mechanisms (e.g., relaxation pathways); it’s not possible to  investigate them ALL in a 
single clinical trial.]  Our working model is based on our rese arch and that of others showing that cancer survivors with 
compromised sleep demonstrate dysregulated circadian function ( i.e., flattened diurnal rhythms, suppressed morning 
peaks, elevated evening nadirs, and delayed acrophases), impaired physical function (decreased cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and dysregulated immune responses (chronical ly up-regulated pro-inflammatory responses).
4,5,12-2425-[ADDRESS_773804] effects of yoga on circadian activity rhythms, physical 
function (i.e., cardiopulmonary [6-minute walk] and muscular [s trength]) and inflammatory responses, as well as, the 
mediating effects of these plausible mechanisms on insomnia.     
 
Integrated Behavioral and Biological Systems Model (See Figure 2):   Our theory is that cancer and its treatments 
directly and negatively influence circadian, physical (i.e., ca rdiopulmonary and muscular) and immune function; 
in turn, diminished function in these systems leads to insomnia.  Cancer and its treatments also lead to a reduction 
in physical activity/exercise th at elicits physical decondition ing responses which, in turn, lead to diminished 
function in these same systems, further impairing sleep.  Yoga, a form of exercise, is capable of positively 
influencing each of these systems and improving circadian, phys ical and immune function and, consequently, 
improving insomnia as described below.    
Yoga and The Circadian Clock System:   Yoga is a form of exercise that may regulate circadian function  by [CONTACT_587654]-photosensitizer for the circadian system that normalizes dysregulated circadian 
activity rhythms stemming from cancer and its treatments, there by [CONTACT_587655].  The circadian clock 
system consists of a central com ponent—the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus known as the body’s 
“master clock”—and peripheral co mponents involving multiple organ- and tissue-specific “clocks.”  These peripheral 
clocks are synchronized through humoral and neural connections throughout the body that, in turn, affect behavioral and 
physiological output rhythms (i .e., diurnal fluctuations in sle ep, physical activity, heart ra te, strength, and cytokines).79-81  
Figure 2: Integrated Systems Biological Model 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 10 of 43  The master clock, however, has its own intrinsic rhythm which is entrained—synchronized to a 24-hour cycle--by 
[CONTACT_587656]- and non-photosensitizers. The strongest photos ensitizer is light; one of the strongest non-
photosensitizers is exercise (e.g., yoga).81  Our prior study suggests that  yoga favorably alters circadian  activity rhythms.14  
We will assess circadian activity  rhythms using actigraphy as in preliminary study 1 described below.    
 Yoga and The Immune System— Inflammatory Responses:  Yoga may regulate immune function in the same way 
as other modes of exercise, by [CONTACT_587657]-regulated pro-inflammatory responses exhibited in 
cancer survivors as a result of their disease and its treatment s; this dampening, in turn, may normalize overall 
inflammatory responses and improve insomnia.  Exercise reduces low-grade infla mmation by [CONTACT_587658]-6.82  IL-6 is released from skeletal m uscle in proportion to exercise intensity and duration; the 
proportion of muscle mass used during an exercise bout, and tra ining status.82  In this environment IL-6 functions as an 
anti-inflammatory molecule by [CONTACT_587659] , IL-10, and IL-1r  which, c onsequently, inhibits the 
production of TNFα, IL-8, IL-1  and IFNg and regulates overall inflammatory responses.82  Research suggests that yoga 
may improve inflammatory immune responses in cancer survivors w ith SQI.66,67,72  We will assess inflammation with 
appropriate standardized high-sensitivity multiplexed cytokine/ chemokine assay kits under GLP compliance as in  
preliminary studies 2 through 5 below.   
 
Yoga and Physical Function in the Cardiopulmonary and Muscular Systems:  Yoga may improve physical function 
(i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) in the same way a s other modes of exercise, by [CONTACT_829] a 
physiological conditioning response.  This physical conditionin g response may improve the reduced physical 
function exhibited by [CONTACT_587660] a result of their dis ease and its treatment, consequently improving 
insomnia.  It is well documented that trad itional modes of exercise performed frequently at high enough intensities for a 
sufficient duration improve cardiopulmonary and muscular function as part of a desirable physical conditioning 
response,83,84 and that regular exercise, using traditional modes, which impr oves physical function (cardiopulmonary and 
muscular), results in medium to large improvements in total sle ep time, slow wave or “deep” sleep, nighttime 
wakefulness, sleep onset latency and insufficient sleep.85-[ADDRESS_773805]. Mustian’s preliminary studies 2 through 5.

single-oscillator, 24-hour model a nd demonstrated significant r hythm differences between  groups post-intervention 
(p<0.05) with a delayed 12-hour acrophase in the yoga group (p< 0.05).  The yoga group demons trated higher physical 
activity during the morning (first 12 hours of the day) and sta bilized physical activity throughout the afternoon and 
evening (second 12 hours of the day); whereas, the standard car e control group showed a lower physical activity pattern in 
the morning and a higher peak in physical activity in the after noon and evening.  Blunted morning circadian rhythms (low 
physical activity) and excessive  peaks (high physical activity)  in circadian rhythms during the afternoon and evening are 
associated with SQI.

Adherence and Adverse Events:  Survivors assigned to the yoga arm attended an average of 6.5 of the 8 prescribed 
sessions for a total of 480 minutes of the prescribed 600 minut es during the 4-week intervention period.  Survivors in the 
yoga arm also reported extra yoga  practice outside of the two r equired yoga sessions, resulting in a total average of 182 
minutes each week over 3 days with a rating of perceived exerti on of 3.4 (moderate intensity).  Contamination in the 
control condition was very low; 7 participants reported an aver age of 20 minutes of yoga one time each week with a rating 
of perceived exertion of 1.0 (very weak) during the interventio n period.  There were no study-related adverse events.  
Survivors liked the yoga intervention; 100% found it useful for improving their sleep and would recommend it to other 
cancer survivors.   
 Yoga Intervention:  We used the YOCAS
©® program previously described in the background section and fully detailed in 
the manual.  To ensure intervention quality, fidelity across st udy sites and instructors, and to prevent drift over the course  
of the study, [CONTACT_142003] and her team developed a specialized training program for instructors that included a set of two 
DVDs, a written manual, and a 2-hour web-based teleconference training workshop.  Training updates were provided on a 
regular basis—minimally every s ix months.  An independent and r andom observation of class instruction was also made 
during each 4-week YOCAS©® intervention by [CONTACT_587661].   
 Measures:  Measures included: SQI  and Sleep Medication Use (Pi [INVESTIGATOR_2272]; PSQI),
94 Insomnia 
(Insomnia Severity Index; ISI).95,96  Wake after sleep onset, sleep e fficiency and circadian activi ty rhythms were assessed

Changes in Physical Function and Inflammation Are Possible Mech anisms Whereby [CONTACT_587663]—Studies 2 through 4:    
 
Study 2:  [CONTACT_142003] and her team conducted a phase II RCT comparing t he influence of a Tai Chi Chuan (a Chinese 
form of yoga) intervention (3x/week, 60 minutes/session, 12 wee ks) on physical function and inflammation to a 
psychosocial support therapy intervention among breast cancer survivors (N=21) between [ADDRESS_773809]-
adjuvant therapy.  Results showed better cardiopulmonary function (6-minute walk test) and muscular function 
(handgrip test) as well as more favorable inflammatory responses in the tai chi group compared to the support therapy group post intervention.  Participants liked the intervention and attended 72% of the sessions with no 
adverse events.
36,38,41-43,45,47 
 Study 3:  [CONTACT_142003] and her research t eam also conducted a phase II R CT examining the influence of a low to moderate 
intensity aerobic and resistance exercise intervention (Exercis e for Cancer Patients—EXCAP©®) on SQI, physical 
function (i.e., cardiopulmonary function and muscular function)  and inflammatory responses among breast and prostate 
cancer patients (N=38) beginning  radiation therapy.  Participan ts were randomized to 4 weeks of exercise or no exercise.  
Cytokines and receptors were measured using appropriate ELISAs.   Exercise participants exhibited less SQI, better 
physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary function via 6-minute walk test and muscular function via handgrip 
dynamometer test) and reduced i nflammatory responses post intervention compared to participants in the control 
group.  Higher levels of IL-6 and lower levels of TNFR1 were as sociated with increased SQI.35,46   
 
Study 4:  We also recently completed a phase II RCT examining the influen ce of the EXCAP©® intervention over 6 
weeks on SQI and physical func tion (cardiopulmonary and muscula r function) in 53 prostate cancer patients.  EXCAP©® 
participants demonstrated improve ments in cardiopulmonary funct ion (VO 2max) and strength (repetition 
maximal testing), and these improvements were inversely correla ted with SQI (all p<0.05).  These changes in 
cardiopulmonary and muscular func tion significantly predicted c hanges in SQI (p<0.05, r=0.120) and, collectively, 
accounted for approximately 17% of the variance in SQI.

Severity Index) [ADDRESS_773812] intervention compared to a health education control. 
 
3.3 Exploratory Aims:  
 1. To explore whether YOCAS
©® is effective for improving circadian activity rhythms (24 and 12 hour 
amplitudes and acrophases measured via actigraphy), physical fu nction (i.e., cardiopulmonary [6-min. walk] 
and muscular function [dynamometry]), and inflammation (IL-6, I L-8, IL-10, IL-1 , IFN- , & TNFR1 via 
standardized ELISAs) compared to CBT-I and a health education c ontrol.  
 
2. To explore whether changes in c ircadian activity rhythms, physical function and inflammation mediate the 
effect of YOCAS©® on insomnia.   
 3. To explore the time-varying nature of physical activity behavior after cancer treatment and develop a new methodological approach to jointly model longitudinally measured exposures and outcomes subject to measurement error and modification by [CONTACT_587664] a physical activity intervention study.

6.0  Research Protocol 
_________________________ 
 
6.1 Overview and Intervention Groups:   [ADDRESS_773824]-primary (i.e., surgery,  
chemotherapy, and/or radiation) t reatment will be randomized to  YOCAS, CBT-I, or the Health Education group.   
 6.2 Blinding:   As part of the consenting pr ocess, participants will be blinded to study hypotheses and the true nature 
of the health education control condition (which is not expecte d in any way to improve insomnia; it is there to 
provide a time and attention c ontrol condition for the yoga arm ).  In the beginning of the study they will be told 
that we are comparing three different interventions for improving sleep, specifically insomnia.  Participants will 
be fully briefed about the nature of the study, the hypotheses we tested, and the true nature of the health education 
control condition upon completing the study during the exit int erview. 
 6.3 YOCAS
©® Group:  This is the standardized YOCAS©® yoga intervention which is a low to moderate intensity 
mode of exercise that draws from two basic types of yoga; gentl e Hatha and Restorative yoga.  The program 
includes 18 specific physical postures and mindfulness exercises focused on breathing and meditation.  Instructors will be allowed to modify the yoga  postures to meet the specifi c needs of participants and participants will be 
allowed to use yoga props.  (See the YOCAS
©® manual, “Yoga for Cancer Survi vors”.)  The program is delivered 
by [CONTACT_587668]/or International Association of  Yoga Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (IAYT) instructors in 
community settings, 2 times a week for 75-minute sessions over 4 weeks.  Yoga instructor qualifications are 
documented in a resume or CV and submitted to the Research Base  along with a copy of their Yoga Alliance 
and/or International Association of Yoga Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (IAYT) cred entials for approval. 
 6.4 CBT-I Group:   This is standard Cognitive Behav ioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).  CBT-I is a standardized 
structured, multi-component cogniti ve behavioral intervention ( sleep education, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, 
stimulus control, cognitive thera py, and relapse prevention).  (See the CBT-I workbook, “Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy for Insomnia”.)  CBT-I is delivered by [CONTACT_587669] (e.g., clinical psychologists, 
licensed clinical social workers, licensed counselors, nurses, etc.) to deliver CBT.  The intervention is delivered 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 18 of 43  once a week for 90 minutes over an 8 week period.  CBT-I instru ctor qualifications are documented in a resume 
or CV and submitted to the Research Base for approval. 
 
6.5 Health Education Control Group:   This group will receive a survi vorship health education inter vention (equally 
matched to YOCAS©® for time and attention) which is based on the American Society  of Clinical Oncology 
cancer survivorship educational recommendations and a booklet e ntitled “Cancer Survivorship Next Steps for 
Patients and Their Families.”  (See the health education bookle t.)  The intervention is delivered by [CONTACT_587670] a minimum o f a Bachelor’s degree in a hea lth-related field or Registered Nurse certification, 
and a year of experience working in a clinical oncology setting with patients.  This intervention is delivered 2 times a week for 75 minutes per session over 4 weeks.  Health professional qualifications  are documented in a 
resume or CV and submitted to the Research Base for approval. 
 6.6 The participants will all participate in the treatment they  are assigned together as a group (1 group for each study 
arm condition) and the treatment sessions will only contain study participants.  Participants will not be charged for any of the treatment sessions.

We will use this same training program to train the CBT-I instructors for this study.  [CONTACT_142003] and her team also developed a training program for health educators, includi ng a manual and PowerPoint presentation.  The 
training materials provide precise instructions on the content to be covered in each of the health education sessions.  We will use this program to train the health educati on instructors for this study.  Each study instructor 
must successfully complete all training sessions prior to final  approval to serve as an instructor in this study.  
Training sessions take approximately [ADDRESS_773826]. Mustian and her team.   
 6.8 Intervention Quality:   The exact same procedures used to ensure quality and fidelity  and to prevent drift that 
were used in the previous yoga study, U3905, will be used in th is trial, except we will use videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_587614].  The  interventions will be de livered by [CONTACT_587674]. Mustian and membe rs of the research team.  All instructors will

at all times.  Coordinators will be required to videotape the t hird class in each condition and send the videotape to 
the URCC NCORP Research Base by  [CONTACT_587675] y.  Tapes will be reviewed within [ADDRESS_773827]. M ustian.  Immediate feedback will be provided to the 
instructor and NCORP site staff so that corrections can be made  if necessary.  If at any time a coordinator or staff 
member realizes the intervention protocols are not being follow ed properly, the Research Base and study P.I. ([CONTACT_587707]) must be notified immediately.  Video recordings will be uploaded via the  research base’s secure  
encrypted Box data upload system.  Once URCC has reviewed the v ideo recordings and given authorization, the 
sites must destroy them. 
 
6.8.1 Assessment Data Quality:  The coordinators must submit al l baseline data from one individual in each of 
the three arms by [CONTACT_941] 3rd work day post baseline.  This includes paperwork, fitness asse ssments, and 
actigraphy.  Data are either uploaded or emailed to URCC.  The Research Base will review and give the 
sites feedback so that corrections can be made if necessary.  O nce the site has downloaded the actigraph 
data they must immediately give  the actigraphs back to the appr opriate participants so they have them

the Research Base.  At screening, the DSM-V and ISI screening f orms will be used to determine eligibility for the 
study.   All persons presented with this study will be entered on a RE DCap screening log found on the 
Research Base website.  
6.12 Consent, Collection and Handling of Sensitive Data:  If the person meets all eligibility criteria, the coordinator 
will go over the study in detail using the full study consent form.  Both parties must sign the study consent form if 
the person agrees to be on study.  Participants are asked to pr ovide their medical insurance ID number and their 
social security number in the consent form to follow them as pa rt of future research in the Medicare and Medicaid 
Beneficiary databases and the URCC NCORP Research Base Distribu ted Research Network (DRN).  Information 
will not be obtained from individuals who do not give us permis sion to track them for future research in these 
databases.  Permission to follow a participant is voluntary.  T hey will be able to decline giving this information and 
still participate in the study.   
6.12.1  The URCC NCORP Research B ase DRN enables investigators to collaborate with each other in the use of 
electronic health data, while also safeguarding protected healt h information and proprietary data. It 
supports both single- and multisite research programs. The Netw ork’s querying capabilities reduce the 
need to share confidential or pr oprietary data by [CONTACT_587679] (i.e., data partners).  In some cases, queries can take the form of computer 
programs that a data partner can execute on a preexisting datas et.  The data partner can return the query 
result, typi[INVESTIGATOR_587615] (count) data, rather than the data  itself.  This form of remote querying reduces 
legal, regulatory, privacy, proprietary, and technical barriers  associated with data sharing for research.  
This form of querying also provides added protection for resear ch participants.   
The network seeks to build strong and trusted collaborations to support the research that will lead to 
improved health for millions of people around the world.   
6.12.[ADDRESS_773831] ed in a web-based; encrypted electronic REDCap YOCAS Insurance Information 
form created by [CONTACT_587680].  The REDCap system is  a secure, web-based application 
that is flexible enough and has an intuitive interface for users to enter data and real time validation rules 
(with automated data type and range checks) at the time of data  entry.  NCORP site study staff will meet 
with each participant in a pri vate and secure setting to fill o ut this form.  The staff member will confirm 
that the subject has consented to giving this information by [CONTACT_587681]. Only participants that c onsent to giving this informat ion will fill out a REDCap electronic 
Insurance Information form.  The  form must be completely filled  out during this session with the subject.  
The study staff will NOT be allowed to save this information in  any other form, whether paper or 
electronic, etc. to be uploaded later.  Once the form is comple te the sites will no longer have access to it.  
Each REDCap form has a unique ID# for tracking purposes. It wil l be sent directly to University of 
[COMPANY_002]ster’s server in a local d ata center. The database is secu red behind a firewall.  Only the PI, Lead 
coordinator of this study, URCC Research Base IT analyst, and the REDCap Administrator will have access to the database. There will also be limited access for t wo Research Base staff members who will be 
auditing this information.  Once all data for the study have be en collected, the file will be transferred to a 
URCC NCORP DRN secured database separate from the study databas e.  At this point only the data 
custodian (PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966]), th e Lead Coordinator, and Lead URC C IT staff member will have access to it.

Privacy officer and Security official. They may be required to complete follow-up information regarding 
exactly what the breach was and what steps were taken to prevent further breaches.  A breach of privacy 
must be reported to the University of [COMPANY_002]ster IRB as well as the NCORP site’s IRB.  
6.12.6    The disclosure of social security numbers, Medicaid a nd Medicare and Insurance ID numbers by [CONTACT_587683].  Potential participants can still take pa rt in this study if they decide not to disclose 
this information. 
6.13 Procedure Overview:   Participants in all three groups  will complete a battery of a ssessments including 
questionnaires, a weekly diary, a [ADDRESS_773833], actigraphy monitoring, and a 
fasting blood draw.  Within the i nformed consent process, the c oordinator or other study personnel will explain to 
the participants that there will be five assessment periods.  These assessments are completed at: 1) baseline, 2) mid-intervention, 3) post-interventi on, 4) [ADDRESS_773834]-inte rvention, and 5) [ADDRESS_773835]-intervention.  
Reminder phone calls will be made to participants regarding stu dy appointments, wearing the actigraphs, and 
completing questionnaires.  Permission will be obtained to leav e messages; however, coordinators must make every 
effort to speak with the study participant for these calls to b e considered complete.  Documentation of permission to 
leave a message should be record ed in coordinator notes.  Speci al arrangements are made to retrieve study materials 
via courier on a case by [CONTACT_587684]. 
Each assessment will include 1)  questionnaires on sleep (ISI, P SQI, MEQ-SA), mood (POMS), anxiety (STAI), 
depression (CES-D), pain (BPI [INVESTIGATOR_587616]), fatigue (MFSI, BFI, FAC IT-F ), cognitive problems (FACIT-COG), 
exercise (Godin), symptoms (Symptom Inventory), sleep medicatio ns and stimulant use (medication and CAM Use 
forms), and quality of life (FACIT), 2) a daily diary for asses sing sleep patterns and specific symptoms, 3) one 
week of actigraphy 4) physical f unction tests (6-minute walk an d handgrip tests), 5) and a fasting blood draw.  The 
actigraphs are small, water-resistant devices; one is worn around the wrist for [ADDRESS_773836] for the same 7 consecutive days to determine physical 
activity.  Participants will complete their questionnaires at t he time of their assessments or at home.   
 6.14 Requesting Actigraphs, Blood Draw Kits and Other Study Material s:  Study initiation materials will be 
shipped to the NCORP after the entire cohort is registered. The se materials are comprised of 1) the coordinator’s kit 
(including equipment for conducting the 6-minute walk test and handgrip test), 2) the video recorder, 3) actigraphs, 
4) yoga kits, and 5) blood suppli es.  The study supplies will b e shipped from the Research Base via FedEx for 
delivery within 2-3 business days.   
 6.15  Baseline Assessments:   Baseline assessments will occur on Study Days -[ADDRESS_773837] completed the URCC YOCA S©® study actigraphy training can instruct 
participants on how to wear them and give them to participants.     
 All participants will be asked t o complete on study data and cl inical information forms as well as a series of 
questionnaires to evaluate insomn ia, their emotional state, and  their physical health.  The questionnaires will take 
 
 
[ADDRESS_773838] will be conducte d to measure strength, and a fasting (minimum of 
8 hours) blood draw of approximately [ADDRESS_773839] completed the URCC Research Base training on 
functional assessment and blood dra w and processing are allowed to perform these assessments and process the 
blood specimens.   
 
6.16  Intervention:   Participants will begin the intervention immediately after ba seline assessments are complete.  
Participant adherence will be monitored by [CONTACT_587685], daily diaries, and actigraphy.   
 
6.16.1 Participants in the YOCAS©® and health education groups will pa rtake in the intervention t wice a week 
for 75 minutes over a 4 week period (study days 0-27 or study w eeks 2-5).   
6.16.2 Participants in the CBT-I group will complete one sessio n a week for 90 minutes over an 8 week period 
(study days 0-55 or study weeks 2-9).   
 
6.17 Mid-Point Assessment: Half-way through the intervention, participants will again complete study questionnaires 
(as detailed in section 6.13 above) as well as the [ADDRESS_773840] ing in their daily diaries.  The coordinator  will 
call and remind the participants  to wear their actigraphs for 7 consecutive days, to contin ue filling out their daily 
diaries, and to complete all study assessments.   
 
6.17.1 For participants in the YOCAS©® and health education groups, t he mid-point assessment will be done 
during study days 7-[ADDRESS_773841]-Intervention:  At the end of the intervention period, participants will comple te all study procedures as 
outlined above and stop entering data in their daily diaries af ter this assessment.  The coordinator will call 
participants and remind them to wear the actigraphs, complete forms and diaries, and to complete all study 
assessments.   
 
6.18.1 For participants in the YOCAS©® and health education groups, t he post assessment will be done during 
study days 21-[ADDRESS_773842] Intervention Follow Up:   At this assessment, participants will again be asked to fill out 
questionnaires, complete a [ADDRESS_773843], a  fasting blood draw, 7 consecutive days wearing 
the actigraphs, and filling out daily diaries for that time.  T he coordinator will complete a scheduling and 
reminder call during the week prior to the follow-up visit.   
 
6.19.1  For participants in the YOCAS©® and health education groups, t he 3-month post assessment will be done 
during study week 17. 
6.19.[ADDRESS_773844] Intervention Follow Up:   At this assessment, participants will again be asked to fill out 
questionnaires, complete a [ADDRESS_773845]-intervention assessment period.  All 
participants will be debriefed a nd the 3 study arms will be explained.  The coordinator co mpletes a scheduling and 
reminder call during the week prior to the follow-up visit.   
 
6.20.1  For participants in the YOCAS©® and health education groups, t he 6-month post assessment will be given 
during study week 29. 
6.20.[ADDRESS_773846] assessmen t will be given during study week 33. 
 
6.21 Management of actigraphy:   Actigraphy will be handled by [CONTACT_587686]. 
 
6.21.[ADDRESS_773847] be able to start wearing them when  they get up on the morning of Study Day 
-7 (Sunday morning).  Participants will wear a wrist actigraph 24 hours a day for 7 consecutive days, and 
a second actigraph will be worn around the participant’s waist [ADDRESS_773848] the participant when to re move the actigraphs (the following Sunday). 
Both will be worn during the baseline assessment, the mid-point  assessment, the post-intervention 
assessment, the 3-month post intervention follow -up, and the 6- month post intervention follow up.  As the 
actigraphs are water resistant but not waterproof, participants  will take the actigra phs off only when they 
shower, bathe, swim or do anything where the actigraphs would b e submerged in water. Otherwise, they 
should wear them as described above during each assessment peri od.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  NCORP research staff w ill explain to participants the  procedures for wearing the actigraphs and 
reinforce the importance of wearing them through the night.     
 [IP_ADDRESS]  All study participants  will keep both actigraphs from  baseline throughout study week 5 (this is 
the post-intervention assessment period for yoga and health edu cation groups, and mid-point 
for CBT-I group).   All actigraphs will then need to be retriev ed from participants during study 
week 6.  All data needs to be dow nloaded and sent to URCC.  DO NOT RE-INITIALIZE ANY 
ACTIGRAPHS UNTIL CONFIRMATION IS RECEIVED THAT URCC HAS THE DATA.  Once it is confirmed the data has been properly downloaded the actigraphs can be reinitialized.   
 
  The coordinator will need to make arrangements within [ADDRESS_773849] -intervention assessments 
during study week 9.   
 
The coordinator will need to re-initialize and return the actigraphs to participants in all three 
study groups for both the 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments.  Actigraphs need to be 
sent to participants during the week prior to the scheduled 3- and 6-month follow-ups.   
 
When not wearing the actigraphs, participants are instructed to plug them into the wall chargers and keep them charging.  Every a ttempt will be made to send the  same actigraphs to 
participants for all assessments.   
   
[IP_ADDRESS]  The NCORP research staf f will download the data from the actigraphs within 3-[ADDRESS_773850]-in tervention and the 2 follow-up assessments.  This will be 
determined on a case by [CONTACT_413].   
 
6.21.4 Assessment Training and Adherence to Assessment Protocols:    The University of [COMPANY_002]ster PEAK 
Human Performance Laboratory, a URMC CTSI Clinical Research Cor e Lab, provides services to aid 
investigators in effectively impl ementing behavioral interventi ons and assessing clinical outcomes that 
involve physical activity and function.  The PEAK Lab has been instrumental in standardizing the 
procedures for the collection of actigraphy, handgrip, and 6-mi nute walk data to ensure adherence to 
protocol.  The staff is also adep t at training NCORP site staff  to properly collect, process, store and ship 
blood for NCORP studies.  Study Chair, [CONTACT_587708], directs the PEAK Lab which has been 
closely involved in URCC Research  Base studies since its incept ion.  PEAK Lab staff have designed 
support materials and trained NC ORP site staff to administer th e behavioral interventions and outcome 
assessments for the URCC studies involving yoga (U3905), EXCAP intervention (UCCO08106) and many other URCC Research Base studies.  The PEAK lab staff are adept at managing and analyzing 
actigraph data and all functiona l data for NCORP Research Base studies as well as biological samples.   
  The URCC also requires each NCORP staff member to go through t raining programs which includes, 
overall protocol information, f unctional and clinical assessmen ts, actigraphy, blood collection and 
processing, videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], proper forms completion, and quality c ontrol checks.  Refresher training will be 
provided as needed. 
  Adherence will be monitored throughout the study as the inform ation is received at the URCC.  We have 
specifically implemented an extra quality assurance check after baseline, as well as having the NCORPs videotape the 3
rd intervention class to monitor in structor adherence to the spec ific program they are to 
teach. 
 6.22 Participant Reimbursement:   Participants will receive a $50.00 reimbursement for their ti me and effort to 
complete each study assessment for a total reimbursement of $25 0.00.  Participants are only reimbursed for the 
study assessments they actually complete.  Each NCORP will be r esponsible for dispersing the reimbursements to 
study participants using methods appropriate for their sites.  Each NCORP will invoice the URCC Research Base 
monthly for reimbursement expenses.  URCC will only reimburse f or the cash value of $50.00 per assessment; no 
gift card or other fees will be reimbursed if NCORPs choose to use methods of reimbursement that incur extra fees in lieu of cash.  Send invoices to:  Christine Bryce, [ADDRESS_773851]., Box 420658, [COMPANY_002]ster, NY [ZIP_CODE]

7.0  Patient Reported and Functional Measures 
____________________________________________ 
 
7.1 The On Study Data/Participant Record  and Clinical Record Information  forms are used to record 
demographic and clinical infor mation.  Diagnostic, treatment an d other clinical information will be abstracted 
from the participant’s chart a nd recorded on these forms.  Thes e data will be used for descriptive purposes, to aid 
in participant monitoring, for m oderator analyses and for exploratory analyses. 
 7.2 The two Medication and CAM Usage forms will track the participant’s use of prescription and non- prescription 
sleep and stimulant medication, as well as any other sleep and stimulant aids used during each assessment 
conducted during the study.  These forms will also specifically  ask participants to report the use of any CAM 
modalities for any reason. 
 7.3 Insomnia and Sleep Assessments: 
 
7.3.1 Insomnia will be measured by [CONTACT_587687] a Severity Index (ISI), which is  a well-validated self-report 
measure of insomnia.98-[ADDRESS_773855] been established.98-100 Total score 
will be used.  
 
7.3.2 Sleep quality  will be assessed by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_243999] (PS QI),101,102 a commonly used, 
24-item psychometrically sound measure scored for both global s everity and subscale scores. The PSQI 
will assess sleep initiation and ma intenance problems and possi ble etiologic factors (e.g., pain, 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 27 of 43  nightmares, and hot flashes). Tot al score will be used. This me asure takes less than 5 minutes to 
complete.  
 
7.3.3 Number of hours of sleep and intended sleep period  will be calculated from the Daily Diary.  For each 
day of the study period when sleep is assessed, participants wi ll indicate time to bed at night and time 
arose in the morning.   
 
7.3.4 Sleep Chronotype  will be measured by [CONTACT_587688]-Eveningness Questionnaire Self-Assessment 
(MEQ-SA).[ADDRESS_773856]-worn actigraphy-based data logger, the Actigraph GT3X manufactured by [CONTACT_587689], Pensacola, FL.  The Actigraph G T3X features a variable epoch length that can 
be set, and has 16MB of non-volatile memory. “Non-volatile” mea ns that even if the battery, which can log [ADDRESS_773857].  The motion data will 
be analyzed using the ActiLife Analysis Software.  The program uses a validated sleep algorithm to provide an 
assessment of sleep by [CONTACT_587690] “in bed” and “out of bed ” portions of the day.  The software and algorithms 
calculate the percent of sleep during these two portions of the  day.  The actigraphy, in conjunction with the 
sleep/wake diaries, can be used t o approximate the timing of both daytime and nighttime sleep.  While daily sleep 
diaries are a common method used to examine patterns of sleep and wakefulness, we will in ternally validate the 
at-home monitoring by [CONTACT_587691]-up to the daily 
questionnaires.  This measurement strategy allows for an assess ment of sleep problems (sleep latency, WASO, 
sleep efficiency, daytime sleep) which is free from either subj ective or observer bias and requires minimal subject 
compliance, allows for the detection of periods of wakefulness as brief as [ADDRESS_773858] actigraphs used to objectively assess 
sleep described in section 7.4 will be used.  A two-oscillator cosinor model (12 and 24 hours) will be calculated 
using nonlinear regression methods on the log (activity counts).  This model was found to fit the data for cancer survivors (Study 3) better than a single-oscillator model.  Mesor (overall), Amplitude, and Acrophase for the 12- and 24-hour cycles will be calculated.   
 
7.6 Cardiopulmonary Function (aerobic capacity) will be assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Te st, which is a sub-
maximal measurement using a 6- minute walk protocol.  A recent s ystematic review has concluded that this 
method possesses excellent measureme nt properties, was better tolerated, and was more reflective of activities of 
daily living than any o ther walk test in use.[ADDRESS_773859] (walking back 
and forth) or a larger room that allows for a circular/square w alking pattern.  Upon completion of the test, the total 
distance walked (in feet), exercise heart rate (in beats per mi nute), and exercise rate of perceived exertion (using 
the ACSM revised rating of exertion scale) are recorded.  This test was easy to implement, and well received in a 
busy clinical setting in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_587618].  The total distance walked in six 
minutes can be used to estimate gross VO 2 (oxygen consumption).87  Gross VO 2 = Resting VO 2 + Exercise (or 
net) VO 2.  The formula used to estimate gross VO 2 is  
 
VO 2 (mL *kg-1 * min-1) = [0.1 mL *kg-1 * meter-1 * S (m * min-1)] + [1.8 mL * kg-1 * meter-1 * S (m * min-1) * G] 
+ 3.5 mL *kg-1 * min-1 
 
Where S is speed in meters per minute and G is the percent grad e expressed as a fraction. 87  
 
7.7 Muscular Function  (strength) will be assessed using The Handgrip Dynamometer Tes t, which is a grip strength 
test used to assess the maximal voluntary contraction generated  by [CONTACT_587692].  The test is administered with 
the participant standing in anatomical position, the elbow join t angle will be held cons tant at 180 degrees.  Trials 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 28 of 43  will be performed in an alterna ting bilateral sequence for a total of six attempts (three with each arm).  A fourth 
test will be performed if any of the values vary by >3 Kg.  The  average score of the three trials will be used for 
right and left limbs to calculate  static strength.  The surgica lly involved arm(s) for breast cancer participants will 
be noted for data analysis.[ADDRESS_773860] was also easy to implement and well received in the  clinic in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_587619].  
  
7.8 Because many symptoms including cancer-related fatigue (CRF), depression, anxiety, mood disruption, cognitive 
problems and impaired QOL are often present with insomnia, measures of CRF, depression, anxiety, mood, sleep and cognitive problems have been carefully selected to minimize  potential confounding and enable assessment of 
possible confounds between these concepts.   
 
7.8.1 General Symptomatology  will be measured with the Symptom Inventory (SI),  a list of [ADDRESS_773861] on 
an 11-point scale, anchored by 0 = “Not Present” and 10 = “As Bad as You Can Imagine.”  An additional eight questions assess the degree that the symptoms interfere w ith the participant’s quality of life, with     
0 = “Did not interfere” and 10 = “Interfered completely.”  Ten additional questions assess the degree to 
which the participant uses speci fic mind-body techniques to man age symptoms.  Medical oncologists at 
our Cancer Center use this measure as part of clinical care, and we have used it in numerous studies.  It will serve as a concurrent self-report measure of symptoms that  will be used in exploratory analyses.   
 
7.8.2 Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) will be assessed subjectively via the revised Brief Fatigue Inv entory 
(BFI),105,[ADDRESS_773862] used in previous studies.92  The BFI allows for the rapid assessment of fatigue level and its 
interference with daily activiti es in cancer patients, and identifies those patients with severe fatigue.  The 
reliability and validity of the BFI were demonstrated in a stud y of 305 cancer patients and 290 
community-dwelling adults.  An inte rnal consistency coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha) of 0.96 was 
demonstrated when the BFI was administered to 305 patients with  cancer.93  This measure was used in the 
previously mentioned pi[INVESTIGATOR_587620].   
 7.8.3 CRF  will also be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chron ic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Subscale 
(FACIT-F).   The FACIT-F subscale is a [ADDRESS_773863]/retest reliability as well as validity.94,[ADDRESS_773864] used this scale in our 
previous studies including the pi[INVESTIGATOR_587621].  
 7.8.4 In addition, CRF  will be assessed subjectively vi a the Multidimensional Fatigue  Symptom Inventory

7.8.5 Depressive Symptoms  will be measured with the  Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] 
(CES-D) .  The CES-D56 is a 20-item depression scale developed and validated for use with a variety of 
populations.  It is in a format similar to that of the Beck Dep ression Inventory, but with less emphasis on 
physical symptoms of depression that may be confounded with dis ease symptoms or treatment side 
effects.  It has been shown to r eliably and validly measure dep ression in cancer populations,[ADDRESS_773866] successfully used this measure in previous studies.   
 
7.8.6 Anxiety will be measured using the  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593]/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).  In order to reduce 
the overall patient burden, we will use only the state portion of the questionnaire.  This one-page, self-
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 29 of 43  administered questionnaire consists of 20 short statements whic h people may use to describe their 
feelings.  Participants are asked  to indicate the degree to whi ch they generally experience each particular 
feeling, ranging from 1 = “Not at all” to 4 = “Very much so” at that time.  It is one of the most widely-
used assessments of anxiety.  Int ernal consistency coefficients  > 0.[ADDRESS_773867]/retest reliability coeffici ents > 0.70.  Concurrent, const ruct, convergent and divergent validity have 
also been demonstrated.103,[ADDRESS_773868] successfully implemented this measure in previous stu dies.   
 
7.8.7 General Mood  will be assessed using the short form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS).  The POMS 
consists of 30 adjectives in 6  subscales (e.g., anxiety, depres sion), which subjects rate on a five-point 
scale with “1” = “Not at all” a nd “5” = “Extremely” to describe  their moods over the past week.  The 
POMS has been used extensively i n research with cancer patients  and has demonstrated reliability and 
validity.105,106 
 
7.8.8 Cognitive Problems  will be assessed using the Func tional Assessment of Chronic Il lness Therapy-
Cognitive Well-being Subscale (FACIT-Cog).[ADDRESS_773869]/retest reliability as well as 
validity.90,94,[ADDRESS_773870] used 
this instrument in our previous  studies (e.g., the pi[INVESTIGATOR_587622]). 
 
7.8.9 Quality of Life  (QOL) will be assessed subjectively via the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy (FACIT; FACT-F).  The FACIT; FACT-F is a 27-item QOL scale developed specifically for use 
in cancer clinical trials.90  It was developed by [CONTACT_587693] s experiencing symptoms of ca ncer, and it has been validated in a 
series of studies of 542 cancer patients.  The basic measure has shown very good tes t/retest reliability as 
well as validity.90,94,[ADDRESS_773871] used this instrument in our previous studies, including the pi[INVESTIGATOR_587623]. 
 
7.8.10 Pain will be assessed via the Brief Pai n Inventory (BPI) and the Vis ual Analog Scale (VAS) to evaluate 
the severity and quality of pain experienced.  The Brief Pain I nventory (BPI) has become one of the most 
widely used measurement tools for assessing clinical pain.109 The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_587624] h common dimensions of feeling and 
function. Initially developed to assess pain related to cancer,  the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_587625] a wide range of clinical conditions.  The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_587626]. In some ways, the BPI [CONTACT_832] a “legacy” instrument—a self- report measure that has, over time, 
become a standard for the asse ssment of pain and its impact.  The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a 
measurement instrument that measures joint pain across a contin uum of pi[INVESTIGATOR_587627] 
0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine).  The questi on associated with the VAS reads as 
follows:  ‘‘Please score the inten sity of the pain you feel in your peripheral joints (knee, wrist, 
fingers/toes, elbow, shoulder, etc .), excluding spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/back pain  and pain at the operated area.’’ 
 
7.9 Physical Exercise/Activity  will be assessed subjectively usi ng the Godin Leisure Time Exe rcise Questionnaire 
and a Daily Diary . 
 7.9.1 The amount of leisure time spent in physical activity wil l be assessed using the Godin Leisure Time 
Exercise Questionnaire (Godin).[ADDRESS_773872] 15 minutes during a participant’s free time.  The measure is ea sily administered and brief, with a retest 
coefficient of .62, a concurrent coefficient of .32 and an obje ctive validity coefficient of .56 compared 
with CALTRAC accelerometry, estimated VO
2 max and body composition (via hydrostatic weight).111  
The Godin has also been used successfully in populations of adu lt cancer patients.112-115

7.9.2 The Daily Diary is designed to track compliance and parti cipation in the exercise intervention and 
additional daily activities.  The participant will be asked to take 1-2 minutes and complete the journal 
each morning upon wakening and each evening immediately prior t o sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  This daily diary was used 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_587628], and participants completed the forms without any problems.   
 
7.9.3 A s an objective measure of physical  activity, a GT3X+ actigraph will be worn around the 
waist.  The GT3X+ actigraph provides calculated energy expenditure values for Active Energy 
Expenditure (AEE) in kilocalorie s and total energy expenditure in Metabolic Equivalents per 
Time (METs) in kilocalories/m in/kg.  The GT3X+ actigraph features a variable sample rate 
which can be set between non-volat ile memory. “Non-volatile” me ans that even if the battery,

7.10 Participant Feedback regarding their views on the experimental treatment they receiv ed will be assessed via 
completion of a feedback questionnaire by [CONTACT_587695]-ended qualitative inte rviews at the conclusion 
of the study.  The information in  the feedback questionnaire and interviews will allow us, for future studies, to 
obtain information needed to alter aspects of the interventions  with which participants were displeased and to 
determine participants’ reactions to the intervention.   
     
 
8.0  Blood Analysis  
     
 
8.1  Cytokines  (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1 , IFN- , & TNFr1) will be assessed in the blood at all five assessment  time 
points.  A fasting blood draw (minimum of 8 hours) will be perf ormed on all participants at all five assessment 
time points.  The standard URCC NCORP Research Base blood colle ction protocol will be used.  Six tubes of 
blood (approximately 50ml) will be collected including: two red top tubes for serum, two purple top EDTA-
heparin tubes (1 for plasma a nd 1 for DNA) and [ADDRESS_773874]. Mustian’s research team.  All NCORPs 
will handle all human biological materials and disposal of biohazard waste in accordance with biosafety level II guidelines at their respective institutions for blood collectio n, handling, disposal, sto rage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  All 
NCORP personnel handling human biological materials and laborat ories used by [CONTACT_587696] n guidelines according to their facility guidelines.   
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_773875] participate in the training provided by [CONTACT_587697], previ ously described in section 6.0, and be approved by [CONTACT_9154] (or 
PI’s designee) prior to any blood collection at each NCORP site .  
 
8.1.2  Serum will be extracted from the two red top tubes for e stimation of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1 , 
IFN-, & TNFr1).  Plasma will be extracted from one of the purple to p EDTA-heparin tubes for 
estimation of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1 , IFN- , & TNFr1).  To extract the serum and plasma, the 
tubes will first sit upright for 30 minutes at room temperature  after blood collection.  Second, the tubes 
will then be put into a centrif uge (note temp) and spun for 15 minutes at 1600 x g.  After 15 minutes, 
there should be a clear separation of the serum or plasma (yell owish liquid on top) from the other cells.  If 
this is not evident, then centrifuge for 15 additional minutes.   The upper layer of serum (red top tubes) 
and plasma (purple top tube) is then gently aliquotted into the  2.0 ml microfuge tubes provided in each 
URCC NCORP patient blood draw kit.  Serum from the red top bloo d tubes is to be placed into the pre-
labeled pi[INVESTIGATOR_587630].  Pla sma from the purple top tube is to be placed in the pre-labeled purple 
microfuge tubes.  All microfuge tubes are then placed in the pre-labeled freezer boxes provided by [CONTACT_587698] a -20 C or a -80 C degree freezer (-80 C 
is preferred if available but not  required) for storage until s hipped to URCC Research Base.  Cytokines 
(IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1 , IFN-, & TNFr1) will be assessed using Multiplex and ELISA methods a s 
appropriate.  The remaining serum  and plasma will be stored, as  part of study participation, for use in 
future research by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mustian, t he study PI, and her research team at the URCC Research Base.

8.1.4  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_587631]:  Upon notification of the Research Base that a 
NCORP has registered a cohort fo r this study, a starter blood d rawing package and an initial supply of 
barcoded and pre-labeled blood draw kits will be shipped to the NCORP for distribution and use.   Each NCORP site will be responsib le for designating someone on the research staff to be responsible for 
receiving the blood draw suppli es and kits.  The staff member w ill verify that the shipment contains the 
correct number of supplies and kits and that the supplies and k its are in good condition.  The 
identification numbers need to be verified for accuracy and recorded.  The Investigational Device Accountability Record (DARF) will be used to track supplies and  kits arriving from the Research Base,

9.[ADDRESS_773878] a trial comparing YOCAS
©® to a gold standard insomnia treatment for the general 
population:  We considered proposing a dism antling trial to determine whic h component of YOCAS©® is the 
most active.  However, after muc h deliberation with colleagues, we believe the study comparing YOCAS©® to 
CBT-I has significantly greater potential to impact standard of  care for insomnia among cancer survivors and, 
potentially, other populations.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_773879]:  In this study, we extend our pr evious findings by [CONTACT_587701]©® 
to CBT-I (a gold-standard treatment for insomnia in the general  population) and a health education intervention 
controlling for time and attenti on.  We also blind study partic ipants to control for demand characteristics and bias.  
We provide participants with “Y oga Kits,” including mat, strap,  Subject DVD, and manual to facilitate home 
practice during the intervention period and sustained practice during the following [ADDRESS_773880] effects of yoga on 
these outcomes and their mediational effects on insomnia throug h YOCAS©®.   
 
9.3 Length of Intervention—Why 4 and 8 Weeks:   We used a 4-week intervention period for YOCAS©®in our first 
study for two main reasons: 1) 4 weeks was the minimum length, in the published literature, shown to be 
efficacious for improving sleep problems, and 2) for practical purposes, we felt this length was reasonable for implementation in community se ttings via private oncology pract ices and would have good adherence.  We have 
chosen to retain the 4-week period for YOCAS
©® as it was previously shown to be effective and to compare it to  
CBT-I delivered over the gold-standard 8-week period.  We are a ware that new versions of brief and electronic 
CBT-I are currently being evaluate d for efficacy among survivor s, but we feel it is important to use the form of 
CBT-I shown to be effective among groups of cancer survivors in  published literature.   
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 33 of 43   
9.4 Length of Follow-Up—Why 3 and 6 Months:   We chose 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments because they 
will provide good information on the short and longer-term benefits of the yoga intervention, and, while clearly reflective of long-term influence, a 12-month follow-up is not practical within the time period of this R01-funded project.

single location within the 5-year time period of an R01.  We ha ve considerable experience successfully 
conducting large, multicenter phase III RCTs through the Research Base with our NCORP affiliates—accrual of the required [ADDRESS_773882].

10.0  Data Handling and Statistical Considerations 
___________________________________________ 
 
10.1 Sample Size and Statistical Power:   Allowing for 30% of participants who may not provide complete  data (as in 
our prior study), we will need to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_773883] 504 fully evaluable participants (168 
evaluable in each of the three study arms).  Fully evaluable pa rticipants is defined as having completed the On 
Study/ Participant Interview and the Clinical Record Informatio n (baseline), the ISI, PSQI, Daily Diaries, and 
actigraphy (baseline and post-in tervention assessments) for pri mary and secondary endpoints.  With [ADDRESS_773884]  80% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_773885] our hypotheses.  We will use a 
significance level of 0.025 to control for type I error because  two hypotheses (i.e., 1 inferiority [yoga vs. CBT-I] 
and 1 superiority [yoga vs. health education]) will be tested i n our primary aim.  [Note:  We will reimburse 
survivors for participating in this study in an effort to decrease attrition and data loss.]  
 
10.2 Power for Primary Aim 1:  The two primary hypotheses to be tested in our primary aim inc lude: (1) YOCAS©® 
will be as effective as CBT-I, and (2) YOCAS©® will be more effective than the  health education control.   
 10.2.1 Power for Hypothesis 1:   Based on baseline data from our previous phase III RCT examin ing the effects 
of yoga on insomnia and data from Savard58 and Morin,[ADDRESS_773886] a difference of 2.3 (half a standard deviation) between YOCAS©® and CBT-I as 
nontrivial.  Following the same methods as Garland and colleagu es,117 we set the non-inferiority margin 
to 1.15 (half of the 2.3 difference).  We will test the null hypothesis that the difference in mean change on 
the ISI between YOCAS©® and CBT-I is greater than 1.15; that is, YOCAS©® is inferior  to CBT-I.118,119 
Rejection of the null hypothesis means that YOCAS©® is as effective ( non-inferior)  as CBT-I.  Using 
ANCOVA to estimate differences in mean change between YOCAS©® and CBT-I, a correlation of 0.576 
(from our prior study), and a sample of [ADDRESS_773887] sufficient (80%) power to detect non-inferiority using a margin of 1.15 at p = 0.025.    
 
10.2.2 Power for Hypothesis 2:   Using ANCOVA to estimate differences in mean change between YO CAS
©® 
and health education, a correla tion of 0.576 (from our prior study), and a sample size of [ADDRESS_773888] 1.3, 1.5 and 
1.6 (all larger than our 1.15 non-inferiority margin) at 80%, 9 0%, and 95% power, respectively.118,119  
(Note: It is already well-established that CBT-I is superior to  general health education and equal time and 
attention, as such an overall test of group differences is not necessary or sufficient—the differences in 
question are specifically betw een yoga and CBT-I and yoga and h ealth education and require two separate 
hypotheses be tested.)  
10.3 Study Timeline:  Based on our prior experience conducting studies in the URCC Research Base, we anticipate 
that study start-up activities (e.g., obtaining NCI and IRB app rovals, presenting the protocol and training NCORP 
site staff, setting up databases, registration and randomization, ordering supplies and making kits and manuals, 
sending kits and other study supp lies to NCORPs) will take appr oximately [ADDRESS_773889] it will take between 24 and 47 months 
to accrue the 720 participan ts needed for this study.   
 
10.4 Representation of Women and Minorities:  None of the eligibility criteria for the study involve gender or 
ethnicity.  Past enrollment in our NCORP studies has closely pa ralleled the gender and ethnic composition of the 
available population.  See secti on 12.[ADDRESS_773890] used for our previous URCC 
Research Base protocols will be  used for this study.  Data will  be entered on scannable forms (Teleform) and 
electronically sent to a Microsoft Access database.  After scan ning, data are audited visually for errors, and then 
the entire database is re-audited.  MPLus, R and SAS statistical packages will be used for the analyses.   
 10.6 Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be performed at the two-tailed 5% lev el of significance.  Likewise, 
95% confidence intervals will be c onstructed for estimation of effects (e.g., difference in mean CRF, aerobic 
capacity, strength and QOL between  the active treatment group a nd the control group).  Data will be analyzed on 
an "intent-to-treat" basis; participant data will be included i n the treatment group to wh ich the participant was 
randomized, regardless of any subsequent changes to the treatme nt (treatment in this study  is considered the study 
intervention, i.e., exercise intervention, CBT-I, or Health edu cation standard care).   
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_773891]-treatment responses wi th common covariance matrices, after 
correction for the model fixed effects.  Bivariate normality wi ll be assessed with Roysten’s procedure, 
and equality of the covariance matrices will be assessed with t he Box M test.  The ISI data from our 
previous trial did not show violations of these assumptions.  If distributions are markedly skewed, we will 
apply transformations as appropriate.  The biomarker data will likely require a logarithmic 
transformation, as is common practice.   If heteroscedistic var iance is found in the residuals for any of the 
models, a Box-Cox transformation will be applied to the data.  As a last resort, appropriate nonparametric 
methods will be attempted, e.g. Wilcoxon rank sum test on chang e scores.111,[ADDRESS_773892] on the results.  However, the final analyses will include these data points.   
 
10.6.2 Missing Values.   Every effort will be made to facilitate participants' complet ion of questionnaires and 
provision of actigraphy and physical function data, and blood.120  In the event of missing data, the reasons 
for missing data will be recorded and tabulated according to treatment group.  Some missing data are inevitable. Under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, we will use multiple imputation to obtain unbiased estimates of key paramete rs.  If data are suspected to  be missing not at random (MNAR), a 
sensitivity analysis using the methods of Liublinska and Rubin (2014)
[ADDRESS_773893] on results. 112    If the estimates are similar to the ones obtained from the simpler analysis of only 
complete cases, we will report th e complete-case analysis resul ts. 112   
 
10.7 Statistical Analyses:   
 10.7.1 Primary Aim 1 Analyses:   To determine if YOCAS
©® is as effective as CBT-I and more effective than 
health education for improving insomnia (ISI total), two separate analyses will be performed, each 
aimed at estimating the differe nce between arms in mean change from baseline with associated 
confidence intervals.  The comparison of YOCAS©® to CBT-I is a non-inferiority hypothesis with a one-
sided alpha, and the comparison of YOCAS©® to the health educat ion control is a traditional null 
hypothesis of no difference with a two-sided alpha.118,119 See the Statistical Power section for more 
details.  A linear mixed effects ANCOVA will be used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in mean changes from baseline for the two groups (Hypothesis 1 = YOCAS
©® vs. CBT-I; 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 35 of 43  Hypothesis 2 = YOCAS©® vs. health education).  The response will be post-treatment ISI total score.   
The model fixed effects will be Group and Baseline ISI. NCORP S ite will be included as a random effect.  
The REML method will be used to es timate the random effect vari ance components.  If the NCORP Site 
variance component is significant , the fixed effects will be te sted using F tests with the Kenward-Roger 
degrees of freedom adjustment.[ADDRESS_773894]-squares estimation and F-Tests for t esting the fixed effects.  The mean 
difference between groups with associated 95% confidence interv als will be estimated using the 
appropriate contrasts.  An alpha l evel of 0.[ADDRESS_773895] for multiple comparisons.  
Additional follow-up analyses will include NCORP site and cohor t as covariates and examine possible 
interactions.   
 
10.7.2 Secondary Aim 2 Analyses:   To examine if YOCAS©® is effective for improving objective symptoms 
of insomnia (sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, slee p duration, and daytime nappi[INVESTIGATOR_587635]) and global sleep quality impairment (PSQI total) compared to CBT-I and a health 
education control, we will use the same methods as for Primary Aim 1 with no multiple comparison 
adjustments.123 
 10.7.3 Secondary Aim 3 Analyses:   To examine if YOCAS©® and CBT-I are effective for maintaining 
improvements in insomnia at [ADDRESS_773896]-intervention  compared to a health education 
control, we will perform a longitudinal analysis124 using the ISI total score at all five time points as the 
response.  The fixed effects will be Time, Group (all three in this analysis), and Time by [CONTACT_587702].  Within-subject random effects will initially be m odeled assuming an unstructured covariance 
matrix, but will be simplified after inspection of the estimate d covariance structure (e.g., compound 
symmetry).  If NCORP Site variance in the primary analysis is s tatistically significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_773897] of group on the time trajectory of insomnia will b e tested via the 
Time*Group interaction.  Least-s quares means for each Time and Group combination will be plotted to 
visualize and understand the time trajectories of insomnia.  Di fferences in time trajectories between the 
three groups will be tested with no adjustments for multiple co mparisons.123  
 10.7.4 Exploratory Mechanistic Aim 4 Analyses:   To explore whether YOCAS©® is effective for improving 
circadian activity rhythms (24 and 12 hour amplitudes and acrop hases via actigraphy), physical 
function (i.e., cardiopulmonary [6-min. walk] and muscular func tion [dynamometry]), and 
inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 , IL-1β, IFN-γ, & TNFR1 via standardized ELISAs and 
multiplexes)  compared to CBT-I and a health education control, we will use the same analytical methods 
as for Primary Aim 1 to assess changes in the estimated paramet ers of the two-oscillator (12 and 24 
hours) cosinor model97 and the Hill function model.125 These parameters include Mesor (M), Amplitude 
(A1) and Acrophase (Phi1) for the 24-hour oscillator and Amplit ude (A2) and Acrophase (Phi2) for 
the 12-hour oscillator .  Estimates will be from the log-transformed activity counts using nonlinear 
regression.  Degree of rhythmic ity will be assessed with the Fi sher-transformed model multiple 
correlation.  We will also fit si ngle-oscillator models (24-hou r Mesor, Amplitude, and Acrophase) for 
comparison with other published studies.20,24 The time participants woke up in the morning and fell asleep 
in the evening will be extracted from weekly diaries.  We will apply the same methods as for physical 
function and inflammation outcomes; inflammatory biomarkers wil l be log-transformed as needed. 
 10.7.5 Exploratory Mechanistic Aim 5 Analyses:   To explore whether changes in physical function, 
circadian rhythm and inflammation mediate the effect of YOCAS©®  on insomnia , we will use 
separate mediation analyses performed on pre-post ISI change sc ores (CS) and the above outcomes as 
potential mediators.  Path analysis will be used, where the intervention affects CS, the intervention affects the mediator, and the mediator, in turn, affects the CS.  We wi ll also use structural equation modeling.  
Mediation will be assessed via indirect effect estimation using bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals.
126,127  Latent variables will be introduced into the model for multip le measures of a common 
entity (e.g., cytokines for inflammation).  If multiple measure s are weakly correlated, we will split them 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 36 of 43  into separate measurement terms (e.g., pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines).  MPlus software will be 
used, with full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimatio n.  Under MAR, this provides less 
biased estimates due to missing data.   
 10.7.6 Additional Analyses:  The following analyses will be i nterpreted cautiously for hypo thesis generation.  
We will use the same analytical methods described for Aims 2, 3 , 4 and 5 to explore the interrelationships 
between insomnia, SQI, sleep chronotype, CRF, depression, anxie ty, mood, hormone therapy, pain,  
cognitive problems, symptoms, e xercise, cardiopulmonary function, strength, inflammation, stimulant and 
sleep medication use. 
 
10.7.7 Interim Analyses:   No interim analyses of efficacy data from the trial are plann ed.

12.0  Gender and Ethnic/Racial Minorities 
______________________________________  
 12.1 Minority Groups or Subgroups:   This clinical trial is open to both women and men who are sur vivors of cancer.   
 An estimate of minority particip ation from our U RCC Research Ba se accruals between 3/1/ 2011 and 2/29/2012 for 
three large phase III  clinical trials in o ur target population of cancer survivors indicates minority participation will be 
approximately 13%. O ur research group found 142 of the 1078 (13 .17%) patients accrued t o these clinical trials 
categorized themselves as being from an ethnic or racial minori ty.  One of these studies was  [CONTACT_142003]’s recently 
completed phase III clinical trial testing the effects of an ex ercise intervention on cancer-related fatigue.   
 [CONTACT_142003] has recently had s uccess increasing minority accrua ls on her local single-site studies in [COMPANY_002]ster, NY 
by [CONTACT_587704].   
 Male cancer patients have been  underrepresented in yoga trials for cancer patients.  In a systematic review and 
meta-analysis conducted in [ADDRESS_773901] cancer; 11 recruite d only female patients, and one reported that 5% of 
their sample was male.  The thirteenth trial was a small (N=38)  pi[INVESTIGATOR_587636]; 39% of this 
sample was male.53  In an analysis of population-based data, similarly, only 3.5% of men in the [LOCATION_002] 
reported practicing yoga, c ompared to 10% of women.119  
 
To ensure sufficient representation of male cancer patients in the current trial, the following steps will be taken.  
Research coordinators at the NCORP sites will be instructed to screen specifically for and oversample male 
cancer patients in their recruitm ent efforts, to account for the potential reticence of men to engage in a group-
based yoga intervention.  Wher e possible, coordinators conducting recruitment will be gender matched to the 
patients they are recruiting (i.e., male coordinators recruiting male patients, female coor dinators recruiting female 
patients).  Recruitment and study materials, including study ma nuals include both ma le and female models. 
 
For this study, our goal is to increase minority recruitment to 18% (a 5% increase).  We will work closely with our 
minority-based NCORPs to ensure they have the resources and hel p they need to open this study and to effectively 
recruit participants and conduct the study.  We will also work closely with our non-minority-based NCORPs to 
support increased minority accrua ls at all of our  affiliated NC ORPs.  We will provide each NCORP with culturally 
 
 
[ZIP_CODE] Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean  Page 38 of 43  sensitive recruitment materials.  Lastly, our IRB and all of ou r NCORP IRBs mandate that all study materials and 
measures meet federal guidelines and can be easily understood b y individuals without a high school degree.  
 
In addition, we will meet quarter ly with Research Base staff an d annually with all NCORPs; at face-to-face 
meetings and on audits where we will discuss minority recruitme nt levels and make adjustments in our 
recruitment strategies as needed  in an earnest effort to increase minority recruitment for this trial.

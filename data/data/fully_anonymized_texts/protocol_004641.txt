This is a research study and will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable University of 
Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws  and 
regulations as applicable.  
1 Introduction 
Maintaining a child’s circadian rhythm during their critical illness may strengthen their resilience and, in the very least, not burden a child’s already compromised state. Optimizing CR during critical illness has 
been shown to be feasible and safe, improve patient -important outcomes, and is therefore now 
recommended as one of the best practices and priorities among adult ICUs. Although each R2 element is currently practiced in [ADDRESS_335455] 
step in a paradigm shift is to ensure there is supporting evidence for the planned change in care. 
Therefore, a systematic approach is urgently needed to optimize the healing milieu in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_274469] a result of disrupted circadian rhythms in PI[INVESTIGATOR_274470].  Our interprofessional team believes that PI[INVESTIGATOR_274471] a child’s circadian rhythm (CR), support their physiological resilience and enhance their capacity 
to heal. The recent completion of the RESTORE clinical trial (HL086622, PI [INVESTIGATOR_274472]) provides evidence 
that critically ill children can be safely managed in a more awake state. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_274473]! (PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_274474]), an intervention promoting early progressive exercise and mobility in critically ill children, 
supports its safety and feasibility.  We believe that more awake, responsive and active children who 
receiv e CR -restoring interventions may derive benefit.  Our team, with expertise in pediatric critical care 
nursing, medicine, sleep, and pharmacology intends to shift the current PI[INVESTIGATOR_274475]. It is hypothesized that patients managed per 
RESTORE resilience will experi ence a more restorative circadian rhythm evidenced by [CONTACT_274528]- wake pattern than patients receiving usual care. The overall aim of this study is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_274476], RESTORE  resilie nce (R2), in pediatri c patients on 
mechanical ventilation for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].   
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
Each year, more than 250,000 infants and children in the US receive care in a PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890], and more than 100,000 are supported on mechanical ventilation (MV ). (8) With improved mortality, the focus of PI[INVESTIGATOR_274477].  (9-11) In adults, we

 know that disruptions in CR may impair mentation, immunity, autonomic function, endocrine activity, 
hormonal signaling, and ultimately healing. (12-15) As acuity of illness increases, circadian rhythmicity 
may be abolished. (16,17) Causes of circadian disruption may be environmental or internal to the 
patient. (18) For example, i nadequat e daytime illuminatio n and increases in nocturnal light, coupled with 
sudden and frequent peaks in noise with high baseline noise levels, negatively impact both sleep onset 
and sleep continuity in the  ICU. Intrinsic causes of circadian disruption include c ritical illness itsel f and the 
patient’s experiences with distress and pain. Moreover, melatonin is integral to the maintenance of circadian rhythms and regulation of sleep, and derangements in melatonin secretion among adult ICU 
patients are associated with sleep disturbances . (12,16,18- 24) In pediatrics, sleep recommendations are 
age-based and reflect neurologic maturation. (25-29) While we know that sleep quality is poor in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890], 
data regarding the clinical effects of sleep disturbances in cri tically ill children are severely lacking. (25,30 -
32) Thus, it is not surprising that a recent survey of pediatric intensivists revealed that the vast majority of 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_274478]. (33) Currently, PI[INVESTIGATOR_274479]. This practice is 
disconcerting because CR/sleep disruption is a known contributor to ICU delirium.  (13,34 ) Without data 
on the physical and psychological benefits of sleep in sick children, long- established hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274480].  
[ADDRESS_335456] RESTORE resilience (R2), a [ADDRESS_335457] design. Two 
separate PI[INVESTIGATOR_274481] 10 baseline subjects followed by 20 intervention subjects, 6 months to 18 
years of age, who are intubated and mechanically ventilat ed for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Specifically, as 
soon as possible after PI[INVESTIGATOR_7035], parents will be interviewed to create an individualized 
chronotherapeutic bundle to include (1) focused effort  to replicate the child’s pre- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274482] (bedtime/wake tim e, bedtime/arousal routine, nap time, feeding schedule, active periods), (2) 
cycled day -night lighting and modulation of sound to match the child’s routine, (3) minimal yet effect ive 
sedation using a nurse -implemented goal -directed sedation plan ( RESTORE),  (4) night fasting with bolus 
enteral daytime feedings, (5) early, developmentally -appropriate, progressive exercise and mobility (PI[INVESTIGATOR_274483]!), (6) continuity in nursing care, and (7) parent diaries. The overall objective of this study is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test 
an intervention that can be implemented in any PI[INVESTIGATOR_274484] -wake patterns with

3.2 Allocation to Interventional Group [if applicable]  
Following the baseline phase, all subjects will be enrolled in the intervention phase.  No randomization or 
subject group allocation will occur.   
3.3 Study Measures 
All patients  will be  enrolled within 24 hours of PI[INVESTIGATOR_7035]. Using medical records, patient monitoring 
and environmental monitoring , the following data will be collected for this study.

nonverbal cognitively impaired children age 6 and older, or the Wong- Baker Faces Pain 
Scale (WBFPS) in verbal children age 3 and older. All pain scales range 0 -10 with higher 
scores indicating more pain.  
b. Level of sedation in intubated patients is assessed using the State Behavioral Scale (SBS).71 SBS scores range from -3 (unresp onsive) to +2 (agitated).  
c. In patients receiving neuromuscular blockade, pain/agitation is judged to be present by

in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304].  
e. Patients weaning from ≥5 days of sedation are monitored for IWS using the Withdra wal 
Assessment Tool -1 (WAT -1). The WAT -1 scale ranges 0- 12 with higher scores indicating 
more withdrawal symptoms.

Subjects for this study will be recruited via daily PI[INVESTIGATOR_274500].  Consecutive patients admitted to 
the PI[INVESTIGATOR_274501] s will be reviewed for eligibility  (based on medical record) and if eligible 
invited to participate. After verifying the patient's eligibility status, the patient ’s legal guardian or parent(s) 
will be introd uced to the research team by a member of the patients care team and informed consent will 
be requested from the parent or legal guardian. Recruitment  will end when 60 subjects are enrolled. 
  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
This study involves children.  At the time of enrollment , the patient ’s legal guardian/parents will be 
introduced to the research team by a member of the patient ’s care team and informed consent will be 
requested from the parent or legal guardian. Due to existing medical conditions (e.g. sedati on, 
mechanical ventilation) minor  assent will not  be obtained.  Although not directly targeted, mentally 
disabled persons, economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, and/or employees or students of 
the University of Pennsylvania or other involved institutions will not be denied enrollment and an y special 
protections and/or additional safeguards will be undertaken in order to protect the rights and welfare of 
these subjects from coercion or undue influence as appropriate.  
5 Study Procedures  
Following informed consent, during the baseline phase, all patient care will be managed at the discretion of the clinical care team.  The study will not provide care recommendations or changes to tre atment  
during the baseline phase.

exclusionary medical condition or medication).  The Investigator may also withdraw subject s who violate 
the study plan,  to protect the subject for reasons related to safet y or for administrative reasons.  It will be 
documented whether or not  each subject compl etes the  study. Subjects who with draw early will have one 
final visi t to collect final evaluations and assess adverse events.   
5.2.1 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw consent to participate in the study will be seen for one final study visit. During this 
visit they will be asked for permission to  assess their survival status via medical records .   
6 Statistical Plan 
The study design will allow multiple comparisons; specifically baseline to intervention group and cross -
unit comparisons. The specific aim of the study is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_274506] , an individualized 
chronotherapeutic bundle, in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_274507]. The study design is a two-phase  prospective cohort study. Subjects will be 
consecutively enrolled into the Baseline Phase and then into the Intervention Phase in two separate 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_174927] . Each unit will e nroll 10 baseline subjects followed by 20 intervention subjects (total: 20 baseline 
subjects and 40 intervention subjects). Outcome variables are designed to be as objective as possible 
since it is not possible to blind the assessor to treatment phase.

6.2 Statistical Methods 
For purposes of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we assume that subjects managed per R2 will exhibit maintain circadi an 
rhythmicity and demonstrate an improved sleep- wake pattern, as evidenced by [CONTACT_274533] (daytime activity/total 24 -hr activity) post -extubati on, compared to those managed per usual 
care. Preliminary data from current studies in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_274509] 50% of activity occurs during the 
nighttime hours in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]. We anticipate that the R2 intervention will result in a decrease in nighttime 
activi ty to 30% of total activity. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_274510] a future trial.  
6.[ADDRESS_335468] descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for 
categorical variables such as gender).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_335469] 
Analysis of the primary outcome: Average circadian activity ratio, defined as daytime activity/total 24-hr activity, after extubation as demonstrated by [CONTACT_55629]. Daytime will be defined as 7 am -7 pm. Validated 
in infants and children, actigraphs capture activity counts in 1-minute epochs which can be compared 
between daytime and nighttime hours as a marker of circadian rhythm. Because activity levels vary 
between patients (i.e., a child with cerebral palsy and/or muscle weakness will not produce the same activity amplitude as a healthy child), the circadian activity ratio provides a method of normalizing the data 
to account for each patient’s baseline amplitude. Increases in the daily circadian activity ratio would 
suggest improvement in day -night rest -activity patterns and sleep consolidation over time.

unanticipated benefit. Patients will be monitored daily to determine whether an event has occurred. All 
adverse events will be recorded on an adverse event case report form. Serious adverse events (death, 
life threatening, new serious or permanent disability) will be reported within [ADDRESS_335470] (IRB). Recommended protocol modifications will be 
implemented immediately. A description of all undesirable experiences or unanticipated benefits will be 
recorded on the case report form. In addition, the required interventions, patient’s condition after the 
event, an estimate of the extent of injury, and prevention strategies will be reported. The relationship of 
the study protocol to the event will be classified by a consensus of the bedside team as follows:  
• Not related: The event is clearly related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, not with therapeutic interventions associated with the study protocol.  
• Remot e: The event was most likely related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, not with 
therapeutic interventions associated with the study protocol.  
• Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the implementation of the protocol and/or is consistent with known events related to the protocol but is possibly related to 
factors such as the subject’s clinical state.  
• Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the implementation of the 
protocol and/or is consistent  with known events related to the protocol and cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_274534]’s clinical state.  
• Highly Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the implementation of the protocol and/or is consistent with known events related to the implementation of the protocol and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_274534]’s clinical  state. In addition, the 
event occurs immediately following the implementation of the protocol, or improves when discontinuing the protocol, or reappears on the repeat  implementation of the protocol.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
The severity of an adverse event in both phases is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of 
intensity of an adverse event as determined by a consensus of the bedside team as follows:  
• Mild:  Does not impact (in anyway) the patient’s course of illness.  
• Moderate: Impacts the subject’s course of illness but is not life- threatening or incapacitating.  
• Severe: Fatal, life threatening, permanently disabling; severely incapacitating; requires/prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
The principal investigators will immediately follow- up on all serious events on a case- by-case basis. All 
adverse events will  be summarized and reviewed on a monthly basis.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_335471], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be  
recorded in the CRF.

 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  All study related SAE's will be 
reported to the IRB in writing by [CONTACT_116313] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the event. The following guidelines will be 
followed: 1) A letter will summarize any adverse events or events that occurred, the patient's name [CONTACT_274545]. The event outcome will be described. 2) An original and [ADDRESS_335472] to expedited 
reporting. The NIH will be notified (by [CONTACT_756], fax, or writing) as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_335473] knowledge by [CONTACT_274535] a case qualifies, followed by [CONTACT_185548] a report as possible within 8 additional calendar days. The NIH report will include:  
• Patient details: initials, subje ct number, gender, age and/or DOB, weight, and height.  
• Intervention that resulted in AE or SAE  
• Other treatments (same as above) for all other concomitant medicinal products.  
• Details of the SAE: description of the event (signs and symptoms/diagnosis); why  this is 
considered serious (criteria); onset and duration of the event; dechallenge/ rechallenge 
information; setting.  
• Outcome: information on recovery and any sequelae; specific treatments/tests and results; cause 
of death; autopsy or post mortem report s.  
• Reporter - name, profession, address, and phone number.  
• Determinants of causality - temporal (time) association, known AEs, subject's current state of 
health, response to dosage change, concomitant medications, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_274512]. 
 
7.4.1 Follow -up R eport  
If an AE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to the IRB.

Version: 9/18/[ADDRESS_335475] of 1996 (HIPAA).  The parental permission form 
for this study inform s the parent/ subject of the following:  
• What protecte d health information (PHI) will be collected in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that i nformation  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authoriz ation for use of their PH .  
 
After providing informed consent/parental permission/assent, the subje ct will be assigned a unique case 
number. This number will be used to label all private r esearch information, including clinical assessments 
and saliva swabs. Original signed informed consent  forms will be kept in a locked cabinet in a private 
office. All data and photographs will be entered directly into a password- protected database that will be 
maintained on a password -protected network drive. Access to the server is through a password -protected 
account that allows access to data collected only to the investigator and their designees. Consent logs and other research records will be kept for [ADDRESS_335476] vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study peri od. 
8.2 Data Collection and Management  
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will work with the MPI [INVESTIGATOR_274513] a web -based Data 
Management System (DMS) using the REDCap electronic data capture system. According to 
programmed workflow logic, the DMS will generate electronic Case Report Forms as needed for each 
patient (e.g., daily forms, study discharge form). The DMS allows for the data to be viewed in real time by 
[CONTACT_274536]. Many automated logic and range checks and cross -form validations will be  programmed to ensure data quality, and audit trails will be 
maintained.  
 The DCC will w ork with each clinical center to ensure that database training and certification is obtained 
by [CONTACT_274537], data queries are resolved, and data- related questions are 
answered promptly.  
 
The DCC will transfer electronic data files as needed in a secure and confidential manner. The DCC will 
also create reports as needed by [CONTACT_18121], for study quality review (e.g., monthly protocol adherence 
reports), and for review as needed by [CONTACT_274538].  
 Confidentiality  will be maintained throughout the study in the following ways:  
 
1) All data will be de- identified then stored in the secure REDCap database or in the Excel 
database, as appropriate.  
2) Specimens will be de- identified and stored in lockable research freezers, and each participant will 
be assigned a unique identification number.  
3) A master list (linking PHI to study ID) will be  housed separately f rom all data forms  (both paper 
and electronically).  The master list will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_205557] a password 
protected file within Excel  on computers on accessible by [CONTACT_274539].

 8.3 Records Retention 
Study records will be retained per applicable NIH and Penn IRB requirements.   Records will be stored in 
locked cabinets, in locked offices only accessible to the study team.  
9 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
9.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
The study MPIs will be responsible for ensuring the ongoing quality and integrity of the research study.   
9.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the sponsor, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable stud y-related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic la boratory, etc.).  
 
10 Ethical Considerations 
10.1 Risks 
Privacy and Confidentiality : Strict measur es will be taken to ensure participant privacy and confidentiality. 
All data will be de- identified then stored in the secure REDCap database or in the Excel database, as 
appropriate. Specimens will be de-identified and stored in lockable research freezers,  and each 
participant will be assigned a unique identification number. The master list linking identification numbers  
to identifying information will be stored separately from the study database. All personally identifiable information will be kept strictly confidential and stored in an encrypted document, on a dedicated r esearch 
server only accessible by [CONTACT_5051].  
Risk associated with EEG and ankle/wrist monitoring includes irritation at the site and will be minimized by [CONTACT_274540], and removal of the device if irritation or redness occurs.  
 
The major components of RESTORE are a standard of care in each PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]. The current study is testi ng 
the feasibility of implementing the entire 7- item bundle of activities/clinical care w ithin a PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890], it is not 
testing each item within the bundle.  Risk a ssociated with over and /or under sedation will b e minimized 
by [CONTACT_274541].  
 Risks associated with bolus feed included gastro- esophageal reflux and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. However, children 
who are at risk for reflux and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_274514]. Children who have clinical signs 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_274515]. Reflux precautions including head of bed at 300 will be implemented when appropriate.  
 Risks from progressive mobility incl ude inadvertent tube/catheter dislodgement. However, these risks are 
minimized since the care models at both Johns Hopkins and CHOP have incorporated progressive 
mobility as part of the standard of care, and are well trained with this intervention. Children at high risk for 
tube and or catheter dislodgment will not participate in this activity.

10.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA A uthorization  
 All parents/legal guardians of the potential subjects  for this study will be provided a consent form 
describing this study providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.  T his consent form will be approved  by [CONTACT_274542].  The formal 
consent of a subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, wi ll be obtained before that subject 
undergoes any study procedure.  T he parent/legal guardian, will  sign the consent form, and the 
investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent. Subjects will be consented by [CONTACT_274543], or appropriate designee. Potential subjects will review the consent form in 
detail with the person designated to consent (either PI [INVESTIGATOR_160551]) and have the ability to take the consent 
home for further review.  
 
In the event of a health pandemic we wi ll use telephone consent and obtain an electronic signature [CONTACT_138365] 
R2 parental permission form . This will only be used if  parents are prevented from accompanying their 
child in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274516] a pandemic.   If ever necessary,  we would help the site use an existing e-
signature [CONTACT_274546] a new one.
 
 Participants will be informed that their participation in all aspects of the proposed study is entirel y 
volun tary, and that they are free to withdraw at any time. The consent process, which will follow an item-
by-item reading of the IRB -approved consent  form,  will include a n explanation of the st udy, its voluntary 
nature, compensation, and the risks and benefits of parti cipation. Consent forms will be written a t no 
higher than a 6th grade reading level. All participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and 
decline participation. Assent cannot be obtained because children of assenting age will be intubated and 
sedated. The completed consent document  will be sig ned and dated by [CONTACT_94110], 
and a copy will be provided to the participating family. Signed consent form s will be stored in a locked 
cabinet. Should participants become intolerant of the study, their participation will be discontinued. 
Contact [CONTACT_274544] [INVESTIGATOR_274517]. Should any specific concerns 
arise, the study team would intervene to  address problems including, if needed, a change or 
discontinuation of study procedures. The st udy te am and IRB will be informed of any con cerns, and the  
NIH will be informed of any adverse events associated with the study.

RESEARCH PLAN  
These are instructions are for completing the Research Plan are available from the HRPP website.  
The headings on this set of instructions correspond to the headings of the Research Plan.  
General Instructions: Enter a response in for all topic headings.  
Enter “Not Applicable” rather than leaving an item blank if the item does not apply to this project.  
Version date: 10/29/[ADDRESS_22214] patients with preserved left ventricular function receive dual chamber pacemakers; however, right ventricular api[INVESTIGATOR_23193].   
Many patients receiving dual chamber pacemakers for symptomatic bradycardia have prolonged 
intrinsic AV conduction (first degree AV block), and as a result, will receive a significant amount of ventricular pacing if programmed at physiologic AV intervals.  As an alternative, many pacemakers can be programmed to minimize ventricular pacing at the expense of allowing longer AV delays; however, these long AV delays are also not physiologic and may also lead to reduced cardiac output.  The main scientific questions being addressed in this study are to evaluate the acute effects on cardiac output with a long AV delay allowing for intrinsic conduction as compared to an echocardiographically optimized AV delay during dual chamber pacing, and then to follow the patients to see if there are any remodeling changes related to a high degree of RV pacing.   
 
8. PRELIMINARY STUDIES /PROGRESS REPORT  
             There is a paucity of data in the type of patients being enrolled in this study.  There is only one small 
study (reference 3) which did show a benefit to AV delay optimization with dual chamber pacing.  However, this study was done before the new pacing modalities with MVP and the like that allow for longer AV intervals, and also before the data with regard to the potential detrimental effects of RV pacing. As such, this prior  study 
(reference 3) had no follow  up data on what would happen with the increased pacing over time, and is also

investigation.  
 
9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Study Design: 
 This will be a randomize d, prospective clinical trial.  All patients enrolled will undergo echocardiographic 
evaluation with AV delay optimization which will be compared to intrinsic conduction, and thus patients will serve as their own controls with respect to the acute hemodyna mic data.  
           After observing the acute hemodynamic effects of AV delay optimization vs. intrinsic conduction, patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_22215] of clinical care.  
 Methods: Patients who have AV conduction with long PR intervals (>230 msec)  with preserved LV function who are receiving dual chamber pacemakers for symptomatic bradycardia will be evaluated by [CONTACT_23198].  Baseline aortic TVI, as a surrogate of cardiac output, will be measured and will be compared with aortic TVI with AAI pacing at [ADDRESS_22216] 
aortic Doppler flow velocities in the api[INVESTIGATOR_23194]: 220, 200, 
180, 160, 140, 120, 100, [ADDRESS_22217] average aortic Doppler VTI.   
Measurements of diastolic dysfunction and dyssynchrony will also be re- evaluated with AAI pacing and 
with DDD pacing at optimized AV delays to evaluate the effects of pacing on these parameters as well.  
Patients will then be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_22218] a comprehensive follow up 2D echo at 6 months after randomization to assess for any potential changes related to RV pacing including, RV function, LV function, LV end -systolic 
volume, LV end-diastolic volumes, wall thickness, and dyssynchrony as assessed by [CONTACT_23199].     
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
A total of 40 patients will be recruited from the Cardiology Electrophysiology clinics of either gender for  
Echocardiography and AV delay optimization.  Inclusion Criteria: (all must be met)  
 1. Must have Symptomatic bradycardia requiring dual chamber pacemaker

  Exclusion Criteria: (presence of any one or more)  1. Complete or high grade AV block             2. Persistent Atrial F ibrillation  
 3. EF < 45%             4. Patient’s refusal to participate in the study  
 
 
11. RECRUITMENT  
Patients will be recruited from the Cardiology Elec trophysiology clinic.  [CONTACT_23204] will review the potential 
patients’ eligibility and if eligible, he or she will be consented in the clinic and will follow up as per protocol. 
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Only th e principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_23195], after complete explanation of the nature 
and purpose of this study.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
 
Participation in the study is voluntary, and patients may choose to not parti cipate in this study. These patients will 
continue to get routine follow up as indicated for their medical condition.  
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
The published literature indicates that there are no known immediate or delayed or long- term risks from 
ultrasound imaging using the ultrasound output levels and techniques for routine ultrasound exams.  The AV optimization involves temporary programming changes, and an electrophysiologist will be present throughout the programming.  In the unlikely event that a patient does not tolerate a change in pacemaker mode, the pacemaker will be reset to its initial mode and that patient’s study will be terminated.  
 After final programming, patients will be followed and pacemaker adjustments made as per routine clinical care.  F ollow up echocardiograms will be obtained to ensure there are no significant changes in cardiac function 
with pacing.  If any changes are noted, the pacemakers will be adjusted as per routine clinical practice.   
 
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQU ACY OF RESOURCES  
Patient s will be monitored for any adverse event s with routine clinic visits [ADDRESS_22220] of clinical care.   Patients will also be 
enrolled and followed by [CONTACT_23200] (weather or not this is possible depends on the brand of pacemaker  implanted , and if they have a home telephone line). 
 
The arrhythmia clinic is staffed by [CONTACT_23201] a dedicated technician  for pacemaker 
interrogations and related issues .  We currently follow over 1,000 patients with implanted intracardiac devices. 
The clinic number ([PHONE_373] is answered daily from [ADDRESS_22221] numbers will be used only to retrieve (1) 
the final interpretation reports of the pre-pacing and post-pacing echocardiographic examinations and (2) demographic data, as described above. We will strictly maintain patient confidentiality and destroy pa tient 
identifying data immediately after data collection. Data collection forms will include only identifying research numbers—patient names, birthdates, and medical record numbers will not be used. Further, PHI will not be re-used of disclosed for other purposes. All data will be kept in a locked cabinet accessible only by [CONTACT_458].  Any data kept on a computer will be encrypted and password protected.  Patients who may have any questions or concerns can contact [CONTACT_23202][INVESTIGATOR_136]or  [INVESTIGATOR_136] 619 543 -5428  or the 
HRPP  
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
It is possible that AV delay optimization guided by [CONTACT_23203], and quality of life.   
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
 
It is possible that AV delay optimization will improve hemodynamics with regard to cardiac output which may 
improve energy levels and quality of life.  There is very little risk to echocardiographically optimizing the AV delay.  Patients will be followed close ly after pacemaker placement and programming at [ADDRESS_22222] udy.

Vector to Deliver the Human CHM  Gene [ AAV2 -hCHM ] to the 
Retina  
 
Sponsor  Spark Therapeutics , Inc. 
 
Clinical Phase  Phase 1 /2 
 
Study Rationale  Gene delivery vectors based on Adeno- Associated Virus (AAV) 
have been in development for nearly three decades  (Samulski et al.,  
1982; Samulski et al.,  1987) . Numerous non- clinical research 
studies in mice, dogs and non- human primates have demonstrated 
safety and efficacy of AAV vectors encoding a variety of transgenes 
for a number of different conditions , as well as clinical studies 
encompassing a wide spectrum of diseases  (Mingozzi and High, 
2011) . Over the past several years, the first clinical trials in humans 
using AAV vectors for retinal disease have shown remarkabl e 
results, for both safety and clinical outcomes . Groundbreaking 
studies of AAV vectors by [CONTACT_622737] -recessive mutations 
in the human retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] 65 kDa protein gene 
(RPE65 ), have preliminarily demonstrated safety, tolerability, as 
well as efficacy for several endpoints initially in P hase 1 studies 
employing unilateral administration, and then in follow -on studies 
injecting the previously uninjected, contralateral  eye (Maguire et al.,  
2008; Bainbridge et al.,  2008; Hauswirth et al.   2008; Maguire et 
al., 2009; Bennett et al.,  2012) . The twelve  subjects entered to the 
Phase 1 clinical trial conducted under U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA) Investigational New Drug ( IND) #[ADDRESS_829254] approvals in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe 
(LUXTURNATM), other retinal genetic diseases are being 
considered for gene transfer using AAV vectors encoding 
therapeutic proteins .  
Choroideremia is a degenerative retinal disease for which gene 
transfer research is in progress, including a clinical trial in the [LOCATION_008]  (MacLaren  et al. , 2014) . This X -linked disease of 
males is characterized by [CONTACT_622738]2 -hCHM -101     Page viii 
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  choroideremia gene (CHM ) at Xq21.2 , resulting in defective or 
absent Rab escort protein -1 (REP-1), the encoded protein of the 
CHM  gene (Nussbaum et al.,  1985; Seabra et al.,  1993; Seabra et 
al., 1995; Cremers et al.,  1994; Alexandrov et al.,  1994) . Normally, 
Rab proteins are escorted by R EP-1 to Rab 
geranylgeranyltransferase (Rab GGTase), which attaches 
geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins at the carboxy terminal ends 
(prenylation), an essential process that  activates Rab proteins for 
their role in intracellular vesicular transport (Alexandrov et al.,  
1994) . In this way, R EP-1 binds to newly synthesized Rab proteins, 
presents them to Rab GGTase, and delivers the geranylgerany lated 
Rab proteins to their target membranes. Absence or deficiency of 
REP-1 due to deletions or mutations in the CHM  gene leads to 
cellular apoptosis and degeneration of the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE) , choroid, and retinal photoreceptors. Although i n 
normal retinas, the CHM  gene is expressed in multiple cell types, 
including retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836], photoreceptors and choroidal 
cells, there is evidence that the RPE cell is the primary disease-
causing cell type. This evidence stems from observations in 
conditional knockout mice  (Tolmachova et al.,  2006; Tolmachova 
et al.,  2006) and also from studies evaluating efficacy of lentivirus -
mediated gene transfer (which targets RPE cells preferentially). The 
AAV serotype 2 vector, which targets R PE cells primarily  (and 
other retinal cell types secondarily) is thus an ideal vector for choroideremia. Unlike lentivirus, AAV2 carries a very low risk of insertional mutagenesis.  
Clinically, choroideremia is diagnosed in affected males who 
manifest night  blindness in childhood, followed by [CONTACT_622739], usually symptomatic in their teenage years, and eventual total blindness. The pathological hallmarks of 
the disease are degeneration of the choroicapi[INVESTIGATOR_167583], as well as retinal  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_622717]  (MacDonald et al.,  2009) . 
The disease course is variable, with early manifestations of 
decreased dark adaptation, progressing to decreased peripheral 
vision, followed eventually by [CONTACT_622740], generally 
occurring later in life. In some patients, blindness occurs after a 
prolonged course. The rationale for a gene transfer approach for choroideremia is that a corrective gene delivered to the RPE early 
enough in the cl inical course may halt degeneration and re store the 
RPE, retinal vasculature, and photoreceptors.  
This clinical study proposes to deliver the normal human CHM  gene 
(hCHM ) to the subretinal space using AAV2 -hCHM , a single -
stranded AAV vector, based on several considerations. Previous clinical resu lts from FDA Biologics License Application  (BLA ) 
application # 125610 (IND # [ZIP_CODE] ) demonstrated that following 
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page ix 
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  subretinal administration of the AAV2 -hRPE65v2  vector, 
stabilization or improvement of light sensitivity and visual endpoint 
measures occurred in each of the twelve  participating subjects  
(Maguire et al.,  2008; Maguire et al.,  2009; Bennett et al.,  2012) . 
When tested in cell lines in vitro  and in mice at doses similar to 
those used for AAV2- hRPE65v2, the AAV2 -hCHM  vector showed 
robust levels of transgene expression as judged by [CONTACT_622741], prenylation activity and 
restoration of Rab27 trafficking to the cellular membranes of 
induced pluripotent cells from affected patients (Vasireddy et al.,  
2013) . Non-clinical toxicity studies conducted in animals (mice, 
dogs, non- human primates) have demonstrated an acceptable safety 
profile for AAV2 serotype vectors (Acland et al ., 2001; Acland et 
al., 2005; Bennicelli et al ., 2008; Bennett et al ., unpublished data), 
and bio- distribution studies from these studies indicate  limited 
spread of the AAV2- serotyped vector following subretinal 
administration. An AAV2 -REP-[ADDRESS_829255] effects  and some indication  of efficacy  
(MacLaren et al.,  2014; Edwards et al.,  2016). These results 
comprising the use of AAV2-hRPE65v2 in non- clinical and  clinical 
studies of inherited retinal degeneration due to autosomal -recessive  
RPE65  gene mutations , along with non- clinical studies of the 
AAV2 -hCHM  vector both in vitro  and in mice  (Vasireddy et al.,  
2013), support further clinical investigation.     
In this regard, production and characterization of AAV vectors at the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics ( CCMT ) at The 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] ( CHOP ) have been successfully 
completed for several vectors used in clinical gene transfer studies. 
Over the years, the CCMT Clinical Vector Core (CVC) has 
developed and implemented a number of processing steps to 
increase the uniformity and potential efficacy of AAV vectors. The manufacturing proce ss for AAV vectors at the CCMT CVC 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_276019] a homogeneous product with substantial reduction of  empty capsid  particle s. Reduc ing the empty  capsid  
particles in the  final vector product may have an advantage when 
delivering an AAV vector to the eye, by [CONTACT_622742]. In 
addition, substantial reduction of empty capsid s ensures that cell 
surface receptors in the relatively restricted area of the injection bleb 
are not blocked by [CONTACT_622743], but rather that each vector 
particle that attaches to cell surface receptors carries a DNA payload.

Study Phases  
Screening /Baseline  
Study Intervention  
Follow- Up   Screening /Baseline: Initial screening for eligibility is based 
primarily on documentation of the underlying CHM  gene mutation 
by a CLIA -certified  laboratory in an individual with choroideremia ; 
this genetic diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_622718] a clinical study . If the screening indicates 
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page xiii 
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  Long -Term Follow -
Up potential eligibility, gene therapy informed consent  is conduct ed 
prior to the extensive Baseline evaluation . The Baseline evaluation 
will be  compris ed of medical  history and comprehensive visual and 
laboratory assessments  (including confirmation of genetic diagnosis  
if adequate records are not available) . If all of t he criteria indicate 
study eligibility, the subject is offered the opportunity of vector 
administration and participation in the active phase of the study.  
Study Intervention  (Vector Administration ): After confirmation of 
eligibility and subject agrees to study entry , the investigational 
product ( AAV2 -hCHM ) is administered in the operating room  on 
Day [ADDRESS_829258]’s non- preferred eye (o r the eye with worse visual acuity  
if the subject has no preference) . The subject is maintained for up to  
[ADDRESS_829259]-operative supi[INVESTIGATOR_622719].   
Active Phase Follow- Up: Analyses will include  safety endpoints 
such as adverse events, comprehensive blood and urine laboratory 
tests, vector presence in blood and tears, pregnancy outcomes (in 
female partners of subjects), as well as ophthalmologic safety and 
efficacy endpoints including ophthalmic examination, and measures 
of visual function, functional vision, ophthalmologic imaging, and quality of life (QOL) questionnaire. The schedule of evaluations in 
the active phase will be conducted over an approximately 2- year 
period post vector administration to assess safety and efficacy of 
AAV2 -hCHM  (including the administration ), comparing the 
findings obtained longitudinally from the injected eye with thos e of 
the uninjected eye serving as the control.   
Long- Term Follow -Up: LTFU, u p to 5 years following vector 
administration , will be conducted to characterize the clinical 
outcome and the type and seriousness of adverse events following 
the AAV2 -hCHM gene transfer , as specified in the January 2020 
FDA guidance document entitled, “Long Term Follow -Up After 
Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products .” Assessments 
will include adverse events, history, physical and ophthalmic examinations, blood tests, urinalysis, pregnancy outcomes (in 
female partners of subjects) and retinal/visual function tests. A ll 
adverse event s will be collected during the LTFU period and
 
reporti ng will focus on those  events related to the prior 
administration of AAV2 -hCHM and the development or 
exacerbation of oncologic, hematologic, neurologic, and 
autoimmune events as specified in the November 2006 FDA 
guidance document entitled, “Gene Therapy Clinical Trials – 
Observing Subjects for Delayed  Adverse Events.” The LTFU p hase 
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page xiv 
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  seeks to provide longitudinal information, and should adverse 
events occur, more timely discovery and treatment.  
 
Efficacy Evaluations  Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by [CONTACT_622747], as 
measured by [CONTACT_622748] : Ophthalmologic 
examination, visual acuity (VA) by [CONTACT_622749], visual fields  
(VF) by [CONTACT_622750], including foveal and 
macular thresholds , Goldmann visual field test, and Octopus kinetic 
visual field test (for subjects whose central visual field  is >20° in at 
least 1 of the 24 meridians at  the Screening/Baseline visit using 
Goldmann perimetry III4e isopter),  as well as  central field  testing , 
reading speed, contrast sensitivity,  and color vision test ing. 
Additional efficacy endpoints will include:  microperimetry,  full-
field light sensitivity threshold  testing, and quality of life (QOL) 
questionnaire. Anatomical  structures  will be imaged  by [CONTACT_511581] (including low intensity auto fluorescence)  and by 
[CONTACT_63396].  
 
Pharmacokinetic 
Evaluations There will be no  pharmacokinetic evaluations. However, there will 
be assessment  of post -administration vector shedding (see Safety 
Evaluations, below).     
 
Safety Evaluations  This is primarily a safety study to determine whether subretinal 
administration of AAV2 -hCHM  is safe for use in subjects with 
choroideremia. Adverse event collection and c omprehensive 
laboratory safety evaluations will be conducted at regular intervals 
to assess safety. Viral vector administration may result in immune 
responses against the vector transgene product (R EP-1 protein) or 
the AAV2 capsid ; responses will be evaluated. Pregnancy outcomes 
(in female partners of subjects) will be assessed. If there is no 
limiting toxicity,  up to 15 subjects  will be entered at the two  
different dosage groups.  Safety tests will include those for the 
presence of vector in tears and blood (vector shedding).  
 
Statistical And Analytic Plan Because of the small sample size of the proposed study, the 
statistical power of the data is limited. The statistical plan will be based primarily on safety and tolerability of the vector, and 
secondarily on efficacy (see comments under ‘Safety Evaluations ’, 
above). Determining limiting toxicity will be the primary statistical 
endpoint.   
 
Data A nd Safety 
Monitoring Plan  Monitoring gene therapy studies occurs at different levels of 
regulatory oversight, by [CONTACT_622751]. The day- to-day 
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page xv 
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential   assessment of safety will be the responsibility primarily of the PI. 
An independent DSMB will oversee data and safety monitori ng, 
with interval meetings based on DSMB guidelines. Any serious 
adverse event will be reported in the appropriate time- frame to the 
Sponsor, and as required to each of the regulatory agencies (FDA, DSMB , institutional review board ( IRB) and institutional biosafety 
committee ( IBC) ).

08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
1.1.1 Choroideremia and Gene Therapy  
Choroideremia is a degenerative X-linked retinal disease characterized by [CONTACT_622752] (CHM ) gene at Xq21.2 (OMIM gene locus #300390)  resulting 
in defective or absent Rab escort protein -1 (REP-1), the protein encoded by [CONTACT_941] C HM gene 
(Seabra et al., 1993; Seabra et al ., 1995; Cremers et al ., 1994; Alexandrov et al ., 1994). 
Normally, Rab proteins are escorted by [CONTACT_622753] -1 to Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (Rab 
GGTase), which attaches geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins at the carboxy terminal ends 
(prenylation), an essential process that  activates Rab proteins for their role in intracellular 
vesicular transport  (Alexandrov et al., 1994) . In this way, R EP-1 binds to newly synthesized 
Rab proteins, presents them to Rab GGTase, an d delivers the geranylgeranylated Rab proteins 
to their target membranes.   
Absence or deficiency of R EP-1 due to deletions or mutations in the CHM  gene leads to 
cellular apoptosis and degeneration of the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836], choroid, and retinal 
photoreceptors. In normal retinas, the CHM  gene is expressed in multiple cell types, including 
retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836], photoreceptors and choroidal cells, even though there is evidence 
that the RPE cell is the primary disease -causing cell type. This evidence stems from 
observations in conditional knockout mice (Tolmachova et al.,  2006; Tolmachova et al.,  2012) 
and from studies evaluating efficacy of lentivirus -mediated gene transfer (which targets RPE 
cells pr eferentially) (Tolmachova et al.,  2012). The AAV serotype 2 vector, which targets RPE 
cells primarily (and other retinal cell types secondarily) is thus an ideal vector for 
choroideremia. Unlike lentivirus, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_622720], AAV2 
remains predominantly as a stable epi[INVESTIGATOR_622721]- term (McCarty et al.,  2004; Mingozzi 
and High, 2011). Because it is predominantly extra -chromosomal, in vivo  results indicate that 
AAV vectors  carry a low risk of insertional mutagenesis (Li et al.,  2011; Donsante et al.,  
2007). 
Clinically, choroideremia is diagnosed in affected males who manifest night blindness in 
childhood, followed by [CONTACT_622754], usually symptomatic in the 
teenage to young adult years, and eventual total blindness. The pathologic al hallmarks of this 
X-linked disease, with a population prevalence of approximately 1:50,000-1:100,000 
(Foundation Fighting Blindness, 2012; Genetics Home Reference, 2008; Orphanet, 
Choroideremia ; Weckerle, Encyclopedia of Molecular Mechanisms of Disease)  are 
degeneration of the choroicapi[INVESTIGATOR_167583], as well as retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_622717]  
(MacDonald et al., 2009) . The disease course is variable, with early clinical manifestations of 
decreased dark adaptation, progressing to decreased peripheral vision, followed eventually by [CONTACT_622740], generally occurring later in life. In some patients, blindness occurs after a prolonged course.  
Choroideremia is a disease candidate for gene transfer for the same reasons that other inherited retinal degenerative diseases are candidates  for AAV -mediated vector delivery: a) T he small 
and localized nature of the target area, namely the retina, with a radius of approximately 15 mm; b) the circumscribed environment of the target organ, the eye;  c) the tissue boundaries 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 2  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  surrounding the area to be injected , which  minimiz es exposure of other cells to the vector and 
allow s effective treatment with a relatively small vector dose; and , d) the favorable immune 
status of the eye with respect to vir al vector -mediated gene transfer (Anand et al ., 2002). 
Immune regulation processes in the eye can be so effective that antigens encountered in the eye 
potentially result in a specific tolerization known as anterior chamber -associated immune 
deviation (ACAID) (Streilein et al.,  1980).  
The justification  for a gene transfer approach for choroideremia is that a corrective gene 
delivered to the retina and RPE early enough in the clinical course may halt further 
degeneration of the RPE, retinal vasculature and phot oreceptors. If this hypothesis is correct, 
visual stability or improvement may result from gene delivery  (MacLaren et al.,  2014; Edwards 
et al., 2016) . Based on the preliminary data from  gene therapy studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_376328] U.S. and EU us ing an AAV 2-serotype vector for inherited retinal 
degeneration due to autosomal -recessive RPE65  gene mutations ( LUXTURNATM, FDA BLA  
#125610; Bainbridge et al.,  2008; Hauswirth et al.,  2008; Maguire et al.,  2008; Maguire et al.,  
2009; Simonelli et al.,  2010; Bennett et al.,  2012; Jacobson et al.,  2012; Cideciyan et al.,  2013; 
Bennett et al., 2016) , this prospect seems feasible for choroideremia.  
1.1.2  Biology of Adeno- Associated Virus (AAV) Vectors  
Adeno- associated virus is a non- enveloped, replication- defective parvovirus that has not been 
associated with human disease. AAV vectors are derived from the parent virus by [CONTACT_622755] (ITR) and inserting the gene or 
genes of interest and their associated regulatory elements  (Samulski et al.,  1982; Samulski et al.,  
1987) . The long- term safety of these vectors in humans is unknown; however, AAV vectors have 
been delivered to over [ADDRESS_829260] been remarkably free of vector -related  
adverse events  (Mingozzi and High, 2011) . In October 2012, the European Commission granted 
marketing authorization for Glybera® under exceptional circumstances as a treatment for adult 
patients diagnosed with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) confirmed by [CONTACT_622756] s uffering from severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks despi[INVESTIGATOR_286084] . 
This is the first AAV -based vector product granted marketing authorization in an ICH region , 
and is administered intramuscularly.  
AAV vectors do not require actively di viding target cells to achieve efficient transduction, as 
demonstrated in post -mitotic cells of brain, muscle, liver, and retina  in vivo  (Mingozzi and 
High, 2011; Maguire et al.,  2008; Maguire et al.,  2009). Also, at least in  animal studies, there is 
no immune response directed against the transduced cell , likely because all of the viral genes 
have been removed . In the eye, an immune -privileged site, the immune response against AAV 
capsid is negligible to weak (Anand et al., 2002), and has not precluded effective transgene 
expression following subsequent administration to the contralateral eye (Bennett et al ., 2012). 
This absence of immune response accounts, at least in part, for prolonged (months to years) 
transgene expression observed in animals following a single administration of an AAV vector. 
Several groups have established that AAV efficiently transduces retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_622722] a single administration into the subretinal space , resulting in long- term, (11 years  in 
animals, > 6 years in humans ), dose- dependent transgene expression ( Bennett et al. , 2012; 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 3  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  Cideciyan et al.,  2013).  This finding supports the anecdotal results of long- term (up to 10 
years) expression in human skeletal  muscle, targeted in earlier clinical gene transfer studies of 
hemophilia (Manno et al.,  2003; Jiang et al.,  2006; Buchlis et al., 2012).  
1.1.[ADDRESS_829261] of all , the use of an AAV2 pseudotyped vector has shown safety and utility in both 
animal models and human subjects  with autosomal- recessive RPE65  gene mutations  (Acland et 
al., 2001; Acland et al ., 2005; Maguire et al.,  2008; Bainbridge et al.,  2008; Hauswirth et al.,  
2008; Maguire et al.,  2009; Amado et al., 2010; Mingozzi and High, 2011; Bennett et al.,  
2012; Jacobson et al.,  2012; Cideciyan et al., 2013) providing impetus to develop research 
programs for other retinal degenerative diseases that have no currently effective treatment . 
Since the degenerative changes of choroideremia generally progress slowly over time, the 
results of unilateral vect or administration can be assessed and verified, when compared to the 
uninjected control eye. The subretinal space has been shown to provide a favorable 
environment for AAV to deliver a normal gene to the RPE layer  (Bennett et al.,  1999; Acland 
et al., 2001; Jacobson et al ., 2006b; Maguire et al ., 2008; Bainbridge et al.,  2008; Hauswirth et 
al., 2008; Maguire et al ., 2009; Amado et al., 2010 ), and the limited size of the target allows 
for efficient  transduction of retinal  cells. Both in vitro  and in vivo  results demonstrate that the 
REP-1 protein is translated at levels potentially sufficient to result in  a clinically relevant  
change within the eye  (see section s 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, below). Importantly, since high levels of 
the transgene protein do not appear to be toxic ( Tolmachova et al., 2012), over -expression of 
REP-[ADDRESS_829262] is AAV2 -hCHM , an adeno -associated viral  vector pseudotyped 
with AAV2 capsid, and the human CHM  gene open reading frame under the regulatory control 
of the hybrid chicken β actin (C βA) promoter/CMV enhancer upstream of C βA exon 1 and 
intron (Figure 1 ). AAV2- hCHM  is produced according to good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) 
guidelines, with substantial removal of empty capsid  particle s from the final product. The 
investigational product AAV2 -hCHM  will be administered by [CONTACT_622757], male subjects with choroideremia due to mutations in the CHM  
gene.

production and purification methods are essentially  identical for these two vectors. The sponsor 
proposes review of the safety and biodistribution results of AAV2- hRPE65v2 to help support 
the use of the identical ly encapsidated AAV2 -hCHM , for choroideremia. The RPE65 gene 
therapy data that  supports this proposed CHM clinical study is contained in FDA BLA  
#[ADDRESS_829264] been described in a number of peer -reviewed publications (Acland et al ., 
2001; Dejneka et al.,  2004; Acland et al ., 2005; Jacobson et al.,  2005; Jacobson et al ., 2006a; 
Jacobson et al., 2006b; Jacobs  et al. , 2006; Bennicelli et al., 2008; Amado et al., 2010), as 
briefly outlined in section 1.3.1 . The safety and efficacy of clinical trials using the AAV 2-
hRPE65v2 vector are described below in section 1.3.2,  including the Phase 1 clinical trial, as 
well as the follow -on study of administration to the contralateral eye . The initial results of 
AAV2 -hCHM  in cells and mice and t he results of the pharmacology/tox icology study of 
AAV2 -hCHM in non- human primates are summarized in S ection 1.4.  
1.3.1 Non-Clinical Studies  of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 
In Vitro  Studies Using  AAV2 -hRPE65  
Numerous in vitro  studies of several  iterations of AAV2 -hRPE65 vectors were conducted to 
develop the clinical vector AAV2 -hRPE65v2, for retinal disease due to RPE65  gene mutations . 
Initial studies of AAV transduction, using AAV -RPE65, of primary cell cultures of canine RPE 
cells, in which the vector was prepared, demonstrated expression of  the RPE65 protein without 
toxicity (Acland et al.,  2001). To enhance safety, AAV2-hRPE65v1 was produced, a vector 
similar to that used in the initial proof -of-concept studies, except that the plasmid used to 
generate the vector was lengthened by [CONTACT_180541] a stuffer sequence. This modification 
prevents reverse packaging from the AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), possible when the 
size of the vector plasmid backbone is less than the packaging limit of AAV. To enhance efficacy, introduction of  a Kozak sequence (Kozak, 1997) and modification of the splice 
acceptor site were performed in the d evelopment of AAV2- hRPE65v2. Importantly, AAV2-
hRPE65v2 transduction of cells in vitro  (normal and mutant Briard RPE) resulted in specific 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 6  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  expression of both hRPE65 mRNA , as detected by [CONTACT_513287] ( RT-PCR), and of RPE65 protein as detected by [CONTACT_9064]. No increase 
in the basal apoptotic rate of either normal or mutant Briard RPE cells occurred after 
transduction with AAV2- hRPE65v2 or AAV -CMV -eGFP (used as a control) at any 
multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) tested  (102 to 105). 
In Vivo  Studies Using AAV2 -Pseudotyped RPE65   
Many in vivo  studies using AAV -RPE65 as well as studies using the current version, AAV2 -
hRPE 65v2, showed favorable toxicity outcomes not only in animal models of disease but also 
in normal animals, as well as efficacy in animal models of disease.   
In Vivo  Studies Using AAV -RPE65  
Administration of AAV -RPE65 was safe and effective in a number of animal models of mice 
and dogs (Acland et al.,  2001; Dejneka et al.,  2004; Acland et al.,  2005; Jacobson et al.,  
2006b). Biodistribution studies in dogs showed little vector outside the eye (vector in the heart and diaphragm in one dog, and a single submandibular lymph node in two others , as described 
in Jacobson et al., 2006b), without germline transmission documented in any animal study. 
Subretinal injections of AAV -RPE65 (purified research -grade vector, generally containing a 
syngeneic open reading frame of RPE65), restored vision in RPE65  “knockout” mice and in 
dogs which have naturally occurring mutations in RPE65 . Importantly, transgene expression 
persisted after subretinal administration of AAV for the duration of the study and/or lifetime of animals that were treated in the laboratory, approximately 2.5 years in mice and greater than 
ten years in dogs. Age -dependent efficacy has been demonstrated in both mice and dogs, 
probably reflecting the time -course of retinal degeneration in these animal s. 
In Vivo  Studies Using AAV2 -hRPE65v1 
A non- clinical in vivo  toxicity study in normal dogs using AAV2- hRPE6 5v1 (vector plasmid 
with stuffer sequence to allow less helper plasmid contamination of final vector product), 
designed in consultation with FDA, examined histopathology and biodistribution at early (3 
week) and late (3 month) time -points. The dose utilized in this good lab practice ( GLP ) study 
(1.5x10
12 vg/eye) was 100- fold higher than the RPE65 Phase [ADDRESS_829265] 
and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (see next section, below).  
In Vivo  Studies Using AAV2 -hRPE65v2  
To summarize, following injection of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 prepared by [CONTACT_622758] 
a dose of 8.25x10
10 vg/eye (5.5-fold greater than the low dose of the RPE65 human trial  and 
nearly two-fold greater than the proposed low dose of the CHM human trial ), affected dogs 
showed improvement in visual parameters, and in marked contrast to dogs injected in the study 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 7  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  described above, showed only mild focal retinal toxicity. There was no evidence of systemic 
exposure to RPE65 protein at 5 weeks or 3 months after treatment. Antibodies to AAV2 capsid  
were detected at 5 weeks, but were not observed 3 months after treatment. Also, there was minimal evidence of RPE65 protein in ganglion cells and in optic nerves and photoreceptors 
(Bennicelli et al., 2008). Importantly, in a follow -up study in Briard (affected) dogs, sequential 
administration of 1.5x10
11 vg AAV2 -hRPE65v2 to one eye then the contralateral eye was well 
tolerated and resulted in improvements in visual behavior in the animals (Amado et al.,  2010). 
Additional non- clinical studies were conducted to address the focal toxicity observed in the 
canine study using AAV2- hRPE65v1 at the three -month time -point (noted above) and to 
examine safety issues with respect to slight modifications that were made to the vector sequence and formulation. The changes, which were made to optim ize the delivery and 
performance of the vector, are detailed ( Bennicelli et al.,  2008). Modifications included 
installation of a Kozak sequence at the translation start site of hRPE65 and modification of the 
splice acceptor site. Following detailed studies  to assess possible loss and/or inactivation of 
vector using delivery devices, the concentration of Lutrol
® F68 (also known as Pluronic F68 
and Poloxamer 188)  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_622723] 0.0001% to 0.001% (Bennicelli et al.,  2008). 
The following non- clinical toxicology studies were performed to evaluate safety and efficacy 
of the modified vector and formulation.  
AAV2 -hRPE65v2 Toxicology Study in Non -Human Primates  
To evaluate the safety of AAV2 -hRPE65v2, the vector construct used in the RPE65  
clinical study, a non- clinical toxicology study examined late time -points in non-human 
primates (NHPs). The doses utilized in this study (3x1011 vg and 7.5x1011 vg) are two -fold and 
five- fold higher than the high dose of the RPE65 Phase [ADDRESS_829266] that dog eyes show much higher amounts of inflammation a fter surgical procedures 
than those of primates and other animals (Acland et al., 2005); further, eyes of NHPs are more similar to those of humans than are dog eyes, as primates are the only animals that have a 
macula. Since there is only one amino acid difference between the RPE65 protein of humans 
and non- human primates , whereas there are eight differences between humans and dogs, it 
seemed less likely that the human RPE65 protein would be viewed as a foreign antigen in NHPs than in dogs. For both anatomical and immunological reasons, NHPs provide a more appropriate model.  
Ten non- human primate eyes (5 animals) were injected at doses of 20 -fold (4 eyes, 3x10
11 vg 
per eye) and 50-fold (4 eyes; 7.5x1011 vg per eye) of the AAV2 -hRPE65v2 human low dose of 
1.5x1010 vg; two eyes were injected with vehicle alone. Final evaluations included ocular 
histopathology and biodistribution. Most eyes showed no inflammation. No retinal 
degeneration was apparent in any eye after necropsy by [CONTACT_26745], as had been observed 
in the canine toxicology study at the same time -point. This three -month non- clinical study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated no ocular toxicity resulting from a single subretinal injection of vehicle alone or AAV2- hRPE65v2 at 20- or 50-fold the human low dose and 2- or 
5-fold the human high dose.  
There was no mortality during the study. No test article -related clinical signs of systemic 
toxicity occurred. There were predicted effects of the surgery on ocular examination, including 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 8  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  mild and reversible inflammatory responses following surgery and alterations in the appearance 
of the retinal fundus due to subretinal injection. In two NHP eyes injected with AAV2-
hRPE65v2, at the far periphery of the retina there was mild perivascular cuffing directed 
toward  the vitreous and some inflammatory cells in the vitreous near the optic disc; the changes 
were minor in comparison to the focal toxicity observed in the normal dogs at the 1.5x1012 vg 
dose ( 100-fold higher than the RPE65 Phase 1 low dose and 10- fold higher than the RPE65 
Phase 1 high dose ). There were additional findings that were expected from the subretinal 
injection (dislodged and hypertrophic RPE cells), but no inflammation was observed in the 
subretinal space at either dose tested. At necropsy, there were two unexpected findings: 1) one 
animal had some nodules in its large intestine; and 2) another animal had a few adhesions 
between the diaphragm and the lung. The Sponsor believes that these findings were unrelated 
to the test article. The minimal toxicity observed in this study may reflect the lower dose 
utilized in the NHP study, or may have resulted from the greater sequence conservation  
between humans and NHP RPE65 as compared to canine RPE65.  
There was no evidence of vector spread to pancreas, lung, bone marrow, kidney, testes/ovaries, 
brain, diaphragm, systemic lymph nodes, bone, thymus, heart, urinary bladder, stomach 
(cardiac, fundic and pyloric), colon, skeletal muscle, skin. As expected, intra -ocular fluids 
(anterior chamber fluid and vitreous) of all test article -injected eyes were strongly positive for 
presence of test article at the three- month time -point. Optic nerves (and optic chiasms) of the 
exposed eyes were often weakly positive for test article; this is likely a consequence of exposure to retinal ganglion cells, which line the inner surface of the retina and whose axons 
make up the optic nerve. These results are also in agreement with biodistribution results from 
non-clinical canine toxicology studies.  An unexpected finding was that samples from spleen, 
and to a lesser extent liver, were mildly positive for the test article. The strength of the signal was related to dose, with weak or no signal identified at the lower dose. The non- clinical 
investigator s speculate that this is due to migration of immune cells that might have engulfed 
vector or cells exposed to vector to these organs. The animals showed no significant humoral antibody response or cell -mediated immunological responses to the test agent.  
Similarly,  bilateral  sequential administration of 1.5x10
11 vg AAV2 -hRPE65v2 was well 
tolerated in unaffected non- human primates (NHPs) that had been previously systemically 
exposed to AAV. Those animals showed increases in serum immunoreactivity to AAV2 aft er 
subretinal injection. This did not prevent safe administration to the contralateral eyes. There 
was also an increase in antibodies directed toward the AAV2 capsids in the anterior chamber 
fluid of the injected eye (only) after unilateral injection. Again, this had no effect on the ability to administer the AAV2 safely to the contralateral eye (Amado et al.,  2010). 
In summary, simultaneous bilateral administration of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 was well tolerated 
both in RPE65  mutant dogs and in normal sighted monkeys,  even at doses that are higher than 
those used to date in humans enrolled in the RPE65 Phase 1 study (Bennicelli et al.,  2008; 
Amado et al.,  2010 ). In addition, bilateral sequential subretinal administrations were well 
tolerated in dogs and monkeys, even if subsequent injections were carried out several months 
after the first one (Amado et al.,  2010).

10 vg indicated no clinical significant effects 
from detachment of the fovea and subretinal vector administration and no vector -related 
toxicity (MacLaren et al ., 2014). Two patients who had low baseline best corrected visual 
acuity showed gain of letters with the treated eyes six months after vector administration and the retinal sensitivity in the treated eyes in all patients was correlated with the vector dose 
administered per mm
2 of surviving retina. This early improvement was sustained at 3.5 years 
after vector administration ( Edwards et al., 2016).  In 2018, a randomized, open label, and 
parallel  controlled phase 3 trial ( www.clinicaltrials.gov  NCT 03496012) was initiated in United 
States, Canada, Finland, [LOCATION_013], Netherlands, and [LOCATION_008].  
Summary of human studies using AAV2 -hRPE65v2 
While there is limited reports of clinical trial data of AAV vector mediated gene delivery for 
choroideremia (MacLaren et al ., 2014; Edwards et al ., 2016), there are considerable data for 
RPE65 using AAV2. Two P hase 1 studies were conducted f or AAV2 -hRPE65v2, a Phase 1 
study (101) and a Phase 1 foll ow-on study (102), involving the same twelve study participants . 
AAV2 -hRPE65v2 was initially tested in a Phase 1, first -in-human, open- label, dose escalation 
safety study of patients with inherited retinal dystrophy due to autosomal recessive RPE65  
gene mutations. The primary objective of the 101 study was to determine the safety and 
tolerability of gene transfer by [CONTACT_622759]2- hRPE65v2; a secondary 
objective was to assess both the objective and subjective clinical measures of efficacy in patients with RPE65  gene mutations. Eleven of twelve subjects from the 101 study were 
transferred to the 102 study to receive the same vector administration to the contralateral eye in 
the 101 s tudy; one additional subject who participated in the 101 study was not eligible for the 
102 study . As such, enrollment for the study was closed 
in 2013. The primary objective of the 102 study was to assess the safety and tolerability of non-
simultaneous, bilateral subretinal administration of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 (administration to the 
contralateral eye). The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of administration of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 to the contralateral eye, using pre -injection measurements of the eye injected 
as a control. At the time of initiation of the [ADDRESS_829268] their Year One 101 study visit.  A Phase 3, randomized controlled (301) study of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 
enrolled twenty- nine par ticipants with all intervention subjects received non-simultaneous, 
bilateral administration of AAV2 -hRPE65v2. The objectives of the [ADDRESS_829269] one year from the baseline evaluations, nine control participants were able to cross over to 
receive administration of AAV2 -hRPE65v2. There were no serious adverse events related to 
AAV2 -hRPE65v2 and no deleterious immune responses observed in the Phase 3 trial, or in the

1.4 Non-Clinical Studies of AAV2 -hCHM   
1.4.1 In Vitro  Pharmacology of AAV2 -hCHM  
Due to the lack of an  animal model of CHM  that mimics the human disease , in vitro  models of 
the disease were developed for pharmacology studies  (Vasireddy et al.,  2013) . Two induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines (CPS1 and CPS2) were generated from two unrelated 
individuals with confirmed CHM  gene mutations. The loss of REP -[ADDRESS_829271] cell line was subsequently generated from CPS1 and was named CPF1. These cell lines were used to evaluate the AAV2 -hCHM vector 
for its ability to confer REP -1 activity.  
Choroiderem ia patient -derived induced pluripotent stem cells were then transduced with 
AAV2 -hCHM at MOIs of  1x10
2, 1x103, 1x104, 1x105, or 2x105 vg/cell. Wild type induced 
pluripotent stem cells were also plated, but not transduced, and used as a control for normal 
REP-1 expression levels. Expression of REP -1 was evaluated by [CONTACT_622761] -
REP-1 antibody. A qualitative comparison between untransduced wild type cells and CHM 
cells transduced with AAV2 -hCHM at an MOI of 1x105 showed similar levels of REP -1 
expression. Transduction of all three cell types (CPS1, CPS2 and CPF1) with AAV2- hCHM at 
an MOI of 2x105 vg/cell resulted in the expression of REP -1 protein (Vasireddy et al.,  2013) , 
which was primarily localized to the cytoplasm. Additional studies were performed to determine if the REP -[ADDRESS_829272] -translational lipid modification of Rab small GTPases 
(Rabs), a process called prenylation. In addition, REP -1 is required for escort of prenylated Rab 
proteins to their target membranes. Thus, to assess the biological activity of REP -1 expressed 
from AAV2 -hCHM,  assays were employed to determine if Rab proteins were prenylated and 
subsequently escort ed to the cell membrane. When CPF1, CPS1 and CPS2 cells  were 
transduced with AAV2- hCHM at an MOI of 2x10
5, the REP -1 protein was capable of 
prenylating its substrate (Rab27) and the amount of Rab27 associated with the cell membrane  
was similar to that seen  in unaffected normal cells  (Vasireddy et al.,  2013) . To screen for short -
term toxicity resulting from transduction with AAV2 -hCHM, CHO cells were evaluated for 
apoptosis by [CONTACT_622762]2- hCHM at MOIs of 1x105 or 
2x105. Neither  dose of AAV2 -hCHM resulted in cell death in the CHO cells. These studies 
demonstrate that AAV2 -hCHM is capable of safely d elivering a biologically active  REP-[ADDRESS_829273]  
the human condition accurately and currently no other small or large animal models  with 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 11  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  choroideremia- like disease have been identified. Thus, the safety of delivering AAV2- hCHM 
to the subretinal space was evaluated in normal wild -type mice and NHPs.   
Safety in Normal Mice 
To evaluate the safety of in vivo  expression of AAV2- hCHM, wild  type mice were injected 
subretinally with the recombinant adeno- associated viral vectors ( rAAV) at a dose of 2.7x1010 
vg/retina. Three weeks post -injection, retinal tissues were collected for protein analysis and 
histologic analyses. Immunoblot analysis of  the retinal tissue from these animals confirmed the 
presence of REP -[ADDRESS_829274] demonstrated that after subretinal 
injection, the CHM  transgene is expressed in both RPE cells and in photoreceptors and no 
toxicity was observed (Vasireddy et al.,  2013). 
In summary, delivery of AAV2- hCHM results in the expression of REP -1 in CHO and patient -
derived iPS cells in vitro , and delivery to retinal cells in vivo  results in no  significant evidence 
of toxicity. The non- clinical data indicate that the REP-1 expressed from AAV2 in patient -
derived iPS cells is able to prenylate its substrate and restore significant trafficking of Rab27 
protein to the surface of the cell . 
Safety in Non -Human Primates  
A toxicology study was designed with assistance of FDA CBER representatives at a pre -IND 
meeting held March 11, 2013. The study was designed to include twelve (12) male non-human 
primates (NHP, Macaca fascicularis, Cynomolgus monkeys) fo r injection of either vehicle or 
AAV2 -hCHM at two different doses and two routes of administration. GMP -process 
comparable AAV2 -hCHM vector or vehicle was injected using the same volume 
(approximately 300 µL per retina), as well as the same  injection device proposed for the 
clinical study. Each animal was injected  bilaterally with either vehicle or vector. The material 
injected included: (a) Vehicle alone subretinally into each eye of  two NHPs; (b) AAV2 -hCHM 
at 3x 1011 vg subretinally into each eye in four NHPs (a dose which is 6-fold greater than the 
proposed starting Dose  Group 1 for the human CHM trial, and 3-fold greater than that of Dose 
Group 2 of the human CHM trial; (c) AAV2 -hCHM at 7.5x1011 vg per retina, into each eye in 
four NHPs (a dose which is 15-fold greater than the proposed starting Dose Group 1 for the 
human CHM trial, and 7.5-fold greater than that of Dose Group 2 of the human CHM trial; and 
(d) AAV2 -hCHM at 7.5x1011 vg into each eye injected intravitreally in two NHPs, to provide a 
”worst c ase scenario’ for the complications of injection. Half of the animals in each group were 
sacrificed at [ADDRESS_829275] -injection.  
After ocular injections and peri -operative administration of sub- conjunctival triamcinolone and 
ophthalmic prednisone and gentamicin, animals were followed for in- life observations and 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 12  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  blood tests. Blood tests included complete blood counts  (CBCs) , serum chemistries, and seru m 
for immunological parameters (humoral and cellular immune responses against AAV2 and 
antibodies against hREP -1). Tissue histopathology, including ocular histopathology, was 
performed upon sacrifice.  
There were no clinical observations attributed to administration of the test article. There were 
no definitive test article -related changes in hematology parameters or in serum chemistries. 
Immunological testing of serum fo r anti -AAV humoral activity was  as expected, showing 
elevations of anti -AAV2 antibodies in all but one animal receiving AAV2- hCHM ; however, no 
cellular immun e responses against AAV2 capsid were detected at any time points evaluated. A 
possible low -level antibody response directed against REP -[ADDRESS_829276] article -related 
systemic toxicities were noted following a single subretinal or  intravitreal injection of AAV2 -
hCHM to Cynomolgus monkeys following either a 21- day or 91- day recovery period.  
Ophthalmologic evaluations revealed that in the large majority of animals the subretinal 
injection caused large retinal bullae that resolved over the course of the study leaving focal 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_622724]/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_622725].  
Histopathological examination of the eyes  in this study, including those that received vehicle, 
demonstrated cha nges in the RPE associated with the location of the subretinal injection site. 
Inflammation appeared to be a dose and time dependent phenomenon in most cases, but in all eyes that exhibited inflammation , it was graded as no worse than mild. Structural chan ges in 
the photoreceptors were only identified in two of four eyes injected with the high dose of 
vector and sacrificed at  Day 91. These changes were mild and focal in nature, not affecting the 
entirety of the retina.  
The investigative team is not certain  if the mild focal loss of photoreceptors observed in two of 
four eyes injected with the high dose of AAV2- hCHM and sacrificed at day 91 was due to 
complications of the subretinal injection, the AAV2 capsid, or expression of human REP -1 in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Since similar and higher doses of AAV2-hRPE65v2 did not lead to 
photoreceptor loss when injected into the eyes of this same species of monkeys, this finding is 
not likely due to the AAV2 capsid.  However, it is possible that it could be due to expression of 
a foreign transgene, as there are 18 amino acid differences between the human and cynomolgus REP-1 proteins, while there is only a single amino acid difference between the human and 
cynomolgus hRPE65 proteins. Thus , it is more likely that the hR EP-1 protein will be viewed as 
a foreign antigen than hRPE65.  
In the Phase 1 /[ADDRESS_829277] is less likely. The 
investigative team believes the results obtained in the NHP study support the use of two dose 
levels in the proposed Phase 1/2  clinical trial, namely  5x10
10 vg/eye and 1x1011 vg/eye.  
In a separate NHP study, one cynomolgus monkey for each of the dose groups (5x1011, 
7.5x1011, and 2x1012 vg per eye) received AAV2 -hCHM via bilateral subre tinal injections 
(Couto, 2016 A RVO Meeting; Ignatova, [ADDRESS_829278] Meeting). Retinal tissues from the

given dose group (study- wide) and at least [ADDRESS_829279] ed in study participation , he will be 
invited to consent for the gene therapy study. The gene therapy  Screening/ Baseline evaluations 
are comprehensive, and will consist of the review of all relevant medical records and tests 
required to determine study eligibility , including obtaining CLIA -certified laboratory 
confirmation of CHM genotype (if not done previously) . If the subject is found eligible for the 
study and interested in pursuing the intervention phase, the subject will be scheduled for vector 
administration  conducted under general anesthesia. The s urgical procedure for this proposed 
study is similar to  that conducted in the Phase 1  and Phase 3 studies  of AAV2 -hRPE65v2 
(FDA BLA  #125610, LUXTURNA
TM) and is described in the Manual of Procedures .   
As is always the case with subretinal injection, the operating surgeon has latitude in 
administration of the dose, based on the pathophysiology of the subject’s retina. In 
choroideremia in particular, it is anticipated that some patients will have limited access for 
injection due to degenerative disease. For this reason , all doses are specified as “up to 300 µ L,” 
recognizing that some subjects may receive a smaller total subre tinal volume than 300 µL, and 
as such, may not receive the total dose . This information will be captured should this occur.    
Following unilateral vector administration  under general anesthesia, the subjects will be 
followed up comprehensively for safety and efficacy endpoints for two years  after injection , 
then up to an additional 3 years (total of up to 5 years) of long- term follow -up. Based on the 
pathophysiology of choroider emia, the investigative team does not anticipate  the nearly 
immediate improvement of light sensitivity, to the extent that  resulted for the RPE65 gene 
therapy studies  (Maguire et al.,  2008; Maguire et al.,  2009; Bennett et al.,  2012). Additionally, 
the visual deterioration of choroideremia generally progresses more  slowly than that associated 
with autosomal -recessive RPE65  gene mutations  (Rosenberg & Schwartz, 1994; Roberts et al.,  
2002). The slower decline of visual function of choroideremia mean s that the use of  the 
uninjected eye as a control for the injected eye  becomes more statistically significant as 
sufficient  time lapses between injections. Therefore, to minimize risk to subjects, 
administration of investigational product will be done in one eye for this study.          
3.1.1 Screening /Baseline   
Potential subjects will be referred from health professionals who care for patients with 
choroideremia , from clinics of investigative team members, from vision centers as well as 
potential self-referred subjects , and from the website posting on clinicaltrials.gov. For those 
patients who are interested, i nvestigative team members will describe the clinical trial to the 
subject, using the IRB-approved study consent and other approved recruitment materials as 
educational tool s. If the available clinical information indicates potential eligibility, and the

If results of the Screening/ Baseline evaluations indicate  eligibility, and the subject agrees to 
study entry, vector (the investigational product ) administration will be scheduled. O n the day of 
surgery, vital signs, chemistry,  hematology, and urinalysis, will be performed, along with 
specimen collection for vector shedding (Section 4.2. 1). If the anesthesia consult clears the 
subject for general anesthesia, the subject will proceed with  vector  administration under 
general anest hesia (Section 4.2. 1). After  vector administration  (study intervention) , there are 
regularly scheduled post- administration tests scheduled over a two-year interval to assess both 
safety and efficacy (Section 4.2. 2), as well as  for an additional  up to 3 years, for a total of up  to 
5 years LTFU  following vector administration (Section 4.5) . Pregnancy outcomes will be 
collected after female partners of subjects consent and authorize collection  of medical 
information. Subjects are encouraged to inform the Investigators as soon as a pregnancy occurs 
and when the outcome of the pregnancy is known.  
The subject’s non- preferred eye, or the eye  with worse visual acuity if the subject has no 
preference,  will be the one receiving the vector administration  at the time of surgery . This 
would allow  subjects to preserve the better eye in the event that the study product or procedures 
result in further visual deterioration. In patients with choroideremia, the visual function of each 
eye generally parallels that of the contralateral eye.

Each of these tests is either a standard clinical test done according to standard clinical practice 
or performed b y the investigative  team  according to Sponsor SOP .  
Visual Acuity : Visual acuity measures will document any change in central vision, the ability 
to resolve standard optotype images presented as optotypes/letters corresponding to different 
visual angles, i.e.,  image size. This testing will use ETDRS charts. The level of central visual 
resolution is converted to a visual minimal angle of resolution score (LogMAR) for comparison 
purposes.  
Visual Field Tests : Visual field parameters will evaluate alterations in function of different 
regions of the retina; kinetic fields will be measured with Goldmann ( III4e isopter ), and 
Humphrey static fields with computerized testing , including foveal and macular thresholds, and 
a central field. In addition, Octopus kinetic  perimetry will be done t o subjects whose central

08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  visual field is >20° in at least 1 of the 24 meridians  at Screening/Baseline visit  using Goldmann 
perimetry III4e isopter . 
Reading speed : The reading speed test will require subjects to read designated word charts with 
black letters on a white background aloud and subsequently, the critical print size and optimal 
reading speed will be calculated.  
 
Contrast Sensitivity : Contrast sensitivity will measure the subject’s ability to discern targets 
presented at varying levels of contrast.  
Color Vision Test : Color vision testing will be conducted if the subjects are able to perceive the 
test objects.  
 
Microperimetry : Microperimetry  will be conducted in the dark- adapted state to evaluate 
maximal retinal sensitivity. Microperimetry measurements of the injected  eyes will also be 
compared to the control (uninjected) eyes.  Microperimetry will measure minimal detectable 
stimulus, mean sen sitivity , and visual field size.  
 
Full- field Light  Sensitivity Threshold Testing: Full- field light sensitivity threshold (FST) 
testing measures the light sensitivity of the entire visual field by [CONTACT_622767] a subject reports seeing the dimmest flash. The test is carried out on subjects with dilated 
eyes in a dark -adapted state; subjects are seated in front of a Ganzfeld dome in which the light 
flashes are generated. The light sensitivity of each eye is measured separately by [CONTACT_622768]  (and then the other). A sound is generated at the time of the light  flash 
and the subject presses one button when they see a flash or a second button if they do not see a flash. Flashes of varying luminance (in a range spanning ~80 dB) are presented in a 
randomized order , except that the series starts with dim flashes. From this data, an algorithm 
calculates the minimum luminance (for each eye) at which the subject perceives light.  
Fundus Photography: Fundoscopy will be performed with indirect ophthalmoscopic exam and 
fundus biomicroscopy. Photographs will be taken with a fundus camera following standard 
clinical methods.  
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) : OCT captures micrometer -resolution, three -dimensional 
images from within optical scattering media ( e.g., retinal tissue ). The Heidelberg Spectralis 
OCT machine will be u sed. Optical coherence tomography is an interferometric technique, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_622726] -infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to 
penetrate into the scattering medium, providing important images, including the thickness of 
the retina.  
Quality of Life questionnaire : The Investigators will use a QOL questionnaire relevant to the 
subject population.

the investigational product  from the investigational pharmacy  for administration to a study 
subject, a Pharmacy  Order Form shall be completed and signed by a Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622727]- Investigator. This  form is to be completed on a subject -by-subject basis; the 
Investigators should complete and initial  the date and time section. Upon receiving the order 
form, the investigational pharmacy will prepare the investigational product  as follows:   
Universal precautions and appropriate personal protective equipment will be used by 
[CONTACT_622769]. The frozen AAV2-hCHM  and 
diluent vials shall be thawed at room temperature and gently mixed. Appropriate volumes of 
the AAV2 -hCHM and diluent products, both provided by [CONTACT_1034] , will then be combined 
using aseptic techniques in a biosafety cabinet. The Sponsor ’s instructions for this procedure , 
including the specific  volumes of AAV2 -hCHM  and diluent to combine, will accompany each 
individual lot of  material delivered to the investigational pharmacy.

(Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_12201]).   
7.3 Dosing  
The two doses of AAV2 -hCHM  proposed for this study are: Up to 5x1010 vg per eye ( Dose 
Group 1) and up to 1x1011 vg per eye  (Dose Group 2). Dosing was  based on several 
considerations. In vitro non- clinical data demonstrat ed robust R EP-1 protein levels  and 
normalization of prenylation activity as well as restoration of Rab27 intravesicular transport to 
the cell membrane (see section 1.4.1)  at doses comparable to those used in the RPE65  non-
clinical studies, without toxicity in mice (Vasireddy et al.,  2013) . Additionally,  the data from 
the prior P hase 1, the Phase 1 follow-on, and the P hase 3 stud ies for RPE65  mutations  support 
safety in the dose range of 1.5x1010 to 1.5x1011 vg/eye. Because choroideremia results in 
progressive death of peripheral retina, some subjects enrolled in this study may not have 
enough viable retina to tolerate an injection volume of [ADDRESS_829305] dose administered . The study in the [LOCATION_006] of an AAV2 vector delivering R EP-
1 via an AAV2 vector  to patients with choroideremia also supports the proposed doses . The 
[LOCATION_006] starting dose wa s 1x1010 vg/eye in [ADDRESS_829306] retinal cells  
(MacLaren et al.,  2014) ; this study has progressed to a dose of 1x1011 vg/eye, with no reports 
of vector -related toxicity  (MacLaren, Choroideremia Research Foundation M eeting, June 15-
17, 2014, Denver ).  
Subjects who enroll and are eligible but not injected may  be replaced with another eligible 
subject to achieve up to [ADDRESS_829307]-

dosage groups , it is anticipated that a  total of 15 evaluable, injected  subjects will be entered on 
study. 
7.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_622729], with added assessments pertaining to 
ocular AEs (located in the Manual of Procedures ). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined 
as any irreversible Grade [ADDRESS_829308] at the same (or higher) grade for more than seven days; r eversible toxicities are those 
resolving in seven or fewer days.  
If DLT is experienced, further subject enrollment will be delayed pending consultation with  the 
DSMB. If a subject  experiences any DLT , the DSMB will assist in determining whether 
additional subjects should be enrolled at the same dose level , or at a lower dose level . If two 
subjects of a dose group develop limiting toxicity , possibly or probably attributable to the 
vector, the maxim um tolerated dose (MTD) will have been reached . In the event  this occurs in 
Dose Group 2, additional subjects may  be enrolled to the group just below the MTD , i.e. Dose 
Group 1.   
If a single occurrence of Grade 4 toxicity, excluding toxicities covered under the category “General”, or death of a subject occurs and is deemed possibly or probably related to the 
AAV2 -hCHM , the Sponsor will halt enrollment and notify the DSMB and FDA . Further 
enrollment and/or vector administrations will be conducted only after FDA and the Sponsor  
confer  to determine that the IND is not on clinical hold, and the DSMB agrees to continue 
enrollment. Study visits for subjects that have already received AAV2- hCHM will continue per 
protocol. 
The Sponsor or designee will report a ll SAEs and AEs to the DSMB, FDA, NIH OBA , and to 
Principal Investigators (who will in turn notify the IRBs/ Institutional Ethics Committees ( IECs ) 
of record ) within the required reporting timeframes. In addition to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_622730] t he toxicity criteria table ( located in the Manual of Procedures ), the

8  SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be monitored throughout the active and long- term follow -up phase  
following vector administration. A dverse event  inquiry and assessment will be conducted on an 
ongoing basis during study participation through the following means:  
• Subject inquiry or report  
• Physical observation and/or physical examination  
• Laboratory and any other diagnostic test results review  
• Telephone call  
• E-mail 
• Postal query 
The toxicity  reporting scale ( located in the Manual of Procedures ) should be used, when 
possible, to assess adverse events . 
8.[ADDRESS_829310]’s baseline 
assessments and clinical course, an d not known to be part of another AE diagnosis.  As per 
regulatory guidelines, pre -existing conditions, including abnormal lab values manifest at 
baseline testing, will only be reported as adverse events if the condition worsens in severity and/or frequency.  
The Investigators will follow an AE until the event is either resolved or assessed as stable.  
The Investigator s are responsible for notifying the Sponsor representative or designee and the 
IRB of all AEs and other unanticipat ed problems related to research. Unanticipated problems 
are other types of incidents, experiences, and outcomes that occur during the conduct of human 
subject research that are not considered adverse events. For example, some unanticipated 
problems involve  social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm 
associated with adverse events. In other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others 
at increased risk  of harm, but no harm occurs.    
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 35  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  The Sponsor or designee will notify the appropriate federal regulatory authorities  (FDA, NIH 
OBA, DSMB). Events that do not require expedited reporting  will be summarized at the time 
of continuing review / annual re port.  
 
8.3 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned clinical event in the form of 
signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a subject 
participating in a clinical study with the Sponsor's investigational product , regardless of causal 
relationship.  Adverse events will include any conditions that : 1) were not present prior to 
investigational product  administration,  but appeared following investigational product  
administration; or 2) were present prior to investigational product  administration,  but worsened 
in severity and/or frequency following investigational product  administration . 
Adverse events will be noted in the study records and on the case report form with a full description including the nature, date of onset (as well as time, if feasible), determination of 
non-serious versus serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, death ), duration 
(i.e. end date and time, if feasible), causality, and outcome of the event.  
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
intervention and the adverse eve nt. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the event. Inherent in this definition, and in the requirement to report them is the 
need for the sponsor to evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the 
likelihood that the drug actually caused the adverse event.  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpec ted if it is not listed in the I nvestigator’s B rochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.    
8.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE  or SAR  is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening event (its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death);  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 36

• The prescheduled, or elective procedure, or routinely scheduled treatment w as scheduled 
(or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to 
participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled, or  elective procedure, or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and the time of the 
procedure or treatment. The prescheduled, or elective procedure, or routinely scheduled 
treatment is the sole reason for th e intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe events or reactions. A severe 
AE/SAR  is a major event of its type. A severe AE /SAR  does not necessarily need to be 
considered serious. For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but would not be considered serious. On the other hand, a stroke that results in 
only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be considered 
serious.

The I nvestigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_622732] , investigational product, and study measures  using the criteria 
outlined below. Relationship to the administration procedure should also be note d.  
Relationship Description  
Unlikely to 
be related  AEs which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are 
judged to be unrelated to the investigational material because:  
a) AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence or known pattern of response 
after administration of the in vestigational material  
b) AE could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
Possibly related  
 AEs for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a 
connection with the investigational material appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty, because at least one of the following criteria are met:  
a) AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence or known pattern of response after administration of investigational material.  
b) AE could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state, toxic or environmental factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.   
Probably related  AEs which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt 
with a high degree of certainty to be related to the investigational material, because the following criteria are met:  
a) AE  cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_395034];  
and at least one of the following is true:  
b) AE  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investiga tional new drug and/or administration procedure;  
c) AE  follows a known pattern of response to the investigational new drug or 
administration procedure;  
d) AE disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in activity of the 
investigational new drug; or  
e) AE reappears upon re -challenge or re- administration of the investigational new 
drug. 
Investigators are responsible for reporting SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions ( i.e., S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to their respective Independent Reviewing Authorities (IRAs; may

than as individual signs or symptoms.  If a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the 
individual signs and symptoms should be recorded.  
• If an AE requires a surgical or diagnostic procedure, the illness leading to the 
procedure should be recorded as the AE, not the procedure itself.  
For SAEs, t he initial notification  should include all available infor mation requested on the SAE 
Form; the initial notification  must be followed by [CONTACT_424445], which includes all 
information  including causality assessment from the Principle Investigator . The SAE Form will 
collect data surrounding the event, e.g.,  the nature of the symptom(s), time of onset in relation 
to initiation of investigational product, duration, severity, and whether or not treatment was 
administered for the symptoms experienced. The I nvestigator’s assessment of the probable 
cause of the ev ent will also be included.  A physician will examine subjects who experience a n 
SAE or a  medical  emergency situation as soon as possible. The physician in attendance will do 
whatever is medically necessary for the safety and well -being of the subject. The s ubject will 
remain under observation as long as medically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. 
Appropriate lab studies will be conducted until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise 
explained. The SAE will be followed until resolved or until medically stabilized. In a medical 
emergency requiring immediate attention, study site staff will provide appropriate medical 
care, according to current standards of care.  The Investigator or his/her designee should 
contact [CONTACT_622771] . The Sponsor or designee will notify the 
appropriate federal regulatory authorities.  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report, a follow -up report including all 
relevant new or reassessed information ( e.g., concomitant med ication, medical history) should 
be submitted to the Sponsor or designee. All SAEs should be followed until either resolved or 
stable. The Medical Monitor and the independent DSMB will review all AEs .

9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
9.1 Dose Group Assignment Methods  
This is a n open- label, non- randomized, non- blinded inter -group dose escalation safety and 
tolerability study of AAV2 -hCHM , administered unilaterally by  [CONTACT_622772] . Barring toxicity, subjects will be sequentially entered to D ose Group 1 , then Dose 
Group 2.    
9.2 Data Collection and Management  
Complete and accurate records are essential for the performance of a clinical trial and accurate 
interpretation of its results . These records will  be maintained in a secure area with limited 
access, but will b e available and attainable for audits as required by [CONTACT_1032], local, or 
institutional regulatory agencies. All trial registration documents will be obtained and pass a 
compliance review before shipment of investigational drug to a study site will  be authorized by 
[CONTACT_1034] .  
The investigative team is responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all relevant study documentation including:  
• Case report forms  
• Subject source document files  
• Monitoring logs  
• Registratio n documents (including Clinical Protocol and Investigator’s B rochure, 
curriculum vitae of participating I nvestigators, IRB correspondence, signed 1572)  
• Drug accountability records  
Data will be entered  from subject source documents to Case Report Forms that are speciall y 
designed for this study. The I nvestigators are responsible for accurate completion of these 
forms for all subjects who receive AAV2 -hCHM  in the study. These forms are an integral part 
of the study and must be completed.

institutional policies and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) on 
subject privacy. Investigators and other site personnel will not use the data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study. Study subjects should be identified on Case Report 
Forms by [CONTACT_5056], not by [CONTACT_180530], to protect subject privacy. The I nvestigators 
will kee p a separate log of subject names and addresses in a locked cabinet and/or on a separate 
computer as a password protected file. However, in compliance with FDA Good Clinical 
Practice regulations, the study monitor may review that portion of the subject's m edical record 
that is directly related to the study.  
All trial Essential Documents  will be retained in the study site file s for a minimum of two years 
after the date of approval for commercial license of a biologic, device, or drug, last approval of a mar keting application in an ICH region, until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region, or until at least two years have elapsed since the formal

administration and/or clinical follow -up evaluations,  will be instructed in Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) Guidelines and clinical protocol requirements.  
An independent DSMB will be established. This board will provide oversight and monitoring of the conduct of the trial to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of 
the data. Members of the DSMB will include clinicians, scientists, and public representatives. 
These individuals will be selected on the basis of their experience, knowledge of clinical trial 
methodology, and absence of conflicts of interest. The DSMB will review and approve the 
research protocols and detailed plans for data and safety monitoring. It will establish specific 
guidelines for monitoring for safety and review interim outcome data for safety and efficacy. 
The DSMB  will also review trial performance information such as subject recruitment and 
retention, clinical site performance, and proposals for ancillary studies. It will also review published reports of related studies to determine whether this study needs to be changed or 
terminated. DSMB meetings, in person or by [CONTACT_577], will occur no less frequently than

DSMB will provide the study leaders with written recommen dations related to continuing, 
changing, or terminating the trial.  
Prior to implementation, any amendments to the protocol that have subject safety implications 
must be approved by [CONTACT_553712], and submitted to the IND on file with FDA. 
Measures that  are critical for subject safety may be implemented simultaneously with reporting 
to the IRB, DSMB, and FDA. Any manuscript, abstract, or presentation will be available to all the Investigators involved in this study, as well as the DSMB as described above , for review 
prior to submission.  
9.4.2 Risk Assessment
 
Clinical experience of gene therapy for the eye has been based  on AAV gene delivery for 
RPE65  mutations , using the AAV2- hRPE65v2 vector. Possible adverse events for subjects 
enrolled in this study include : risks associated with the administration procedure ( subretinal 
delivery ) and risks associated with the investigational material ( AAV2 -hCHM ).  
Risks associated with the administration procedure  (subretinal delivery)  
• Cataract  including cataract subcapsular and cataract nuclear ;  
• Conjunctival hemorrhage;  
• Eye pain;  
• Diplopia; 
• Eye irritation ; 
• Posterior capsule opacification ;  
• suture related complication ;   
• Intraocular pressure increased ; 
• Corneal disorder;  
• Corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_408198];  
• Dellen (localized dehydration of the cornea) ; 
• Eye pruritis ; 
• Macular hole; 
• Macular cyst ; 
• Visual acuity reduced ; 
• Headache.  
Additional potential risk, not listed above, that have been associated with the administration 
procedure and investigational material in the AAV2 -hRPE65v2 studies are : 
• Retinal tear and retinal detachment  
• Ocular inflammation or infection  
• Macular disorders  
• Vitreous opacities  
A small scar at the retinotomy site is expected, as part of the healing process post -surgery. The 
scar results from penetration of the retina with the subretinal injection cannula and the 
subsequent apposition of the cannula against the underlying RPE. Sinc e the postnatal retina is 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 43  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  terminally differentiated, cells do not divide to replace those that are damaged by [CONTACT_622773]. Instead, glial cells fill in the neural retinal penetration site and RPE cells directly 
underlying this site can migrate towa rds the retina. The net result of these changes is that the 
boundaries of the different tissue layers are maintained. The retinotomy site will result in a blind spot smaller than the physiologic blind spot resulting from the presence of the optic disc 
and, indeed is not detectable with standard visual field testing; it will not involve the central 
portion of the macula. It is highly unlikely that the subject will be aware of this blind spot or that it will have a negative impact on visual function as neither global retinal function nor 
visual acuity (function of the macula/fovea) is affected by [CONTACT_622774]. It would require 
sophisticated visual field analysis in a person with good vision to detect a decrease in retinal  
function after retinotomy in th is point location. T he retinotomy scar is not expected to cause 
diminis hed vision in subjects participating in this trial.  
Other expected AE would be those related to surgery, including post -operative inflammation 
such as corneal edema or abrasion, mild anterior chamber reaction (cell and flare), mild lens 
opacity (“feathering”), change in eye pressure, diplopia, mild choroidal edema, and retinal 
edema or hemorrhage at the site of injection. The symptoms, if any, would be blurred vision, 
photophobia, lacrim ation and iritis -type eye discomfort. These are treatable by [CONTACT_622775] 
(atropi[INVESTIGATOR_622733]), anti -inflammatory medication with medicine administered locally (eye drops 
or injection) or systemically (steroidal or non- steroidal).  
In the clinical and non- clinical studies done to date, more serious possible AE were not 
observed, including corneal decompensation with opacification, glaucoma in the treated eye, iris atrophy with synechiae, persistent vitreous opacification, persistent retinal detachment 
(exudative or rhegmatogenous), retinal membrane with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, optic 
atrophy, cystoid macular edema (retinal swelling), and hypotony with eventual phthisis bulbi 
(ocular atrophy). If these events occur, some would be anticipated to resolve without treatment, 
while others would require treatment. Treatment for corneal de- compensation would involve 
corneal transplant, cataract would require extraction, vitrectomy would be used to treat vitreous opacities, retinal reattachment procedures would be used to treat non- resolving retinal 
detachment, filtration surgery or medication could be used to treat glaucoma, infection treated with antibiotics, macular edema would require treatment with anti- inflammatory agents. The 
most serious AE would be intractable glaucoma or phthisis bulbi, which could lead to a blind, painful eye. Those conditions can be treated with a peri -ocular injection of alcohol or 
Thorazine to treat the pain or eventual enucleation, if absolutely necessary.  The worst possible 
morbidity would be complete loss of vision.  
General Anesthesia Risks  
Serious but rare adverse events from general anesthesia and surgery in otherwise healthy individuals include seizure, coma and death.   
Risks Based on Non- Clinical Studies  
A toxicology study in non- human primates  evaluating two doses of GMP -comparable AAV2 -
hCHM vector ( 3x1011 and 7.5x1011 vg/eye ) showed that the  higher dose , which is [ADDRESS_829315] -injection, but not at the earlier (3 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 44  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  week) time point. Ocular histopathology at 3 weeks in both vehicle and AAV -injected eyes  
showed the predicted pathological changes due to the surgical manipulations; these included 
mild inflammatory lesions and local trauma to the RPE cells at the site of injection. 
Inflammation was present in many of the eyes , and t here was a trend toward increasing 
inflammation related to the higher dose of AAV2- hCHM and the longer time to s acrifice of 
animals. On the numeric inflammatory scale used to score the changes in these eyes (from 0 -4, 
with 4 being severe inflammation), there were no eyes in the study with an inflammatory score greater than 1. This indicates that in the eyes with the  most prominent inflammatory changes, 
the inflammation was mild . 
It is not clear what the mild focal loss of photoreceptors  observed in animals injected with the 
high dose of AAV2- hCHM and sacrificed at day 91 was due to. The possibilities include: 
complication s of the subretinal injection, the AAV2 capsid, or expression of human REP -[ADDRESS_829316] effects on efficacy in this study nor in  the phase 
1 trial  of AAV2 -hRPE65v2, or in the follow -on trial ( Maguire et al., 2008; Maguire et al ., 
2009; Bennett et al ., 2012).  
An immune response is not expected based on the relatively small dose of vector to be 
administered in this study, compared similarly to the dose of AAV2- hRPE65v2 used for 
inherited retinal degeneration due to autosomal -recessive RPE65  gene mutations . When 
compared to the dose of AAV2- hFIX (IND #9398 , inactive ) that was under study for 
hemophilia B , the maximum total dose to be administered to subjects in this eye study is 
approximately 250 times less than the total dose at which the cell -mediated responses 
(described above ) in the liver trial occurred. Accordingly, the dose of AAV2 -hCHM  used for 
this study of choroideremia compares favorably to the dose of AAV2- hRPE65v2 used for the 
RPE65 trials , and not expected to result in immune responses that prevent efficacy or 
successful injection into the contralateral eye  during follow -on studies .  
One hypothetical adverse event would be the unexpected effects of the transgene on function of 
 
   
Protocol AAV2 -hCHM -101     Page 45  
08 Apr 2020  (Version 10)   Confidential  the central nervous system (CNS) due to transduction of ganglion cells (which send their axons 
to the brain via the optic nerve). This event is considered unlikely; however, if there was 
evidence of CNS dysfunction associated with retinal transgene expression, laser ablation or a 
complete retinectomy could be performed. This would destroy the ganglion cell axons and the  
brain would no longer be exposed to the transgene product.  
9.4.3 Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
This is a Phase 1 /[ADDRESS_829317] retinal degeneration 
or improve vision in the administered subjects . Similar doses of the vector used in the RPE65  
trials demonstrated safety and efficacy. Thus, from previous clinical experience it is suspected 
that the doses of vector proposed here are likely to be safe .  
The starting dose for the trial is 5x1010 vg per eye, which is roughly equivalent to the middle 
dose previously used  in the RPE65  Phase 1 trial of AAV2 -hRPE65v2, and which resulted in 
efficacy in the 6 subjects who received this dose  of vector . Since the current study is employing 
the same serotype but a different transgene, and the non-clinical data suggests that this may 
provide efficacy (Section 1.4), it seems reasonable to start within  the dose range used in the 
RPE65  trial. Dose Group 2 (1x1011 vg per eye) is also within the dose range established in the 
RPE65 studies and is comparable to the high dose used for the RPE65 Phase 1 trial . Further, 
the Sponsor anticipate s lack of toxicity at th ese doses, based on the non- clinical data and 
pharmacology/toxicology data in non- human primates  (Section 1.4) .  
Based on the earlier data from  clinical trials conducted under FDA IND # [ZIP_CODE], and from 
other trials of inherited retinal degeneration due to autosomal -recessive RPE65  gene mutations , 
as well as the non- clinical data that are  described in section 1.4,  it is possible  that the proposed 
starting Dose [ADDRESS_829318] benefit 
to the subjects. The anticipated benefit:risk ratio is at least as favorable as the alternative 
approaches, as there is no FDA approved treatment for choroideremia. In this research context, there may be poten tial risks that are unexpected or unknown.

9.[ADDRESS_829320] for study enrollment. Potential subjects will generally be approached in person, 
called on the telephone, or emailed to initiate the consenting process. The study’s  informe d 
consent documents are used as an “educational tool” for the subject s and subjects’ female 
partners  to read, and ask questions of the Investigators . The content of the informed consent 
documents follows federal regulatory requirements. The informed consent process will take 
place in a private setting, for example in a clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], or in a doctor’s office. Steps 
will be taken to avoid coercion or undue inducements; the subject  or subject’s female partner  
will be given as much time as needed to m ake a decision about study enrollment  and/or release 
of medical information . The consent will be signed only after the subject  and/or subject’s 
female partner  have had all questions answered to their satisfaction. The Investigators will 
ensure that subjects understand that participation in the study is voluntary and subjects and 
subjects’ female partners understand that authorization of medical information release is voluntary. Subjects will have the option to withdraw from study pa rticipation  and authorization 
of medical information release can be terminated when requested . Both the subject /female 
partner  and the person obtaining consent ( a designated member of the investigative team) will 
sign and date the consent document , and a copy will be given to the subject /female partner . The 
study or data collection can be initiated only after consent signing. Non -English speaking 
subjects are not expected  for enrollment ; however, if a non- English speaking subject is 
considered for enrollment or a non- English speaking female partner is pregnant , a certified 
translated and IRB -approved consent with independent interpreter would be implemented for 
the consenting process .

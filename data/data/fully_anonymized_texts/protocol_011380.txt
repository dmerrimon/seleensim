Date:  06/08/ 2022  Page 4 Background and Rationale  
Criminal justice (CJ) involved individuals have extremely high prevalence of risk factors 
associated with HIV infection including poverty, substance use, transactional sex, high numbers 
of sex partners, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections an d mental illness. African 
Americans (AA) are at disproportionate risk for both incarceration and HIV infections. Arkansas 
incarcerates 1,[ADDRESS_1238120], has an HIV prevalence of 
nearly 500 HIV cases per 100,000 population.3   
A growing body of evidence highlights the efficacy of a once daily medication, 
emtri citabine/tenofovir, also known as pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in reducing HIV 
acquisition.4-[ADDRESS_1238121] be addressed especially among those 
with recent CJ experience . Recently incarcerated individuals often experience a lack of 
access to housing and employment, severance of social support, and discrimination —all of 
which are factors that can impede intervention efficacy and, therefore, must be  incorporated into 
HIV prevention efforts. Thus, the primary goal of our proposed study is to develop a tailored 
PrEP intervention for CJ -involved populations, focusing on both individual and structural level 
factors, in order to reduce the risk for commun ity based HIV acquisition.  We will focus our study 
on the largest county jail in Arkansas  and the largest community corrections office in the state .  
Jails, in contrast to prisons, are facilities where individuals are detained pre -sentencing for 
relativel y short periods of time (days to months).  Jail detainees are on the front lines of the HIV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_36152], yet barriers and facilitators to implementing PrEP – a highly 
effective intervention for reducing HIV risk – has not been studied in this critical population. 
There is also no research on PrEP uptake when offered as an intervention to individuals 
transitioning out of jail .  
We have assembled an Interprofessional team of researchers with expertise in criminal justice, 
HIV and behavioral health .  Our proposed study will: provide a novel exploration of facilitators 
and barriers to PrEP; allow us to target hard to reach populations,  including men who have sex 
with men (MSM) and substance users (both of which are top funding priority groups f or the 
National Institutes of Health) who experience intersecting markers of HIV risk; and inform 
regional, and possibly national, intervention approaches to combat the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_885019].  
Specific Aims  
The spe cific aims of the p roject associated with this protocol are : 
Aim 1:  Perform a qualitative assessment of facilitators and barriers to PrEP uptake 
among high -risk jail detainees, systems and interactor levels.  To achieve this aim we will 
conduct qualitative interviews with three distinct groups of stakeholders:  
1) Systems interviews (n=6);  
2) Interactor interviews (n=8); and

Date:  06/08/ 2022  Page 5 3) Individual Key Informant interviews (n=20).  
Within each of these strata, we aim to collect data representing diverse perspectives with 
respect to int erest, knowledge, attitudes, and barriers (including substance use) to PrEP uptake. 
We will also explore acceptability and feasibility of an intervention to link individuals being 
released from the Pulaski County jail to PrEP services.  
For the purposes of this protocol, Aims 2 and 3 are identical in terms of participant recruitment, 
enrollment and all study procedures  (including data collection and participant follow up) .  The 
primary objective of Aim [ADDRESS_1238122] of the study procedures.  If any changes are made, those 
changes will be submitted to the IRB for further review  and approval prior to initiating Aim 3 .  If 
no changes are made, this IRB protocol will se rve as the protocol for both Aims 2 and 3.   
Aim 2:  Develop the PrEP -LINK intervention and perform an open label evaluation with  
high -risk HIV negative individuals being discharged from the Pulaski County Jail  or 
recently discharged from a correctional setting  and reporting to a local Community 
Corrections facility or Re -Entry Center, including: Central Arkansas Community 
Corrections Center, East Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center, Hidden Creek 
Opportunity Center , Quality Living Center , Better  Community Development, Inc. , and 
Recovery Centers of Arkansas, .Directly informed from formative work (Aim 1), we will 
develop the PrEP -LINK intervention, which will include the use of a community health worker 
(CHW) and adherence counseling (based on ADA PT-ITT) approach to enhance PrEP care and 
overcome barriers to uptake in this population. We will then perform an open pi[INVESTIGATOR_885020] a correctional facility  
Aim 3:  Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_885021] -LINK intervention among high -risk HIV negative 
individuals being released from the Pulaski County Jail  or recruited within [ADDRESS_1238123] already completed through Aim 1, which was approved under a separate IRB protocol 
(#207297).  Once we have finalized the intervention content, we will conduct the Aim [ADDRESS_1238124].   
 
Description of the Community Health Work er (CHW) Intervention  (Aims 2 and 3) :  The 
intervention arm in both Aims 2 and 3 will receive additional support by a community health 
worker ( CHW ) who will assist with healthcare and social service navigation and will utilize 
adherence counseling techniques.  The CHW we are employing is [CONTACT_885055] , who is a 
trained CHW with a strong knowledge base of both healthcare and social service system s in the 
greater Little Rock area.  As per the model our intervention is based upon (the national 
Transitions Clinic Network [TCN], which has 14 sites across the country), [CONTACT_663015]  has a

Primary outcomes will include acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, as well as PrEP 
uptake. Secondary outcomes will include adherence and retention in PrEP -related med ical care 
at three, six and [ADDRESS_1238126] efficacy of 
the intervention in improving PrEP uptake, adherence, and retention in care among transitioning 
out of jail.  
Between study aims 2 & 3 a total of 120 subjects will be consented with approximately 10 
for aim 2 and 110 for aim 3.  
NOTE:  For this IRB application, we are only seeking approval for activities related to 
AIMs 2-3.  AIM 1 was addressed in IRB #207297 .   
Study Design  and Procedures  
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design :  Given the scope of inquiry and 
proposed project’s aims, criminal justice (CJ) involved individuals are the human subjects of this 
project. Our research team understands that CJ -involved individuals repres ent a vulnerable 
population, as the correctional setting may be perceived as a coercive environment. Therefore, 
all research must be conducted with rigorous ethical standards and with numerous safeguards in 
place to protect participants. A 2006 Institute o f Medicine report on research involving prisoners 
called for the following requirements:  
1) a risk -benefit approach, whereby [CONTACT_885031];  
2) research should be conducted with “collaborative  responsibility,” referring to the idea that 
the design and implementation of the research should include the input of all relevant 
parties (including prisoners and correctional administrators);  
3) voluntary informed consent must be obtained,  and privacy maxi mized; and

compliance with approved protocols and to detect and report adverse events. The 
research plan described in this application complies with all of these requirements . Below 
each aim  and the relevant human participants’  involvement, characteristics and design 
are described.  
There will be two groups that participants can be assigned to if they choose to participate in the 
study. Each person will be randomly assigned to one of these groups.  One group will provide 
information about PrEP and HIV prevention and referral to PrEP c linics in the community.  The 
second group will the same as the first group but will also provide access to a CHW  who will 
assist them with getting to a PrEP clinic and also helpi[INVESTIGATOR_885023].  
A member from the study team will rev iew the informed consent documents  with the prospective 
participants  and ask them questions to make sure they are eligible to participate in this study  
(PrEP -LINK eligibility and demographic screening form ).  Their responses to the prescreen form 
will not be shared with anyone outside of the study and will not contain any identifying 
information. They will be kept completely private, and will be in a password protected, encrypted 
database on a secured server at UAMS that can only be accessed by [CONTACT_25755] s tudy staff.  
Before we collect this information, we ask that participants provide their name [CONTACT_885051] a 9 -digit study -ID number to de -identify their responses.  Names will be stored separately 
from responses in locked filing cabinet in a secure d office and will never be connected. At the 
end of the study, the link between the name [CONTACT_885052].

them to one of the two stud y groups. Once assigned to a group, after the completion of the

The participants will take place in the following activities over the course of 12 months:  
 An HIV test using the FDA -approved OraQUICK ADVANCE® Rapid HIV Antibody Tests  
or self -report of recent (within 12 months) HIV test within correctional facility . 
o If HIV rapid testing is completed during eligibility screening visit, d uring the 
testing process the participant will receive:  
(1) Pre -test counseling:  A member of the research team , who has been trained 
by [CONTACT_885033],  will provide 
information on HIV and the meanings of a posi tive and negative test. Participants 
will have an opportunity to ask questions and will be offered prevention 
counseling.  
(2) HIV testing:  To test for HIV, a member of the research team will use the FDA 
approved OraQUICK ADVANCE® Rapid HIV Antibody Test.  
(3) Post -test counseling:  They will find out the results of their HIV test about [ADDRESS_1238128]. Additionally, any information collected up to that 
point will be destroyed and their partici pation in the study will be complete.  
o All participants will receive : 
(4) PrEP counseling:  Following screening and after the completion of the 
baseline assessment survey, participants will receive information about PrEP 
using materials developed by [CONTACT_7698] 
(CDC). This includesa brochure that lists local cl inics where PrEP is available 
and how to make an appointment.  
 If they decide to initiate PrEP, they will be prescribed PrEP medications 
by a physician in accordance with routine clinical care at their local PrEP 
clinic in the community.

participant’s  in case their phone number is disconnected or change d. We will contact  [CONTACT_885039]. Participants will be cons idered to have missed a [ADDRESS_1238138] been  released from incarceration within 30 days . 
Because many types of HIV related risks are present in this population (e.g. MSM or PWID), we 
will recruit participants from the following groups: MSM, PWID and heterosexual non -substance 
users (more participants may be enrolled, as needed) .  For the final two categories, (PWID and 
heterosexuals ), we will recruit equal numbers of men and women. The recruitment will be 
completed when [ADDRESS_1238139] 100 participants complete the 
protocol .  
Inclusion criteria include: 1) being at least 18 years old; 2) having at least on e self -reported HIV 
risk factor; and 3) currently incarcerated in the Pulaski County Jail  or recently released  (within 
30 days ) from a correctional facility  and residing in Central Arkansas .  We will employ t hree 
primary methods of recruitment. The first will be educational groups in which a  member of the 
study team will conduct weekly health related education sessions in the jail  pertaining to HIV 
and prevention . Promotion of this health and wellness class will be conducted by [CONTACT_885040] j ail facility outlining how detainees  can enroll in the class provided by [CONTACT_885041].   We 
will indicate to both jail staff and to potential participants (during the beginning of each session) 
that these sessions are research related and strictly voluntary.  We will also clearly state to jail 
staff to specifically tell jail detainees that participation in these session is voluntary and that the 
sessions are part of an ongoing research study.  Among individuals who participate in these 
sessions, a member of the stu dy team will approach potential participants individually, briefly 
explain the purpose and procedures for the intervention , and ask them if they wish to participate 
in the baseline  interview expected to last about 60 to 90 minutes.  The second  method of 
recruitment will be through  local Community Corrections  facilities  and re -entry centers. [CONTACT_885058] will hold educational  sessions at the recruitment sites  (either in person or over Zoom 
for safety during the Covid -19 pandemic)  where she will inform people a bout the study and

Exclusion Criteria  
Potential participants unable to provide informed consent, including people with severe mental 
illness requiring immediate treatment or with mental illness limiting their ability to participate 
(e.g., dementia), will be excluded.  
Risks and Benefits  
While the risks related to human subjects’ participation in this study are minimal, we 
acknowledge that the  possibility of harm to participants  does exist.  We recognize that 
participants will be asked to provide potentially sensitive information (including illicit substance 
use and sexual risk behaviors and criminal justice involvement) and therefore m ay experience 
discomfort, anxiety, or stress in responding to certain study questions. As such, as part of the 
informed consent procedure, participants will be advised that their answers will be confidential, 
and issues discussed will in no way impact thei r criminal justice status, nor ability to obtain or be 
referred to medical care or social services. At the start of the interview, participants will be 
informed that they can skip and refuse to answer any questions that they may find 
uncomfortable or embar rassing.  
The potential benefits to participants include reduction in risk of HIV acquisition with use of pre -

correctional and community health policy and practice and  may enjoy the interaction with 
members of the study team.  
Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_885029] : All members of the research team will treat participant data with the 
strictest attention to confidentiality. Data will be collected from participants in settings in the 
community and in co rrectional facilities in such a way that neither privacy nor confidentiality is 
compromised. All records and data will be safeguarded in accordance with the policies of the 
participating IRB. Questionnaires will not include participants’ name [CONTACT_885054].   Data for this phase of the study will be brief eligibility screens study ( see Appendix 
PrEP -LINK eligibility and demographic screening form)  and the baseline surveying tool (see 
Appendix PrEP -LINK Baseline Battery ).  Only members of the study team (PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zaller, co -Is [CONTACT_885059] and the study RA s, Heather Horton  and Brooklyn Tody ) will have access to the  data. At 
the conclusion of the study, the data will be stored electronically until analyses are completed.  
Electronic Data wi ll be kept for the requisite [ADDRESS_1238142] -protected folder/document on a 
secure UAMS server. All locator forms will be stored separately from the responses and 
destroyed at the completion  of data collection.  
Data Analysis  
Measures . The primary intervention measures, including common measure across both studies 
are provided above in the description of Aim 2.  As part of Aim 3, data will be collected at all 
follow -up time points (3, 6 a nd 12 months) by [CONTACT_272003]. Additional measures are provided 
below.  
Additional Secondary Measures f or Aim 3  
1) PrEP adherence.  Self-reported PrEP adherence will supplement clinical chart 
abstraction. An assessment of the optimal period for self -reported antiretroviral adherence 
(using electronic monitoring data as the standard for predictive validity) found that longer time 
periods (e.g., 30 days versus 4 days) were more accurate for assessing adherence than shorter 
time periods.51 Therefore, we will use adherence over a 30 -day period as self -reported 
adherence outcome.

Date:  06/08/ 2022  Page 16 2) HIV risk behaviors/behavioral adjustment.  Participants’ HIV -transmission risk 
behaviors will be assessed with the  TCU HIV/AIDS Risk Assessment,  which is designed 
specifically for CJ -involved individuals,[ADDRESS_1238143] 
more detailed data on sexual beh aviors, including number of sexual partners, sexual activities, 
and condom use based on EXPLORE study measures. These measures are valid and reliable 
among high -risk men.53 
3) Substance use.  Participants’ alcohol use will be measured with the Alcohol Use 
Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT -C) and the Addiction Severity Index - Lite 
(ASI-Lite), both of which have been validated for use with diverse populations (e.g., African 
American, Hispanic/Latino, and White).[ADDRESS_1238144] in the study and who are determined eligible for participation.  
Among these, we will calculate the percentages of those who reported being interested who 
were actually eligible ; the number eligible who  were successfully recruite d and consented; 
randomized; and assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months (enrollment and completion of 
study related activities for >80% will indicate study feasibility).  We will relay in individual 
detainees self -reporting in interest in participating in the study in the following ways.  Firstly, the 
study CHW will be conducting weekly educational sessions.  At the end of these sessions, 
individuals can disclose through an evaluation form whether or not they are interested in t he 
study and if they are, a member of the study team will set up a follow up appointment to assess 
eligibility.   The second way is direct referrals from the medical staff who may, with the 
permission of the detainee, make a referral to the study for eligibility assessment.   The thi rd 
method of recruitment will be through local Community Corrections facilities and re -entry 
centers. The study CHW will hold educational sessions at the recruitment sites (either in person 
or over Zoom for safety during the Covid -19 pandemic) where she wi ll inform people about the 
study and conduct eligibility screeners with those who are interested, with the help of the 
research team.   
  The acceptability  of the intervention will be determined with descriptive statistics of the 
participants’ acceptability  ratings, including whether they think the intervention is acceptable. 
Acceptability is define as > 80% of participants expressing high satisfaction with the intervention 
based on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire - Revised. We will also review data co llected by 
[CONTACT_885042].  
 The preliminary efficacy of the intervention  will be determined by [CONTACT_885043] . A secondary 
outcome will be PrEP adherence defined by [CONTACT_885044] -report  at 3, 6, and 12 months. Following intent -to-treat (ITT) principles, all

Date:  06/08/ [ADDRESS_1238145] bivariate analytic 
techniques, such as Spearman rank -order correlations, odds ratios, and Fisher's exact tests, will 
be used to assess preliminary associations between the intervention and each measur e of PrEP 
uptake and to identify factors associated with the outcomes. Generalized linear regression 
models will be informed by [CONTACT_885045].  
In addition, we will test the randomization process  by [CONTACT_885046]'s exact test 
for dichotomous variables, chi -square tests for nominal variables, t-tests for normally distributed 
continuous variables, and Wilcoxon signed -rank tests for non -normally distributed con tinuous 
variables, with statistical significance determined at alpha < 0.05. Any variable for which 
randomization does not result in equal proportions in each arm will be incorporated into the 
multiple -regression models as a potential confounding variable.  Attrition effects will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_885047]. Thus, we can determine any potential bias introduced by 
[CONTACT_885048].  
The prima ry analysis  will compare uptake of PrEP by [CONTACT_885049] -reported behaviors of PrEP usage  at the 3, 6, and 12 month visits between 
the study arms. Changes in self -reported adherence (verification with clinical c hart abstraction, 
including lab tests for serum levels of medications), sexual behavior adjustment, post -
incarceration contextual variables, and substance use will also be examined. Moreover, group 
differences in PrEP uptake, time -to-uptake, and number of PrEP clinic appointments kept will be 
compared. All analyses will use two -tailed tests of significance,  with significance at alpha = 0.05. 
We will use generalized linear models with properly chosen link functions to analyze longitudinal 
data for each study  aim. These models will be estimated with generalized estimating equations 
that use robust standard error estimates57,58; they provide an extension of regression analysis to 
the case of correlated or repeated observations and allow for the inclusion of categorical and 
count -dependent variables a nd for appropriate modeling of covariance structures when 
observations are correlated across time.  
Power Calculations . Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the primary emphasis will be on the 
acceptability and feasibility of the two arms; hence, power is limited to determine efficacy of the 
intervention. We used GPower59 software to estimate the difference in proportions between the 
two groups, with respect to PrEP -LINK age, that could be detected with 80% power. Given 40 
participants per  group (total n = 80), one -tailed alpha = .05, and a proportion of 0.[ADDRESS_1238146] 80% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_1238147] (IRB) to conduct the study.

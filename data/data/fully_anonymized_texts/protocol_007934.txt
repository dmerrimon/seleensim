The subject experiences [ADDRESS_23271] will report to the Clinical Research Center the afternoon prior to each Cohort 
Treatment Day (i.e., on Cohort Treatment Day -1). The subject wi ll eat a gluten -free dinner at the 
Clinical Research Center and will subsequently begin an overnight fast (nothing by [CONTACT_24316] 12 hours).
On each Cohort Treatment Day, a single -lumen catheter (nasogastric [NG] tube) will be introduced 
into the st omach. (Note: An orogastric [OG] tube may be used if the Investigator determines that it 
is preferable for a given subject.) Auscultation and gastric pH testing will be used to confirm tube 
placement.
Pretreatment buffer solution, followed by [CONTACT_5349], will be administered orally immediately prior 
to beginning the ingestion of a standardized 3 g gluten -containing study meal (Group 1 and Group 
2) or a standardized 1 g gluten -containing or 6 g gluten -containing study meal (Group 3). The entire 
study  meal w ill be ingested within 10 minutes of study drug administration.
The use of the NG tube will facilitate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_24238] (i.e., to assess gluten degradation). A gastric sample (approximately 5 mL) will be obtained 
via the NG tube before pretreatment buffer solution administration. A gastric sample (entire gastric 
content) will be obtained via the NG tube [ADDRESS_23272]. A gastric sample (approxim ately 5 mL) will be obtained via the NG tube 20 
and 35 minutes after study drug administration, and a gastric sample (entire gastric content) will be 
obtained via the NG tube [ADDRESS_23273] ing will also be performed on these samples; the pH of the gastric sample obtained before 
pretreatment buffer solution administration will be used to confirm that the NG tube is in the 
stomach and will serve as the pretreatment pH measurement. The aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] d volume of the entire 
gastric content sample obtained [ADDRESS_23274] will be measured before a 
portion is removed for pH testi ng and gluten quantification.
A blood sample will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration and at several 
time points for approximately 480 minutes (8 hours) after study drug administration on each Cohort 
Treatment Day to evaluate sys temic exposure to PvP001 and PvP002.
A urine sample will be obtained before and approximately [ADDRESS_23275] consen ts to this.

Part 3
This is a single -blind, placebo -controlled, single d ose study of PvP003 , a tablet formulation, using 
gastric sample aspi[INVESTIGATOR_24239]: (a) In Group 1, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 600 mg with pretreatment
buffer solution before a standardized 1 g gluten - containing study meal, (b) In Group 2, administration
of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 600 mg without pretreatment buffer solution before a standardized 
1 g gluten-containing study meal, (c) In Group 3, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 
600 mg without pretreatment buffer solution after an approximately 50 mL portion of a standardized
1 g gluten-containing study meal, (d) In Group 4, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 
600 mg without pretreatment buffer solution before a standardized gluten -free study meal followed 
approximately 30 minutes later by a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal , and (e) In 
Group 5, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 150 mg without pretreatment buffer 
solution before a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study  meal. Data from both the 600 mg dose 
and the 150 mg split tablet dose will pro vide data on activity across the expected clinically relevant 
dose range to inform future formulation development and doses for inclusion in planned clinical 
trials.
Thirty -six unique subjects (6 subjects in each of the following four Groups :Group 1, Grou p 2, 
Group 3, and Group 4 , and 12 subjects in Group 5 ) will participate in Part 3 and will receive 
PvP003 placebo and PvP003 150 mg or 600 mg as noted below ; each of these 36subjects will 
receive both treatments, but will be randomized to the treatment or der. Part [ADDRESS_23283] may not participate in more than one Group. Enrollment of subjects in Group 1, Group 2, 
Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5 will occur sequentially.

The subject experiences a study drug -related SAE
The subject experiences [ADDRESS_23285] will report to the Clinical Research Center the afternoon prior to each Cohort 
Treatment Day (i.e., on Cohort Treatment Day -1). The subject will eat a gluten -free dinner at the 
Clinical Research Center and will subsequently begin an overnight fast (nothing by [CONTACT_24316] 12 hours).
On each Cohort Treatment Day, a single -lumen catheter (nasogastric [NG] tube) will be introduced 
into the stomach. (Note: An OG tube may be used if the Investigator determines that it is preferable 
for a given subject.) Auscultation and gastric pH testing will be used to confirm tube placement.
Group 1
Pretreatment buffer solution, followed by [CONTACT_5349], will be administered orally immediately prior 
to beginning the ingestion of a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal. The entire study 
meal will be ingested within 10 minutes of study drug administration.
Group 2 and Group 5
Study  drug will be administe red orally immediately prior to beginning the ingestion of a 
standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal. The entire study meal will be ingested within

Group 3
An approximately 50 mL portion of a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal will be 
ingested within 5 minutes. Study drug will be administered orally immediately after completing the 
ingestion of the approximately 50 mL portion of the study meal (th is is approximately one sixth of 
the entire study  meal). The remaining portion of the standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal 
will begin to be ingested immediately after study drug administration; this remaining portion of the 
study  meal will be inge sted within [ADDRESS_23286] ed within 10 minutes. No pretreatment buffer solution will be administered.
Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5
The use of the NG tube will facilitate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_24238] (i.e., to assess gluten degradation). A gastric sample (approximately 5 mL) will be obtained 
via the NG tube before pretreatment buffer solution administration (Group 1), before study drug 
administration (Group 2 ,Group 4 , and Group 5 ), or before ingestion of a 50 mL portion of a 
standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal (Group 3). A gastric sample (approximately 15 mL) 
will be obtained via the NG tube [ADDRESS_23287]. A gastric sample (entire gast ric content) will be obtained [ADDRESS_23288]. 
Gastric pH testing will also be performed on these samples; the pH of the gastric sample obtained 
before pretreatment buffer solution administration (Group 1), before study drug administration 
(Group 2 ,Group 4 and Group 5 ), or before ingestion of a 50 mL portion of a standardized 1 g 
gluten -containing study meal (Group 3) will be used to confirm that the NG tube is in the s tomach 
and will serve as the pretreatment pH measurement. The aspi[INVESTIGATOR_24240] 
15mL gastric sample obtained [ADDRESS_23289] will be measured 
before a portion is removed for pH testing and gluten quantification.
A blood s ample will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration (Group 1), 
before study drug administration (Group 2, Group 4 ,and Group 5 ), or before ingestion of a 50 mL 
portion of a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal (Group 3), and at several time points for 
approximately 480 minutes (8 hours) after study drug administration on each Cohort Treatment 
Day to evaluate sy stemic exposure to PvP003.
A urine sample will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration (Group 1), 
before study drug administration (Group 2, Group 4 ,and Group 5 ), or before ingestion of a 50 mL 
portion of a standardized 1 g gluten -
containing study meal (Group 3), and approximately 
240minutes after study drug administration on each Cohort Treatmen t Day to test for gl uten 
immunogenic peptides, provided the subject consents to this.

Efficacy Assessments:
In Part 2 of the study, the concentration of immunogenic gluten peptides remaining in the stomach 
after treatment with study drug and ingestion of a standardized gluten-containing meal will be measured 35 minutes (Group 1 and Group 2) and 20, 35, and 65 minutes (Group 3) after study drug administration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on the commercially available monoclonal R5 and G12 antibodies that are specific for immunogenic fractions of gluten. 
In Part 3 of the study, the concentration of immunogenic gluten peptides remaining in the stomach 
after treatment with study drug and ingestion of a standardized gluten-containing meal will be measured 35 and 65 minutes (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, and Group 5) and 65 minutes (Group 4)after study drug administration using ELISA based on the commercially available monoclonal R5 and G12 antibodies that are specific for immunogenic fractions of gluten. 
Gastric samples will be banked for possible future testing for gluten degradation, provided the 
subject consents to this.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:
Pharmacokinetic testing will be done to evaluate systemic exposure to PvP001, PvP002, and PvP003.A blood sample for PK testing will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration 
and approximately 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 480 minutes after study drug administration on the Cohort Treatment Day in Part  1 and Part 2 of the study. A blood sample for 
PK testing will also be obtained at the 24-Hour Safety Assessment, approximately 24 hours after study drug administration in Part 1 of the study.
A blood sample for PK testing will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration 
(Group 1), before study drug administration (Group 2, Group 4, and Group 5), or before ingestion of a 50 mL portion of a standardized 1 g gluten-containing study meal (Group 3), and 
approximately 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, and [ADDRESS_23326] daily dose of study drug on Day 1 and Day 5 of each Cohort Treatment Period in Part 4 of the study.CCI

Testing of these samples for PvP001, PvP002 , and PvP003 will be performed using a validated 
method.
Safety Assessments:
Safety assessments will be conducted throughout the study and will include monitoring of AEs, 
GSQs, phy sical examinations, vital signs, weight assessments, clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), ADA testing, serum and urine pregnancy tests (in females), and ECGs.
The GSQ will include nine items (abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, 
constipation, di arrhea, passing gas, belching/burpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], nausea, and heartburn), each rated on a five -
point Likert scale on which the lowest score, 0, denotes no symptoms and the highest score, 4, 
denotes the most pronounced symptoms. In Part [ADDRESS_23327] wi ll complete the GSQ 
on the Cohort Treatment Day pre -dose (i.e., before pretreatment buffer solution administration) and 
post-dose (i.e., after completion of study meal ingestion) to ensure that all gastrointestinal 
complaints are reported by [CONTACT_423]. I n Part [ADDRESS_23328] will complete 
the GSQ on each Cohort Treatment Day pre -dose (i.e., before and after NG tube placement) and 
post-dose (i.e., after completion of study meal ingestion) to ensure that all gastrointestinal 
complai nts are reported by [CONTACT_423]. In Part [ADDRESS_23329] will complete the GSQ 
on Day 1 and Day 5 of each Cohort Treatment Period pre -dose (i.e., before administration of the 
first daily dose of study drug) and on Day [ADDRESS_23330]-dose (i.e., after 
completion of breakfast ingestion ), as well as every day  at bedtime from Day [ADDRESS_23331].
A blood sample will be obtained at the Follow Up Anti-Drug Antibody Blood Sampling Visits 14 ±
2 day s and 28 ± 2 days after the Cohort Treatment Day (Part 1) ,after the final Cohort Treatment 
Day (Part 2 and Part 3 ), or after Day  5 of the second Cohort Treatment Period (Part 4) to test for 
ADA to PvP001 ,PvP002 , and PvP003 . Testing of samples for ADA will be performed using 
validated assay s. Confirmed positive samples will be further tested for neutralizing activity. In a 
Part [ADDRESS_23332] of ADA on safety, efficacy, and PK will be assessed.
Sample Size Justification:
No formal sample size calculations were conducted for Part 1, Part 2, or Part 4 of this study. The 
sample sizes in Part 1 ,Part 2 , and Part 4 of the study were selected to meet the objectives of the 
clinical trial (i.e., to assess the safety and PKof PvP001, PvP002, and PvP003 in Part 1 ,Part 2 , and 
Part 4 , as well as the gluten degradation ability of PvP001 and PvP002 in Part 2 ). In addition, in 
Part [ADDRESS_23333] four subjects would be randomized to each of the six possible 
gluten amount, PvP001 dose, and treatment order combinations ; in Part [ADDRESS_23334] three subjects would be randomized to each of the t wo 
possible treatment orders .
Sample size determination and justification were conducted only for Part 3 of this study. As 
residual gluten <50 mg is regarded as meaningful in reducing gluten -induced symptoms, the sample 
size calculation for Part 3 of the s tudy is based on the proportion of subjects with <50 mg residual 
gluten. For pooled Part 3 Group 2 and Part 3 Group 3, and for Part 3 Group 5, with a sample size of 
12 (i.e., sixsubjects in Group 2 and sixsubjects in Group 3), assuming the true (populati on)

proportion is 85%, the 80% exact confidence interval (CI) will be (62%, 95%) when the obs erved 
rate is 83% (10 out of 12 subjects). Based on the width of this CI, the chosen sample size was 
considered to provide an acceptable level or precision in the estimation of the primary endpoint.
Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses:
Full details of the statistical analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
Part [ADDRESS_23335]’s stomach 
after active treatment relative to the amount of gluten recovered in the same subject’s stomach after 
placebo (comparator) treatment will be reported according to the formula utilized by [CONTACT_24322] 2012 : 
percent of gluten degraded = (1 –active/placebo) x 100. For Group 1, this calculation will be done 
for both active study drug using the MTD (Cohort 2B) and active study drug using the MTD with 
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_24247] (Cohort 2C).
The count and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs and TESA Es will be summarized overall, 
by [CONTACT_1196], by  [CONTACT_24323], by  [CONTACT_764], 
and by [CONTACT_8792]. In Part 2 and Part 3 , AEs and SAEs will also be summarized by 
[CONTACT_24324] (i.e., NG tube placement or presence). All other safety parameters, 
including clinical laboratory values, will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Shift tables may be emp loyed to 
present out -of-range laboratory values and abnormal ECG findings.
Pharmacokinetic analyses to characterize drug exposure will include, at a minimum, determination 
for each Cohort of maximum plasma concentration, time of maximum plasma concentratio n, 
terminal half -life, and areas under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) following the dose 
administration, derived from the plasma concentration -time data. The AUC will be estimated by [CONTACT_24325]. Actual times at which blood sampl es are obtained will be used in PK 
analy ses.
An interim analysis will be performed on a sub setof subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study.

1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE
1.1 Background
Celiac disease (CeD) is an immuno logic disorder in which proximal small intest ine inflammat ion 
is triggered in genetically suscept ible individuals by [CONTACT_24327] o f dietary  gluten. Celiac 
disease is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] a variet y of gastroi ntestinal sympto ms, including d iarrhea, 
steatorrhea, b loating, flatul ence, abdo minal pain , and const ipation. Extraintestinal manifestations 
of the di sease include weight loss ,decreased body  mass index (BMI) , lower-than-expected 
height, abnormal liver funct ion tests (el evated transaminase levels) and other liver disorders, iron 
deficiency anemia, micronutrient deficiencies, low bone mineral densit yand increased fracture 
risk, skin disorders , increased risk of infert ility and pregnancy  com plicat ions in wo men, 
increased ris k of malignancy (e.g., enteropathy -associ ated lymphoma), and increased risk of 
mortalit y(Rubi o-Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006 ). Qualit y of life is adversely  affected by  [CONTACT_24328] (Leffler 2016) .
Celiac disease , consi dered an autoimmune disorder, is commo n throughout the world and its 
prevalence has increased over the past several decades; its prevalence in the US is approximately 
1% 
(Rostom 2006). Its preval ence is increased in patients with a variet y of other autoimmune 
diseases, and patients with CeD appear to be at increased risk for the development of other 
autoimmune diseases (Rubi o
-Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006) .
The di agnosis of CeD is usually init ially based on signs, symptoms, and serologic testing for 
CeD-specific ant ibodies . Serol ogic tests serve as markers of CeD -specific autoimmunit y and are 
dependent on the ingestion of gluten ; when used for diagnostic purposes, such as to confirm a 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798] o f CeD, a positive test obtained while a patient i son a gl uten-containing diet
are supporti ve of the di agnosis. Confirmation of the di agnosis of CeD requi res duodenal mucosal 
biopsies obtained while a patient is on a gluten -containing di et.The immune response to gluten 
in CeD leads to chronic inflammat ion and resultant architectural changes in the intestinal 
mucosa. Hi stologic findings include villous atrophy , crypt hy perplasia, and inflammatory cell 
infiltrat ion(Rubio -Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006).
There are no [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved medicat ions for 
CeD. The only  recommended treatm ent at this tim e is a gluten-free diet ( GFD ). A strict GFD is 
effect ive in most pati ents, wi thresol ution of gastrointest inalsymptom s, intest inal damage , and 
other disease manifestations, but it must be continued throughout the patient’s lifet ime. 
However, som e pati ents have persistent C eD manifestati
ons (symptom s, signs, or ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_24249]) despi[INVESTIGATOR_24250] a GFD for 6 -12 months; this is considered 
non-responsive C eD and occurs in up to 30% (Rubio -Tapia 2013) of  patients. The m ost co mmo n 
cause of non -responsive C eD is inadvertent gl uten ingestion (Rubi o
-Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006), 
which leads to ongoing or intermittent symptoms and intest inal inflammat ion
.
Although the term “gluten -free di et” im plies the complete absence of gluten in the pat ient’s diet, 
this is not possible due to the presence of hidden sources of glu ten in many commercial foods 
and the contaminat ion of foods with trace amounts of gluten. According to the Codex 
Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

Amendment 6 (December 15, 2020) Page 36
Alimentari us2and the Federal Register3, a food l abeled “gluten -free” should have less than 
20parts per millio n (ppm ) of gluten (20 m g of gluten per kilogram of food, or 0.002% ).The 
2013 FDA reco mmendat ion for voluntary  use in food labeling was based in part on this being 
the“lowest l evel at whi ch analy tical methods have been scient ifically validated to reliably and 
consistently detect glu ten across a range of f ood m atrices,” as well as the expected low likelihood
that this level of gluten would cause adverse healt h effects in most individuals wit h CeD.
Thus, t he term “gluten -free diet” actually indicates that the gluten level in the diet i s at levels 
thatare considered to have a low risk o f harm. The exact level below which dietary  gluten is 
considered “harmless” is not known and is likely to vary between individuals due to differing 
levels o f sensit ivity. According to
 Leonard 2017, trace amounts of gluten that may be present in 
foods labeled gluten -free m ay be as harmful as non -adherence to a GFD. O ne study evaluat ing 
intestinalbiopsies in patients with CeD who received 0, 10, or 50 mg of gluten per day  for 
90days concluded that the daily  gluten am ount shoul d be <50 m g 
(Catassi 2007). A system atic 
review fo und that l ess than [ADDRESS_23346] pati ents wi th CeD 
(Akobeng 2008; Rubio -Tapia 2013 ).
Quest ionnaire -based stu dies have highlighted the difficult y with maintaining a stri ct GFD despi[INVESTIGATOR_24251], with frequent accidental (including inadvertent) gluten ingest ion 
(Hall 2013);  dissat isfaction with the GFD and interest in novel therap ies (Aziz 2011); barri ers to 
maintaining a GFD including restaurant eating and the availabilit y and cost of gluten -free foods 
(Tennyso n
2013); the high treatment burden ( Shah 2014) and its negat ive impact on qualit y of 
life ( Wolf2017); and the interest in and need for medicat ion (Aziz 2011; Tennyso n 2013).
As noted in the report of the third Gastroenterology Regulatory  Endpo ints and Advancement of 
Therap eutics workshop held in 2015 
(Leffler 2016 ), limitat ions to the adherence to and 
effect iveness of the GFD include the potential for gluten contamination when dining out and 
with the use of m edicati ons and supplements. Patients who report persistent intest inal or extra -
intestinal symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_24252] a GFD could especially benefit from non -
dietary  therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], according to the report. The workshop report also noted that patients desire 
non-dietary  treatm ents for CeD and are more interested in therapi[INVESTIGATOR_24253]. It was concluded that there is 
a high unmet medical need for therapy  beyond the GFD (i .e., pharm acologic interventi ons). 
Although there currently is no non -dietary  therapy  with FDA approval  for CeD, pharmacol ogic 
treatm ents for CeD are being evaluated in clinical trials, including supplemental enzyme therapy .
One co mponent of gluten, gliadin, const itutes approximately  50% of  the total  protein 
composition of  gluten and is rich in the amino acids proline (P) and glutamine (Q). In all 
individuals, gliadin undergoes only partial digestion by [CONTACT_6026], pancreatic, and inte stinal  brush 
border proteases in the upper gastrointestinal tract, as these proteases are unable to cleave the 
proline -and glutamine -rich regi ons wi thin gliadin. These inco mpletely digested peptides enter

the small intestine and, in suscept ible individual s, can tri gger an immune response 
(Rostom 2006 ; Lindfors 2012; Kaukinen 2015 ; Wolf 2015 ). Thus, oral enzyme supplementation 
with glutenases is designed to target and break down ingested proline -and gl utamine -rich 
pepti des, before they  reach the sm all intestine, into sm aller, non -immunogenic pept ides.
To address the unmet need for pharmaco logic therapy , a variet y of enzymes, including those 
derived fro m bacteri a, fungi, and germinat ing cereals, have been studied (Lindfors 2012 ). In 
published invitro studies, in vivo (animal) studies, and early phase clinical trials in healthy adul t 
subjects and adult patients with CeD treated with these gl utenases, a mixture of a barley -derived 
endoprotease (EP -B2) that targets the amino acid glutamine and a bacterium -derived prolyl 
endopeptidase (SC PEP) that targets the amino acid proline, as well as a fungus ( Aspergillus 
niger )-derived prolyl endoprotease (AN -PEP), have been reported to degrade and decrease the
immunogenicit y of gluten ( Siegel 2006 ; Gass 2007 ; Mitea2008; Tye -Din 2010 ; Siegel 2012 ; 
Salden2015; Janssen 2015). For example,  Siegel 2012 reported that ALV003 (a mixture of 
EP-B2 + SC PEP) 100 mg a nd 300 mg degraded 75% and 88%, respectively , of [ADDRESS_23347] ion with a 
mixture of EP -B2 and SC PEP, designated ALV003. Gluten -specific peripheral T cell responses 
were noted in significantly fewer patients in the group challenged with ALV003 -pretreated 
gluten com pared to the group challenged with placebo -pretreated gluten, and the mean increases 
in T cell responses fro m baseline to day  6 were si gnificant in the group challenged with placebo -
pretreated gluten.
Overall, however, in c linical trials of patients with CeD, symptomatic 
(Tye-Din2010 ; Tack 2013 ;
Lahdeaho 2014; Murray 2017; Syage2017 ) or hi stologic (Tack 2013; Lahdeaho 2014;
Murray 2017) responses associated with the use of these enzym es have not been consistent ly 
seen.
Significant safet y issues have not been reported in these clinical trials wit h EP -B2 + SC PEP 
(ALV003, lat iglutenase) or AN -PEP (Tye
-Din 2010 ; Siegel 2012 ; Tack 2013; Lahdeaho 2014; 
Salden2015; Murray 2017) , including in pat ients with CeD. In the study  reported by  
[CONTACT_24322] 2012, s ystemic exposure to the two components of ALV003 was low (i .e., EP -B2 was 
detected in a single sample collected two hours after dosing in a fasting subject who received the 
highest dose [1800 mg]) . Seven of the subjects who received ALV003 in the fast ing state 
developed ant ibodies to EP -B2, although there were no related clinical symptoms or sequel ae
(Siegel 2012) .AN-PEP has beco me commercially available in the US as a dietary supplement 
(Tolerase®G; DSM, The Netherlands) and, as such, does not require FDA approval.
Com putati onal protein design allows for the developmen t of proteins, such as enzymes, that have 
a specified set of characterist ics and thus would be ideally  suited for the treatm ent of  a target 
disease. An enzyme that specifically targets the proline -glutamine (PQ) di peptide, rather than the 
single amino acid proline (P) or glutamine (Q), 
found in the immunogenic gliadin pept ides is 
desirable as a potenti al treatm ent for CeD(Gordon 2012). Gordon 2012 reported ident ification o f

a naturally -occurring endopeptidase (kumamo lisin-As, designated “Kuma”), active in acidic 
condi tions, from  the bacteri um Alicyclobacillus sen daiensis . These researchers then used 
computati onal protein design and recombinant techno logy to re engineer this enzyme to have and 
to optimize all the traits that woul d make i t suitable for development as oral enzyme therapy  for 
CeD. In vitro studies with a highly act ive version of the enzyme, which the researchers referred 
to as KumaMax, indicated that it degraded >95% of an immunogenic (immunodominant) peptide 
present in α-gliadin within 50 minutes ( Gordon 2012).
As di scussed by [CONTACT_24329]2015, the proteoly tic act ivity required of an oral  enzyme is high, sin ce 
accidental  ingestion o f 1 g of gluten (approximately one -fourth of a slice o f bread) would require 
≥99% degradation within the stomach in a physio logically rel evant time frame to reduce the 
intragastric residual gluten amount to ≤10 mg, which would like ly avoid an immunologic response
within the duodenum. Thus, the versio n of Kuma evaluated in the study  published by  
[CONTACT_24330] 2012 was subsequent ly co mputationa lly redesigned to greatly increase enzymat ic 
activit y, which resul ted in >99% degradati on of  immunogenic pept ides in in vit ro studi es 
(Wolf2015) .In simulated gastric digest ion studies, the enzyme degraded >99.97% of 10,000 
ppm of
 gluten, which resul ted in a rem aining level of gl uten well  below the 20 ppm  thresho ld for 
“gluten free” labeling ( Wolf2015).
Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. has conducted an in vivo animal study  inwhich the enzyme 
was capable of degrading up to >99% of gluten in a rat model of human gastric digest ion(Report 
H005, on file, Millennium Pharmaceut icals, Inc. ). Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has also 
conducted a variety  of other l aboratory  studies wi th Kuma, including a subsequent versio n of the 
enzyme (Kuma062) that was determined to be an optimal version based on comparisons between 
it and previous versio ns and which will be used in the current study . Kuma062 has been shown 
in 
vitro to rapi [INVESTIGATOR_24254] >99% of gluten at doses ranging fro m [ADDRESS_23348] ively than either AN -PEP or EP -B2 + SC PEP, 
including in simulated gastric digest ion studies with a “real world” meal containing a variet y of 
different protein sources in addit ion to gl uten, as well as carbohydrates and fat (Report H007, on 
file, Millennium Pharmaceut icals, Inc. ).
Thus, Kuma062 ’s abilit y to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24255] c condi tions is 
expected to greatly reduce the potential of gluten to stimulate the human immune response and is 
essent ial to justify human studies assessing enzyme activit y in actual  meal digesti on scenari os.
Important ly, even low levels of intest inal gluten exposure can trigger symptoms and mucosal 
inflammat ion in pat ients with CeD.
Finally , the safet y profile of Kuma062 has been established in the clinical and nonclinical studies 
conducted to date; these studies are discussed in the I nvest igator’s Brochure (IB).

oral glutenase appears to be a potential new therapy for CeD.
In particular, given the enzyme’s ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24256], as well as its sa fety profile in clinical and nonclinical studies to date, 
it is important to continue the development of Kuma062 to determine its potential as a new oral
enzyme therapy as an adjunct to a GFD for patients with CeD. Therefore, Phase 1 clinical trials are being conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of Kuma062 in humans.
In the current Phase 1 four-part clinical trial, PvP001 (liquid formulation of Kuma062), PvP002 
(capsule formulation of Kuma062), and PvP003 (tablet formulation of Kuma062) will be studied. 
PvP003, a tablet formulation developed after PvP001 and PvP002 in anticipation of Phase [ADDRESS_23350] been studied in Phase 1 clinical trials; PvP003has not been previously studied in humans.
!In the first part (Part 1) of the study, the safety of single doses of PvP001 and PvP002 
administered in the presence of a standardized gluten-free study meal will be evaluated in 
healthy adult sub jects and in patients with CeD.
!In the second part (Part 2) of the study, the gluten-degrading activity of single doses of 
PvP001 and PvP002 in the stomach in the presence of a standardized gluten-containing 
study meal will be evaluated in healthy adult subjects; the effect of pretreatment with 
seven days of a standard dose of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on the gluten-degrading activity of PvP001 will also be evaluated in this part of the study.
!In the third part (Part 3) of the study, the gluten-degrading activity of single doses of 
PvP003 in the stomach administered (a) with pretreatment buffer solution 
  
before a standardized gluten-containing study meal (just as 
pretreatment buffer solution is being administered with the enzyme in liquid and capsule 
formulations in Part 2 subjects, it is being administered with the enzyme in tablet 
formulation in this group of Part 3 subjects), (b) without pretreatment buffer solution before a standardized gluten -containing study meal, (c) during a standardized gluten-
containing study meal, and (d) before a standardized gluten-free study meal followed by 
a standardized gluten-containing study meal will be evaluated in healthy adult subjects; and (e) with a lower dose before a standardized gluten-containing study meal.CCI

8 STUDY DRUG
8.1 Study Drug Description
PvP001 is a liquid containing the active enzyme, Kuma062, in a formulation buffer 
 It will be s upplied as a frozen liquid in 
single-use 5 mL screw-cap polypropylene cryogenic vials, each of which contains approximately
3.5 mL of PvP001 at a concentration of 100 mg/mL.
PvP001 will be thawed approximately 15 minutes pri or to the time of planned administration by 
[CONTACT_24349] (not shaking) the vial approximately eight times, being careful to prevent foaming to preserve protein stability. 
Immediately prior to administration, to achieve the required PvP001 dose to be administered, 
sterile water will be poured into a polypropylene cup to the approximately 70-80 mL line. Studypersonnel will then slowly (to avoid air bubb les to preserve protein stability) pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] a specified 
volume of thawed PvP001 from the vial and add this to the sterile water. The contents of the cup 
will be gently swirled a few times to mix. Additional sterile water, to a total volume of 100 mL, will be added to the cup and the contents of the cup will again be gently swirled a few times to 
mix. The total volume of PvP001 plus sterile water will be the same (100 mL) for all PvP001 
doses. The volumes of thawed PvP001 and sterile water to achieve each required PvP001 dose in a total volume of 100 mL are shown in Table 9.

Sterile water for dilution of PvP001, for PvP001 placebo, for PvP002 comparator, for preparation 
of the pretreatment buffer solution, and for swallowing Pv P002 and PvP003 will be United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP) for injection with 0 osmolarity.
One gram of PEG 3350 (MiraLAX®; polyethylene glycol 3350 unflavored grit-free powder for 
solution) will be added to and blended with the other ingredients at the time the standardized gluten-containing study meal is prepared and will serve as a marker of total gastric volume. It is 
taste-, preservative-, sugar-, and gluten-free.
8.1.1 Placebo/Comparator Description
The PvP001 placebo will be sterile water. The volume of PvP001 placebo will be 100 mL.
Diluted PvP001 is essentially tasteless and colorless, and the sterile water is tasteless and 
colorless. Therefore, no taste or color masking will be done. PvP001 placebo will be 
administered in a cup that is identical to the cup used to administer PvP001 active treatment.
The PvP002 comparator will be sterile wate r. The volume of PvP002 comparator will be 
100 mL. There is no capsule placebo for PvP002.

Four versions of this standardized blended study meal will be admin istered in this study .
One 
meal is gluten -free (it includes bread that is gluten -free) and will be administered in Part 1 of the 
study  to both healt hy subjects and patients with CeD and in Part 3 of the study  to heal thy 
subjects in Group 4 (Cohorts 3G and 3H) (seeAppendix D). Ano thermeal contains 3g of gluten 
(it includes bread with 3 g of  gluten) and PEG 3350 and will be administered in Part 2 of the 
study  to heal thy subjects in Group 1 (Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 2C) and Group 2 (Cohorts 2D and 2E) 
(seeAppendix E). Another meal contains 1 g of gluten ( it includes bread with 1 g of gluten) and 
PEG 3350 and will be administered in Part 2 of the study  to heal thy subjects in Group 3 (Cohorts 
2F, 2G, and 2H ) and in Part 3 of the study to healthy subjects in Group 1 (Cohorts 3A and 3B) , 
Group 2 (Cohorts 3C and 3D) , Group 3 (Cohorts 3E and 3F) , Group 4 (Cohorts 3G and 3H) , and 
Group 5 (Cohorts 3I and 3J) (seeAppendix F). Another meal contains 6 g of gluten (it includes 
bread with 3 g of gluten as well as 3 g of gluten powder added to the meal ) and PEG 3350 and 
will be administered in Part 2 of the study to healt hy subjects in Group 3 (Cohorts 2I and 2J) (see

Part 1
The obj ective o f Part 1 of thi s study  is to eval uate the safet y of PvP001 and PvP002 admi nistered 
to healt hy subjects and to patients with CeD, rather than to evaluate the gluten -degrading activit y 
of PvP001 and PvP002. Thus, patients with CeD who are on a GFD will be enrolled in this part 
of the study , will  maintain a GFD during study  parti cipation, and will not be challenged wit h a 
gluten-containing m eal. As i t is important to administer the same meal to both healt hy subjects 
and pat ients with CeD, a standardized gluten-free study  meal will be administered to both 
healt hy subjects and pat ients with CeD in this part of the study .
Part 2
The standardized 3 g gluten -containing study meal will be administered to Group 1 and Group 2 
subjects in Part 2 of this study  to eval uate the abilit y of PvP001 and PvP002 to degrade 3 g of 
gluten in healt hy adult subjects. The am ount of  gluten (3 g) in th isstudy  meal was selected based 
on the gl uten degradation capabilities observed under simulated gastric condit ions in the 
laboratory , as discussed in the IB.
The standardized 1 g and 6 g gluten -containing study  mealswill be administered to Group 3 
subjects in Part 2 of this study  to eval uate the abilit y of PvP001 to degrade 1 g of gluten and 6 g 
of gluten in healt hy adult subjects. The amount sof gluten (1 g and 6 g) in th esestudy  meals were
selected base d on the amount of gl uten in the meal in the study  reported by  [CONTACT_24322] 2012 and on 
the gluten degradation capabilit ies observed under simulated gastric condit ions in the laboratory , 
as discussed in the IB.
Part 3
The standardized 1 g gl uten-containing study  meal will be administered to Group 1, Group 2, 
Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5 subjects in Part 3 of this study to evaluate the abilit y of PvP003 
to degrade 1 g of gluten in healt hy adult subjects. (Note: The standardized 1 g gluten -containing 
study  meal administered to Part 3 subjects will be ident ical to the standardized 1 g gluten -
containing meal administered to Part 2 Group 3 subjects.) The am ount of gl uten (1 g) in thi s 
study  meal was selected based on the amount of gluten in the meal in the study reported by  
[CONTACT_24322] 2012 and on the gluten degradation capabilit ies observed under simulated gastric 
condi tions in the laboratory , as discussed in the IB .
The standardized gluten -free study  meal will also be administered to Group 4 subj ects.
Part 4
Nostandardized study meal will be administered to subjects in Part 4 of this study.

solution administration) on the Cohort Treatment Day  to ensure that the subject is free of 
clinically relevant gastrointestinal symptoms. The pre -dose GSQ on the Cohort Treatment Day  
will be considered the baseline GSQ. The subject will co mplete the GSQ post -dose (i.e., after 
completion of study  meal ingestion) at specified time points on the Cohort Treatment Day ,as 
well as at the 24-Hour Safety A ssessment ,to ensure that all gastrointestinal co mplaints are 
reported by  [CONTACT_24362].

Cohort 2C Treatment Day  gastri c pH ≥4, proper placement of the NG tube will be assessed by  
[CONTACT_24366] . The tube will be secured in place on the nose using tape. If incorrect tube 
placement i s suspected (e.g., based on auscultat ion, gastric pH testing, signs, or symptoms), the 
tube will be co mpletely wit hdrawn immediately; placement of the tube may be repe ated at the 
discreti on of  the Investi gator. There will be a minimum wait ing period of approximately 
15minutes after NG tube placement before the next study procedure is performed .
The placement and presence of an NG tube may be associated with a variet y of gastrointestinal 
symptoms. If a gastrointestinal sign or symptom (or other si gn or symptom ) occurs i n associ ation 
with the pl acement or presence of the NG tube, addit ional time may be allowed for it to resolve, 
or to lessen and be stable, such that the Investigator determines that the subject is able to 
continue in the study . If necessary (e.g., a symptom or sign associated with the placement or 
presence of the NG tube is severe) at any time during or after NG tube placement, the NG tube 
will be removed,and the subject will be withdrawn fro m the study .

ongoing.
Chronic/Stable :At the time of last assessment, the event is ongo ing and stabilized, with no 
change to the event outcome anticipated. Record the AE stop date.
Death : The AE direct ly caused death. Record the date of death as the AE stop 
date.
Unknown : There i s an inabilit y toaccess the subject or the subject’s records to 
determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdraws consent or is lost to fo llow

12 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
12.1 Definition of Se rious Adverse Events
AnAE is considered serious if it results in any of the fo llowing outcom es:
Death;
Life-threatening;
Inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24292];
Persi stent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y;
Congenital ano maly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject ; and/or
Other: Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
requi re hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24293], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they  may jeopardi ze the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion. Examples of such 
events include :
oAllergic bronchospasm requiring i ntensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home;
oBlood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]; and
oDevelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.
An AE that does not meet any o f the criteria for seri ousness listed above will be regarded as a 
nonseri ous AE.
If a female subject or a female partner of a male subject beco mes pregnant at any  time fo llowing 
the first dose of study  drug through the 28 ± [ADDRESS_23703] will be withdrawn from the study . Any  
prem ature terminat ions of pregnancy, including elective and/or spontaneous abortions, must be 
reported to the Medical Monitor and designee . The pregnancy will be fo llowed to term. The 
status of the mother and child after delivery must be forwarded to the Medical Monitor and 
designee . Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical trial is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy  com plicati on or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE and will be fo llowed as such. A spontaneous abortion is always 
considered to be an SAE.
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: An AE is life -threatening if it places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event a s it occurred (i.e., it does not include a n event that, had i t occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death ).For example, drug induced hepat itis that resolved

without evi dence of hepat ic failure woul d not be consi dered life threatening, even though drug 
induced hepat itis can be fatal.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: An AE requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24294] d be considered an SAE.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24295]  a pre -exist ing condit ion that has not 
worsened during participat ion in the study  (e.g., elective surgery  for a pre -exist ing condit ion that 
has not worsened), or for a 
routine clinical procedure that isnot the result of an AE need not be 
considered an SAE. If anythinguntoward i s reported during the procedure, that occurrence must 
be reported as an AE, either “serious”or “non- serious ”according to the defined criteria. In 
general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually invo lving at l eastan 
overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24296]/or treatment 
that woul d not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting.
Disabili ty/incapaci ty: An AE is disabling or incapaci tating if the eventresul ts in a substant ial 
disrupt ion of asubject 's abilit y to conduct norm al life f unctions.
12.2 Serious Adverse Event Expectedness
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is 
not listed at the specific ityorseverit y that has been observed .If a serious unexpected AE is 
believed to be related to the study  drug, the Sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  the 
Principal Invest igator participat ing in the clinical trialof the study  drug , as well as the 
appropriate regulatory  authori ties(see Section12.5).
12.[ADDRESS_23704] igator’s receipt of this informat ion. Relevant medical 
records, including, as applicable, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24297], shoul d be obtained by [CONTACT_24385] .
In the event of a fatal or life -threatening SAE, any  requi red inform ation for the init ial report must 
be provided to the Medical Monitor and designee within seven calendar days of the 
Invest igator’s init ial notificat ion of the Medical Monitor and designee . For an SAE that i s not 
fatal or life -threatening, any  required informati on for the init ial report m ust be provi ded to the 
Medical Monitor and designee within [ADDRESS_23705] igator’s init ial notificat ion of 
the Medi cal Monitor and designee .

12.4 Overdose
Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed, and irrespective of whether or not the study
drug was involved) must be reported by [CONTACT_24386] 24 hours of knowledge of the event. An overdose with no associated signs or symptoms will not be classified as an AE or SAE, but should be reported to the Medical 
Monitor and designee. Any signs or symptoms of overdose should be documented as an AE or 
SAE (as applicable); an overdose associated with an SAE should be reported according to the procedures in Section 12.3.
In the case of an overdose, the subject will be monitored closely and managed with supportive 
care. Any symptoms will be treated according to the standard practices of the Investigator and 
the Clinical Research Center.
12.5 Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities
The Sponsor will prepare and submit safety reports (i.e., Investigational New Drug [IND] safety reports) to the FDA, as appropriate, in accordan ce with reporting requirements for SAEs. The 
Sponsor, or its representative, will send copi[INVESTIGATOR_24298].
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_24299], as well as other SAE information per the Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines, to the IRB.
A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting of SAEs, "reasonable possibility" 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.[COMPANY_003]

and Part 4 , as well as the gluten degradat ion abilit y of PvP001 and PvP002 in Part 2 ).In 
addition, in Part [ADDRESS_23714] four subjects would be rando mized to each of the 
six possible gluten am ount, PvP001 dose, and treatment order combinat ions;in Part [ADDRESS_23715] three subjects would be rando mized to 
each of the two possible treatment orders.
Sample size determinat ion and j ustificati on were conducted only  for Part 3 of this study . As 
residual gluten <50 m g is regarded as meaningful in reducing gluten -induced symptoms, the 
sample size calculat ion for Part 3 of th estudy  is based on the proportion of subjects with <50 mg 
residual gluten. For pool ed Part 3 Group 2 and Part 3 Grou p 3, and for Part 3 Group 5, with a 
sample size of 12 (i.e., sixsubjects in G roup 2 and sixsubjects in Group 3), assuming the true 
(popul ation) proporti on is 85%, the 80% exact confidence interval (CI) will be ( 62% ,95%)when 
the observed rate is 83% (10 out of 12 subjects) . Based on the width of this CI, the chosen 
sample size was considered to provide an acceptable level or precisio n in the estimat ion of the

Non-compartmental PK analyses to characterize drug exposure will include, at a minimum, 
determination for each Cohort of maximum plasma concentration, time of maximum plasma 
concentration, terminal half-life, and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 
following the dose administration, derived from the plasma concentration-time data. The AUC will be estimated by [CONTACT_24390]. A ctual times at which blood samples are obtained 
will be used in PK analyses.
Pharmacokinetic parameters and PK concentrations will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. Individual subject concentrations and mean concentrations will be presented 
graphically on the linear scale. Further details will be provided in the SAP.

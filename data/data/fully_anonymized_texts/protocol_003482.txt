Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common, sy stemic autoimmune inflammat ory disease, 
characterized b y synovial inflammation leading to pain, swelling, stiffness, and progressive 
destruction and deformity of small and large joints. Pati ents experience impaired ph ysical 
function, social participation, and health -related quality  of life. Patients also have increased 
risk of significant comorbidities that are not musculoskeletal. For RA, therapeutic options 
currentl y available include conve ntional s ynthetic disease -modify ing anti
-rheumatic drugs 
(cDMARDs), biological DMARDs (bDMARD s), and targeted -synthetic DMARDs 
(tsDMARDs). Strategies have been developed to treat RA b y inhibiting Janus kinase (JAK) 
pathway s and the first JAK inhibitor appr oved for the treatment of RA in the U.S. was 
tofacitinib (Xeljanz®; [COMPANY_007]; November 2012).[ADDRESS_800926]  over an extended period of time, JAK inhibition by  [CONTACT_604767] a 
pattern of partial and reversible inhibition of the intracellular effects from several 
inflammatory  cytokines. Tofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the JAK famil y of 
kinases with a high degree of selectivity  relative to other kinases in the human genome.
As a commitment to the US FDA, [COMPANY_007] conducted the ORAL Surveillance Study  
(A3921133) ,2a post -authorization safety  study  (PASS). A3921133 evaluated the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and malignancies exclu ding non- melanoma 
skin cancer (NMSC) with tofacitinib (5 and 10 mg BID) versus TNFi in patients with 
moderatel y or severely active RA who had an inadequate response to methotrexate and who 
were [ADDRESS_800927] 1 additional cardiov ascular (CV) risk factor. In 
February  2019, a safet y analy sis of ongoing study , A3921133, reported the frequency  of 
pulmonary  embolism and all -cause mortality in patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID was 
higher than in patients treated with a TNFi. On 2 6July 2019, the FDA approved new 
warnings about an increased risk of blood clots and death with the 10 mg twice dail y dose of 
tofacitinib, which was only  approved for ulcerative colitis (UC). Use of the 10 mg twice 
daily  dose became limited bey ond the ind uction phase. The approved use of JAKi for UC 
also became limited to patients who demonstrated inadequate response or intolerance to one 
or more TNF blockers.
In January  2021, in the final anal ysis of ORAL Surveillance, for the combined tofacitinib 
doses 
(5 and 10 mg BID) versus TNFi, non -inferiority  was not shown for either adjudicated 
MACE or adjudicated malignancies (excluding NMSC). I n December 2021, a JAKi class 
label
extended the post- TNFi restriction to all gastroenterological and rheumatologic indi cations
for all future approved JAKi in the U S. These findings also led to a review by  [CONTACT_23357], not 
resulting in a change in the line of therap y, but a limitation of the use of JAKi in certain 
patient sub- populations (only  be used if no suitable treatment alterna tives are available in 
patients: 65 y ears of age and older; patients with history  of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease or other cardiovascular risk factors (such as current or past long -time smokers);

Page 10of 27patients with malignancy risk factors (eg, current malignancy  or history  of malignancy ).
Though the efficacy  and safet y profile of tofacitinib has been established in prior randomized 
controlled trials ,3,4,5the real -world effectiveness of tofacitinib in routine care settings 
compared to frequentl y used bDMARDs is lacking. The evidence from prior RCTs is limited 
by [CONTACT_604768] y small sizes and due to strict eligibility  criteria, which reduces the 
generalizability  of the results. For example, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of 
tofacitinib compared to individual agents such as abatacept and within clinically  relevant 
subgroups such as patients with prior use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). The 
majority  of the RCT populations required background use of methotrexate and excluded 
patients who were treated with other bDMARDs. Though there are some studies of 
tofacitinib using real- world data ,6-9they tend to be limited by  [CONTACT_19462], and primarily  
focused on safet y outcomes with limited research on effectiveness outcomes such as clinical 
disease activity .10,11The purpose of this study is to evaluate the real- world effectiveness of 
patients treated with tofacitinib compared to other select bDMARD in relation to indicated
use according to the FDA12and EMA labels,13as well as within rel evant subgroups 
harnessing data from the US based OM1 PremiOM™ RA dataset (OM1, Inc., [LOCATION_011], MA).

9.3.Variables
9.3.1. Exposures
The study  cohorts will be constructed using a new -user, active comparator desig n14as three 
pairwise comparisons between tofacitinib initiators and initiators of a comparator medication. 
Treatment initiation will be defined as no use of the study medication at any  time prior to 
cohort entry (For example, a tofacitinib initiator will be required to have no tofacitinib use 
prior to cohort entry , however they  are allowed to use other medications). The start date of a 
patient’s b/tsDMARD will be termed the cohort entry date (also known as index date or time

9.3.3. Patient Follow -Up
Patients will be followed up for outcomes within their pre -defined outcome assessment 
windows. Outcomes will be examined at two timepoints: an outcome assessment window of 
135-225 day s (ie, 180±45) after the cohort entry  date; and a window of 320- 410 day s 
(ie,365± 45) after the cohort entry  date. Patient follow -up will begin 1 day  after cohort entry  
and will end at the occurrence of an outcome or a censoring event: 1) if they  discontinue their 
index treatment, 2) switch to a different ts/bDMARD, 3) are lost to follow -up, or 4) on the 
last day  of the outcome assessment window for each anal ysis, whichever comes first.
9.3.4. Outcomes
The primary  outcome for this study  will be a documented (y es/no) improvement or 
maintenance (depending on the patients’ baseline CDAI  score) in disease activity  defined as 
a first record of low disease activit y/remission whi ch corresponds to a CDA I score lesser 
than or equal to 10.[ADDRESS_800935] of censoring (e g, due to treatment discontinuation or switch) on the 
relationship between treatment and the event of interest. Further explanation is provided in

9.4.Data Sources 
A retrospective design will be used to explore the comparative effectiveness of tofacitinib 
among a cohort ofpatients with RA in the U.S. using the OM1 PremiOM™ RA dataset 
(OM1, Inc., [LOCATION_011], MA). This dataset of over 244,[ADDRESS_800936]’s EMR provider 
systems geographicall y representative of the U.S. population. The EMR data include 
encounters, medication history  and prescription information, laboratory  results, PROs, and 
clinical observations as documented b y a rheumatologist. Additional medical and pharmacy 
claims data co ntaining coding history  on inpatient and outpatient en counters from clinics, 
acute care facilities, or ambulatory  surgical centers are linked to the clinical data described 
above to fill information gaps in patients’ clinical care. At the time of analysis, the OM1 
PremiOM™ RA dataset covered the time period f rom 01 January  2013 through 
31December 2023.
9.5.Study Size
The sample size is not determined based on a formal statistical power analysis. Preliminary  
feasibility  anal yses indicated a sample size range o f approximately  10,705 patients with RA 
with a prescri ption of tofacitinib in the OM1 dataset, and 44,595 patients with a prescription 
for a b/tsDMARD other than tofacitinib. Sample size will not be fully  determined until all 
eligibility  criteria are appli ed.
9.6.Data Management 
To ensure the quality  and integri ty of research, this study  will be conducted under the 
Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_16084] (GPP) issued by  [CONTACT_941] I nternational 
Society  for Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (ISPE), the principles outlin ed in the Belmont Report 
(Ethical Principles and Guide lines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research), and 
any applicable national guidelines. Following these best practices, OM1 has standard 
operating procedures including internal quality  audits, rules for secure and confidential data, 
methods to mai ntain and archive project documents, quality -control procedures for 
programming, and standards for writing analy sis plans.

Statistical analy sis of this study  will be the responsibility  ofOM1, Inc., with review and 
approval b y [COMPANY_007]. Anychange to the data anal ysis methods described in this study  protocol 
will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the study  protocol. Any  
other changes to the data anal ysis methods described in the study  protocol and the 
justification for making the changes will be described in the study  report or equivalent 
document. Anal ysis datasets will be prepared by  [CONTACT_604769] y Language (SQL). Data 
analysis will be performed using R or SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.), 
Version 9.4.
Continuous variables will be summarized by  [CONTACT_8477] (standard deviation [SD]) and median 
(Q1, Q3). Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_604770] . Depending on the dist ribution of data, very  small categories (for example, 
<5patients) may  be combined with a larger category  for easier interpretation. The 
denominator for the percentages will be the number of p atients with non- missing data. The 
number of patients with missi ng data will be presented, but these patients will not be 
included in the denominator in the calculation of percentages. 
9.7.1. Objective 1: Real -World Comparative Effectiveness of Tofacitinib in Ne w 
Initiators of Select bDMARDs
Statistical analysis:
Objective 1 will aim to assess the comparative effectiveness of tofacitinib initiators vs 
bDMARDs in achieving low disease activity  as assessed b y CDAI score. 
We will use inverse probability  of treatme nt weighting (IP TW) using stabilized weights15to 
adjust for baseline confounders. Patients will be weighted b y the inverse probability  of the 
treatment they  actually  received .Fortofacitinib initiators the I P
TW will be = 1/propensity  
score (PS), whereas ,for the comparator medication the I PTW will be = 1/(1 -PS). 
Stabilization will be done by  [CONTACT_604771] y of the treatment th ey 
actuall y received in the numerator of the weights.16Other weighting methods such as overlap 
weights17,18will be considered as an alternat iveif IPTW leads to extreme weights despi[INVESTIGATOR_604764] . Overlap weights are a weighting analogue of PS matching that targets an 
estimand similar to PS matching b y standardizing the covariate distribution to those patients 
where there is overlap of the PS distributions. For each patient, the overlap weight will be 
calculated as the probability  of receiving the opposite treatment (or the treatment they  didn’t 
receive) . For tofacitinib initiators the overlap weight will be =(1 - PS), whereas, for a 
compara tor medication the overlap weight will be = (PS).
The propensit y score will be estimated (separatel y in the three pairwise cohorts) using 
logistic regression as the predicted probability  of initiating tofacitinib vs. the comparator 
medication as a functio n of the baseline covariates. Baseline patient characteristics before 
and after 
weighting will be tabulate d,and covariate balance will be assessed using

cohort using Cox regression with robust standard errors to account for the weighting. Two 
timepoints will be examined: an outcome a ssessment window of 135 -225 day s (ie, 180 ± 45) 
after the coh ort entry  date; and an outcome assessment window of 320- 410 day s after the 
cohort entry  date. 
Reasons for censoring will be reported separatel y for each exposure group and potential bias 
due to censoring will be evaluated and may  be addressed analy tically using inverse 
probability  of censoring weights (I PCW) . Additional s ensitivity  anal yses may  be conducted 
to further examine an y bias due to censoring/loss -to-follow -up that may  be associated with
the exposure. This may  include methods such as bias anal ysiswith imputation of extreme 
values for missing outcome data, or intention to treat anal yses (ie
, not censoring at switch).
9.7.2. Objective 2: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Assessing the Comparative
Effectiveness of Tofacitinib vs. bDMARDS
In objective 2, an alyses from objective [ADDRESS_800938] ratios (95% CI s) will be reported within predefined subgroups 
from the overall weighted population in each of the three cohorts. Thus, it will be assumed 
thatthe PS generated across the entire cohort is also valid for the subgroups.20The 
pre-defined subgroups include the following; however, the final subgr oups will be 
determined after running feasibility  checks to ensure adequate sample size. 
Age ( ≥65 vs. <65; ≥ 50 vs. <50)
Sex 
Disease duration (categorical, at least 2 years versus less than 2 y ears)
Obesity  (≥30 kg/m2 vs. <30 kg/m2at value closest to index)
Baseline disease activity  (CDAI >10 versus CDAI<=10 )
Number of documented prior b/tsDMARD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( ≥2vs.<2, ≥1vs.< 1 )
Rheumatoid factor (“RF”) status (positive, negative/unknown), in patients with Rh 
status available, if sa mple size allows
Anti- CCP status (positive, negative/unknown)
CRP level (closest to baseline, categorical <3 mg/L vers us ≥3 mg/L)

&[ADDRESS_800939] Quality  control ( QC)checks on the raw data (from the 
sources) as well as the processed data received. As the data goes through a series of 
normalization, harmonization, and enrichment processes , it is subjected to a se ries of 
industry -standard data quality  checks which are further augmented with additional 
OM1 -defined data quality  checks whereby  [CONTACT_604772] O M1’s Clinical I nformatics and 
Research groups. Based on the findings within these checks, additional processing and 
resolution steps are implemented, and the steps are repeated. These steps are repeated until 
there are no data quality  issues identified dur ing these checks. These Q C checks follow 
standard dimensions of quality , such as fidelity  of the data through completeness and 
correctness, representativeness, validity , usabilit y, and fit -for-use of the data. Additional 
quality  checks are then performed when end points are defined and programmed to ensure 
validity , correctness, accuracy , and conformit y to the study  requirements. 
OM1 performs deduplication on the data received through disparate data sources as part of 
processing whereb y redundant patient r ecords are removed from the OM1’s Real -World Data 
Cloud, preventing fragmented and duplicated data points and records from being 
incorporated into the Cloud and ensuring that the most updated and accurate patient 
information is processed and represented in OM1's data.
9.9.Limitations of the Research Methods
The employment of real -world health history  data for anal ysis may  be subject to issues of 
missingness or incomplete data capture, compounded by  [CONTACT_604773] m isclassification.

Version 1.[ADDRESS_800940] a CDAI<10, will not be captured in 
our st udy. Some patients may  also be lost to follow -upbefore the pre -defined outcome 
assessment windows which may  lead to some under -ascertainment of actual outcomes. If this 
under -ascertainment is differential, then there is the potential that the study  results may  be 
impacted b y a substantial bias either t owards or away  from the null. If a treatment is 
ineffective in a given patient and that treatment is discontinued prior to measurement of 
outcomes, removal of patients for whom the treatment is ineffective could induce substantial 
bias where only patients who do well on treatment are included in the anal ysis. I t is possible 
that a drug that has no effect on the outcome could appear beneficial because only patients 
who benefit from the drug are included in the analy sis of outcomes. Sensitivity  anal yses 
(such as, but not limited to, intent to treat anal ysis, where patients are not censored at 
treatment switch or discontinuation) and examination of assumptions of non-differential loss-
to follow -up will be required for the results to hav e a useful interpretation . 
Another 
source of bias that may affect results if outcome measurement is related to the 
assessor’s knowledge of the patient’s condition. For example, if a ph ysician believes the 
patient will have a poor CDAI  score (or a very  good CDAI  score), they  may  be less likely  to 
perform that assessment. This phenomenon could bias results either towards or away  from 
the null. Further sensitivity  analy ses will be needed to quantify  the potential impact of this 
bias, where the assumptions aro und lack of measurement at the time point of interest are 
examined . However, if the censoring process is sufficiently  captured by  [CONTACT_604774], then such bias can be mitigated 
using IPCW. 
The study  population includ es patie nts with CDAI scores ≤10 at baseline who may  be more 
likely  to experience the study  outcome and the proportion of these patients may  be different 
across exposure groups. To account for this, baseline CDAI scores will be inclu ded as a 
covariate to estimate the PS to ensure balance on this variable. Further, stratified anal yses 
will be conducted (sample- size permitting) b y baseline CDAI score. 
Finally , treatment effects reported in stratified analy ses conducted as part of Objec tive2 
should be interpreted wi th caution as these anal yses will likely  be limited by  [CONTACT_19462].

Phase 2 
Sponsor KalVista Pharmaceuticals Ltd 
Study Centr e(s) Multiple clinical sites in Europe and US 
Objectives Primary O bjective: 
• To investigate the efficacy of KVD900 compared to placebo in halting the progression of a peripheral or abdominal attack of hereditary angioedema (HAE ). 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To investigate the safety and tolerability of KVD900. 
• To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of KVD900 when taken during the intercritical period between HAE attacks. 
• To investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of KVD900 in reducing the concentration of residual cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (HK) during the intercritical period between 
HAE attack s. 
• To investigate the PD profile of KVD900 in reducing activated plasma enzyme activity during the intercritical period between HAE attack s. 
Note: Subjects enrolled at US study sites will not contribute data for PK and PD analysis. 
Setup This is a phase 2, two -part, two-sequence, two-period (2x2) cross -over 
clinical trial: Subjects with HAE type I or II will be recruited through HAE 
treatment centre s in Europe and US. 
In Part 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg KVD900 to 
investigate the safety of KVD900 during the intercritical period between HAE attack s. 
Eligible adult subjects ≥18 years old will undergo a screening assessment 
for study inclusion, receive study drug, followed by a 4h , in-clinic, safety 
assessmen t. 
In Part 2, the subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1081998] from the clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
In Sequence 1 (study arm 1) subjects will receive a single dose of [ADDRESS_1081999] eligible HAE attack . Following resolution of this 
attack, subjects will receive a second single dose of placebo to treat the second eligible HAE attack .

KVD900-201 CONFIDENTIAL 
In Sequence 2 (study arm 2) subjects will receive a single dose of placebo 
to treat the first eligible HAE attack . Following resolution of this attack, 
subjects will receive a second single dose of [ADDRESS_1082000] substantial meal prior to dosing. Subjects will take study drug, as 
instructed, and will complete timed assessments of their HAE attack 
symptoms for a 48h period as documented below in Table 1 (S). The 
dedicated study physician or qualified designee will contact [CONTACT_49880] 24h of the eligible HAE attack to confirm the subject’s safety and wellbeing. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_786590] . In the case 
of hypersensitivity, subjects are to contact [CONTACT_786591]. The 
dedicated study physician or qualified designee will be available 24h/day 
and 7 days/week to receive subject calls.

Final, Version 5.3 Sample Size: 
A samp le size of approx imate ly 50 subjects (25 per sequence ) is proposed 
to provide 90% power for testing at the 5% alpha level (2-sided) for the 
primary endpoint of time to use of conventional attack treatment within 12h 
of stud dru . 
1 1 • imate ly 60 
subjects will be enrolled to ensu re that approximately 50 subjects 
comp lete the study . 
An oversampling by 20% (10 subjects) is proposed to account for subjects 
that may not complete both treatment periods due to infrequent or 
ineligib le HAE attacks or for subjects who discont inue the trial early, for 
whatever reason . Thus , study enrolment will be cons idered sufficient to 
address the primary efficacy hypothes is after approximate ly [ADDRESS_1082007] not comp leted both periods will be asked to return to the study site 
and comp lete Visit 4 (Early Discontinuation visit). Data from all subjects, 
comp lete and incomplete, will be analyzed in the safety set. 
Gene ral Cons iderations: 
Individual subject data will be presented in subject data listings. 
Approp riate descr iptive statistics will be calculated for continuous and 
categor ical data and summar ized in tabular format. 
Safety Analyses : 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activ ities (MedDRA ) dictionary (v21.0 or higher ) and class ified by 
[CONTACT_82523] (SOC ). Listings of treatment-
emergent adve rse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing 
prematu re discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570], and furthe r 
classified by [CONTACT_786596] . 
Efficacy Analyses:

compare the treatment arms. 
Secondary and explo ratory endpoints, using time to event as the unit of 
analysis, will be analyzed using a similar approach to that used for the 
primary endpo int.

Note: Subjects enrolled at US study sites will not contribute data for PK 
and PD analysis. 
PK Analysis: 
Non-compartmental PK parameters will include, but are not limited to, 
maximum concentration in plasma (C max), time to reach C max in plasma 
(tmax), area under the curve from time [ADDRESS_1082008] measurable concentration 
(AUC 0-t), apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution 
(Vd/F) and estimated terminal elimination half-life (t ½). 
The PK parameters of KVD900 will be determined from the individual 
concentration versus time data using Phoenix WinNonlin. In case of a 
deviation from the theoretical time, the actual time of blood sample will be 
used in the calculation of the derived PK parameters. Individual concentrations and derived PK parameters of KVD900 in plasma will be listed and summarized for each treatment. Individual and geometric mean concentration-time data will be plotted on linear and semi -logarithmic 
scales. 
PD Analysis: 
KVD900’s effect on plasma kallikrein (PKa) activity will be analyzed using 
two exploratory measures of PKa enzyme activity in plasma: 
• An assay to determine inhibition of exogenously activated plasma 
kallikrein enzyme activity from plasma samples obtained before and 
after receiving KVD900. 
• An assay to measure the level of protection of cleavage of high 
molecular weight kininogen (HK) substrate (contained in whole plasma) from plasma kallikrein enzyme activity . 
The PD will be summarized for each treatment. Individual and mean data will be provided as a report addendum located in the appendix of the final Clinical Study Report.

1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Clinical Study Protocol 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE ) is a rare genetic disease character ized by [CONTACT_484787][INVESTIGATOR_786580]-p itting edema that can affect any cutaneous or mucosa ! surface. Swelling of the face, 
larynx , tongue , extremities , stomach, bowels, and genitals is common and can be associated 
with significant morb idity and morta lity. The most common form of HAE is autosoma l dominant 
and results from a loss-of-funct ion mutation in the gene that codes for C1 inhibitor protein. 
Unde r normal circumstances, a funct ional level of C1 inhibitor in plasma prevents over-
activation of the complement system and over-product ion of the vasoactive mediator , 
bradykin in. Deficiency of C1 inhib itor allows for excess ive release of bradyk inin and comp lement 
anaphylatoxins , which results in increased endothe lial permeabil ity and edema (Kaplan and 
Joseph , 2017 ). 
1.1 Rationale for the Study 
Bradykinin is formed by [CONTACT_243341] a protease enzyme , plasma kallikre in (PKa), on a 
precursor molecule, kininogen , leading to the release of active bradyk inin into the circu lation. In 
the absence of C1 inhib itor (as is the case in HAE ), excess ive bradykinin activ ity trigge rs the 
HAE attacks. It is therefore logical to target PKa as a treatment strategy in HAE. 
It is therefore a plausible hypothes is that treatment with a single dose of KVD900 [ADDRESS_1082017] igator 's Brochure (1B) for further detai l on KVD900 .

The two-part design of the current study has been chosen in order to confi rm under open-label, 
clinic-superv ised conditions (Part 1) that admin istration of a single [ADDRESS_1082019] a positive benefit-r isk balance given that: 
I 
I Inhibition of plasma kallikrein is not a novel mechanism for the treatment of HAE . There are 
current ly approved plasma kallikre in inhib itors that do not have known target-re lated AEs. 
-The initial dose of KVD900 600 mg will be taken in the clinic under the supervision of the 
Investiga tor. 
-The dose of KVD90 0 to be taken in Part 2 (away from the clinic or hosp ital) will only be 
taken once a study phys ician or qualified designee has confi rmed the HAE attack to be 
eligible and, importantly , that it is not a laryngea l or facial attack. In this case , subjects will 
treat immediate ly with their conventiona l attack treatment (pdC1 INH or rhC1 INH 
intravenous [iv] or icatibant ). The dedicated study physician or qualified designee will also 
contact [CONTACT_2690] 24h of the eligible HAE attack to confirm the subject's safety and 
wellbeing . Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_786597]. In the case of hypersens itivity, subjects are to 
contact [CONTACT_786598]. The dedicated study phys ician or qualified designee will be available

Final , Version 5.3 28 of 72   24 November  2020  3 OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY  
 Overview  
This is a phase 2, randomized, two -part, two-sequence, two-period (2x2) cross -over clinical trial 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of KVD900 compared to placebo in halting the 
progression of a peripheral or abdominal attack in adult subjects with HAE  type I or II. 
Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled into the study  to ensure approximately 50 subjects 
complete the study . 
The study will be in two parts  with the same cohort of subjects completing both parts  (Figure 1). 
In Part 1 , subjects will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg KVD900 to investigate the safety  of 
KVD900 during the intercritical period between HAE  attack s. Eligible adult subjects ≥18 y ears 
old will undergo a screening assessment for study inclusion, receive study drug, followed by a 
4h, in-clinic, safety assessment. 
In Part 2 , the subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1082020] from the clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
In Sequence 1 (study arm 1) subjects will receive a single dose of [ADDRESS_1082021] eligible HAE attack . Following resolution of this attack, subjects will receive a second single 
dose of placebo to treat the second eligible HAE  attack . 
In Sequence 2 (study arm 2) subjects will receive a single dose of placebo to treat the first 
eligible HAE attack . Following resolution of this attack, subjects will receive a second single 
dose of [ADDRESS_1082022] is likely to be approximately 
19 weeks.  
The study schedule of events will be as follows:  
Screening Phase (Visit 1) : The screening period will be up to 28 days. All subjects will sign an 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any study related procedures being performed. Subjects 
will be [ADDRESS_1082023] a diagnosis of HAE type  I 
or II. 
Part 1  (Visit 2) : On the day of first study drug administration the subject’s eligibility will be 
reconfirmed and baseline assessments will be performed. Eligible subjects will receive a single 
oral dose of KVD900 600 mg. Vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood 
pressure [DBP], pulse rate [PR] , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  [RR] and body temperature) will be measured 
at pre-dose (0h), 1h, and 4h post-dose. Samples for post-treatment safety laboratory 
assessments will be taken at 4h post-dose. 
Part 2 : This will be conducted away from the clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Laryngeal or facial attacks are 
not eligible for treatment. Eligible HAE attack s must be treated within the first hour of onset and 
before reaching severe on the global attack severity scale. Subjects must also be able to 
identify the start of an HAE  attack. Upon onset of the HAE  attack , subjects will notify the 
dedicated study physician or qualified designee with a description of the HAE attack  symptoms. 
The dedicated study physician or qualified designee will confirm  eligibility of the HAE attack  and 
agree to study drug being administered. HAE  attack s require documentation, on the Subject 
Diary , of attack location, attack symptoms, time of onset, attack severity , and time of last 
substantial meal  prior to dosing prior to dosing. Subjects will take study drug, as instructed, and 
will complete timed assessments of their HAE attack symptoms for a 48h period following study 3.[ADDRESS_1082024]'s safety and 
wellbe ing. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_786599] . In the case of hypersens itivity, subjects are to contact 
[CONTACT_786600]. 
The dedicated study physician or qualified designee will be available 24h/day and 7 days /week 
to receive subject calls. 
Subjects will return to the clinic (Visit 3) following the first eligible HAE attack, prior to the 
second eligible HAE attack , to unde rgo safety checks including AE reporting, vital sign 
record ing, and Subject Diary review. 
End of study visit (Visit 4): Once two eligib le HAE attacks have been treated in Part 2, the 
subject will return to the clinic to undergo final safety checks including AE report ing, vital sign 
record ing and blood samp ling for laboratory safety measu rements. 
Early Discontinuation: If any subject discont inues the trial early, (i.e. before having treated two 
eligible HAE attacks within Part 2) every effort shou ld be made to comp lete Visit 4 (Early 
Discontinuat ion visit) as soon as possible and, wheneve r possib le, prior to starting any new 
medicat ion or treatment. All attempts will be made to avoid early discontinuat ion 
Study Termination: A samp le size of approx imate ly 50 subjects comp leting both treatment 
periods (25 per sequence ) is proposed to provide 90% power for testing at the 5% alpha level 
(2-sided) for the rima end oint of time to use of convent ional attack treatment within 12h of 
stud dru .

sample size. 
An oversampling by 20% (10 subjects) is proposed to account for subjects that may not 
complete both treatment periods due to infrequent or ineligib le HAE attacks or for subjects who 
discontinue the trial early, for whateve r reason . Thus , study enrolment will be cons idered 
sufficient to address the primary efficacy hypothes is after approx imate ly [ADDRESS_1082025] not completed both periods will be asked 
to return to the study site and comp lete Visit 4 (Early Discontinuat ion visit). Data from all 
subjects, complete and incomplete , will be analyzed in the safety set. 
Conventional Attack Treatment: Conventiona l attack treatment is permitted after 4h, or earlier 
as warranted , following study drug intake, provided HAE attack symptoms are judged severe 
enough by [CONTACT_786601]'s usua l treatment regimen , or are 
associated with laryngea l or facia l symptoms . Prior to use of conventiona l attack treatment, 
subjects will notify the dedicated study phys ician or qualified designee who will confirm 
convent ional attack treatment is appropriate per protoco l and subject report of symptom 
sever ity. Subjects are permitted to treat their HAE attacks with their conventional attack 
treatment (pdC1 INH or rhC1 INH iv or icatibant ).

form (eCRF ), provided that subject consent has not been withdrawn. 
4.3.4 Withdrawal Procedures 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will complete Visit 4 as soon as possible 
(Section 7.2.4). The reason for di scontinuation / withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF and 
the Medical M onitor must be informed immediately. If the reason for withdrawal is the 
occurrence of an AE, the subject will be followed up until the AE has resolved or is considered 
chronic and stable or the AE has been clearly shown to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Withdrawn subjects  will not be replaced; screening / randomization codes of withdrawn subjects 
will not be reused.

KVD900-[ADDRESS_1082037] will receive a unique screening identification  (ID) number. Subjects who are 
screen failures and are not randomized will retain their screening ID number. 
4.5.2 Randomization Scheme 
Subjects  will be randomized on a 1 :1 basis to the two sequences for Part 2 (KVD900 600 mg 
followed by [CONTACT_786605]900 600 mg) .  
4.5.3 Allocation / Randomization of Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects must not be randomized unless all eligibility criteria have been met. 
Subjects who satisfy all the entry criteria will be assigned to a treatment sequence according to 
the randomization scheme . Each randomized subject will receive a unique randomization 
number. Subjects will be randomized in a 1 :1 ratio to Sequence 1 (KVD900 followed by 
[CONTACT_14296]) or Sequence 2 (placebo followed by [CONTACT_611130]900) .  
The actual treatment sequence for each subject will be determined by [CONTACT_109721]. The randomization scheme will be produced by a computer software program  that 
incorporates a standard procedure for generating randomization numbers.  
The randomization scheme will inform the Investigator of the kit ID number to be allocated to the 
subject. The first dose of study drug will be the open label single 600 mg oral dose comprised of 6 x 
KVD900 100 mg Film Coated Tablet s administered in the clinic during Part 1, after completion 
of all pre– dose assessments. 
Randomized subjects who are discontinued (Section 4.3) from further study drug administration 
or are terminated from the study for any reason, regardless of whether study drug was taken or 
not, will not have their screening / randomization code be reused. 4.4

 Blinding and Breaking the Blind 
Part 2 of the study will be performed in a double –blind manner. 
The study  blind should not be broken except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of the 
study drug received would affect the treatment of the emergency) or regulatory requirement1 
(e.g., for SAEs or death). The subject’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded. The decision to break the study 
blind will be made solely by [CONTACT_737].  
Before breaking the blind  of an individual subject’s treatment, the Investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the s tudy 
drug, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_180806].  
Following the unblinding of the study drug for a subject, the Investigator should inform the 
Sponsor  and Medical Monitor . In addition to this, the date, time, and reason for unblinding must 
be recorded in the subject’s eCRF system , and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject, is unblinded, the subject 
must be listed as major protocol deviation.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), which are subject to expedited 
reporting, should be unblinded before submission to the Regulatory Authorities . 
The overall randomization code will be broken only for reporting purposes. This will occur once 
all final clinical data have been entered onto the database and all data queries have been resolved, and the assignment of subject to the analysis sets has been completed. 
 Drug Accountability 
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining accurate study drug accountability records 
throughout the study.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for verifying accurate delivery of the study drug and 
acknowledging receipt thereof by [CONTACT_786607]. A copy will be retained for the Investigator Site File.  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accountability records that must document all study 
drug received from the Sponsor, dispensed (as per the protocol  / amendment[s]) to the subjects , 
returned by [CONTACT_748] , and returned to the Sponsor  or sent for destruction (following Sponsor 
approval) . In addition to this, the accountability records will document any additional relevant 
information received by [CONTACT_786608].  
Records should include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], and any unique code numbers assigned to the study drug and / or subjects . 
The Investigator or designee will dispense the study drug only to the identified subjects of this 
study following the procedures described in this study protocol and documented in the subject dispensing log.

is mandatory. 
Subjects will be instructed to return all unused study drug and packaging to the clinic at their 
subsequent visits (Visits  3 and 4). 
All drug accountability forms will be routinely reviewed by [CONTACT_786609] (CRA).  
The site staff should aim to follow up on the reasons for any missing study drug or other 
discrepancies noted after performing the relevant study drug accountability.  
Study drug that has been dispensed to a subject  and returned unused must not be re -dispensed 
for a different subject. Unused study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the 
present study.  
After completion of the study  and following Sponsor approval, all unused study drug will either 
be returned to the Sponsor or sent for destruction within [ADDRESS_1082040] dose.  
 Compliance 
In Part 1, study drug administration and dispensing procedures shall be conducted by [CONTACT_786610]; study drug administration must be recorded in the source data and

concomitant medications are defined as those medications started after first administration of study drug at Visit [ADDRESS_1082041]’s usual treatment regimen, or are deemed ineligible for study drug 
treatment, or are associated with laryngeal or facial symptoms. Subjects are permitted to treat their HAE attack s with their conventional attack  treatment (pdC1INH or rhC1INH iv or icatibant) . 
Subjects will attempt to contact [CONTACT_786611]. The dedicated study physician or qualified designee should 
confirm that conventional attack treatment is appropriate per the protocol and HAE  attack  
severity. Should the subject be unable to reach their study physician or qualified designee prior 
to taking conventional attack treatment, subjects may take t heir conventional  attack treatment 
as needed. Time to use of conventional attack treatment will be entered in the subject diary .  
Note: In the event a subject receives treatment with C1INH or icatibant (all doses) during the

 Safety Variables 
Safety variables of interest in this study are:  
• AEs , including SAEs . 
• Laboratory test results (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis)  
• Vital signs (SBP, DBP, PR, RR and body temperature). 
• Physical examination findings . 
• ECG  results . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1082043] importance that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure compliance with reporting of AEs from his/her site.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an I MP in 
humans, whether or not considered I MP-related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the IMP 
(e.g. off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184] / or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate pages of the e CRF. 6.[ADDRESS_1082044] be 
recorded.  
Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal assessments (e.g., physical examination, vital 
signs, etc.) that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat 
[confirmatory] test) should be reported as AEs  (unless they are associated with an already 
reported clinical event). 
 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_590218]  / her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the event and 
should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the 
subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities. 
• Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug should be determined by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator using 
these explanations:  
• Suspected: A reasonable possibility exists that the study drug caused the AE. 
• Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the study drug caused the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the AE . “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the study drug  and the AE 
include: A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with study drug exposure (e.g. hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); one or more 
occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with study drug exposure, but is 
otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the study drug (e.g., tendon rupture); an 
aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the study drug-sequence group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the study drug using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the IB  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed.  
• Expected: An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  [IP_ADDRESS]

Final , Version 5.3 45 of 72   24 November  2020  AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological  / mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected.  
The Investigator  should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is 
subject to the Sponsor ’s determination. 
 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor , it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death. 
• A life-threatening AE. 
Note : An AE is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor , its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].

Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_786583].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly  / birth defect.  
• Important medical events. 
Note: Important medical events may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_786584], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
 Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs which occur from the time of signing of the ICF up to and including Visit 4  / Early 
Discontinuation, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, relationship to the study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].

Final , Version 5.3 58 of 72   24 November  2020  8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
The statistical considerations in this section summarize the plan for data analysis of this study. 
Before unblinding, a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized, providing detailed 
methods for the analyses outlined below. The SAP will supersede the protocol in the case of 
any inconsistencies between the two documents. Any deviations from the planned analyses described in the SAP will be described and justified in the final Clinical  Study Report. 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 sequence groups  for Part  2: KVD900 
[ADDRESS_1082062]-randomization will 
also be summarized. 
8.1.2 Protocol Deviations 
Deviations from the protocol  including violations of inclusion / exclusion criteria will be assessed 
as “minor” or “major” in cooperation with the Sponsor. Major deviations from the protocol that have the potential to impact the efficacy results will lead to the exclusion of a subjec t from the 
Per Protocol  Set (PPS). Deviations will be defined prior to unblinding.  
8.1.3 Analysis Sets  
Analysis sets are defined as follows:  
• Safety set (SAF): Subjects who have taken at least one dose of study drug (incl uding the 
study drug dose in Part 1) . 
• Full analysis set (for efficacy) (FAS): All r andomized subjects who received both dose s 
of study drug in Part 2. 
• Per protocol set (for efficacy) (PPS): R andomized subjects in Part [ADDRESS_1082063] no major protocol deviations.  
• PK / PD analysis  set: All subjects for whom PK  / PD samples were taken in Part 1. 
(Note: Subjects enrolled at US study sites will not contribute data for PK and PD analysis.)  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS. A  secondary analysis will also be 
performed based upon the PPS unless the FAS and PPS are the same. All safety analyses will 
be based upon the SAF. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be evaluated for the SAF, FAS and for the PP S. If 
one or more subject( s) received incorrect trial drug, these data will also be presented for the 
SAF. 8.1

 General Considerations 
All statistical tests will be two -sided and will be performed at the 5% level of significance, unless 
otherwise stated. Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_21753] (number, arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). 
Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_310184] (frequencies 
and percent ages). 
All analyses will be carried out using SAS Version 9.4 or higher  or using other validated 
software. 
Analysis and data conventions:  
Definition of baseline  
The baseline assessment will be the latest, valid pre-dose assessment available for each dose 
in Part 1 and Part 2. 
Unscheduled assessments  
Extra assessments (laboratory data or vital signs associated with non-protocol clinical visits or 
obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs ) will be included in listings, but not 
summaries. If more than one laboratory value is available for a given visit, the first valid observation will be used in summaries and all observations will  be presented in listings. It is 
noted that invalid laboratory data may not be used (from hemolyzed samples, mishandled 
samples, quantity not sufficient, or other conditions that would render values invalid).  
Missing data conventions  
Statistical handling of missing assessments, e.g. measurements not collected during sleep at 
night, will be outlined in the SAP.  
Multiplicity Considerations  
No multiplicity adjustments are planned in this Phase [ADDRESS_1082064] or confirm the outlier. 
 Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant 
Medications 
Demographic data, medical history, concomitant diseases , and concomitant medications will be 
summarized via descriptive statistics, as appropriate, (overall and by [CONTACT_156261]).  
Medical history, concomitant medications and AEs will be coded to Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA  Version 21.0 or higher ) and World Health Organization (WHO) 
Drug dictionaries, as appropriate, for the purpose of summarization.  8.[ADDRESS_1082065] listings.  
8.5.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
 Hypothesis to be Tested  
The null hypothesis is that the time to use of conventional attack  treatment following KVD900 
treatment and the time to conventional attack  treatment following placebo treatment are 
identical:  
H0: tk - tp = 0, 
where tk is the  time to use of conventional attack  treatment following KVD900 treatment 
in Part 2 and t p is the time to conventional attack  treatment following placebo treatment. 
The alternative hypothesis is that the  time to use of conventional attack  treatment following 
KVD900 treatment is different from the time to conventional attack  treatment following placebo 
treatment: 
Ha: tk - tp ≠ 0. 
 Statistical Methods  
The primary endpoint, time to use of conventional attack  treatment within 12h of study drug, will 
be analyzed using a  
to reflect the repeat measures on each subject. Subjects will be treated as censored if 
conventional attack treatment is not used within 12h of study drug.  
8.5.2 Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary efficacy endpoints, which will be analyzed for Part 2 of the study, are: 
• PGI-S (5LS ): 
o Worsening (including use of conventional attack treatment) : 
• Proportion of HAE attacks that (1) worsen by [CONTACT_786594] 
(2) use conventional attack treatment within 12h of study drug.

An oversampl ing by 20% (10 subjects ) is proposed to account for subjects that may not 
complete both treatment periods due to infrequent or inelig ible HAE attacks or for subjects who 
discontinue the trial early, for whateve r reason. Thus, study enrolment will be considered 
suffic ient to address the primary efficacy hypothes is after approx imate ly [ADDRESS_1082067] not completed both periods will be asked 
to return to the study site and complete Visit 4 (Early Discontinuat ion visit). Data from all

 Data Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor  or Sponsor’s designee will conduct a site visit to verify the qualifications of each 
Investigator, inspect the site facilities, and inform the Investigator of responsibilities and the 
procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each subject. All 
information recorded on the eCRF  system  for this study must be consistent with the subjects’ 
source documentation ( i.e., medical records).  
9.1.1 Database Management and Q uality Control  
All data generated by [CONTACT_786629] s. Data from external sources (such as laboratory data) will be imported into the 
database. Once the eCRF  clinical data have been submitted to the central server at the 
independent data centr e, corrections to the data fields will be captured in an audit trail. The 
reason for change, the name [CONTACT_27501], together with the time and date will be logged to provide an audit trail.  
If additional corrections are needed, the responsible Orion CRA  or data mana ger will raise a 
query in the electronic data collection (EDC) application. The appropriate staff at the study site 
will answer queries sent to the I nvestigator. The name [CONTACT_786640]. Once all source data 
verification is complete and all queries are closed, the eCRF  page will be frozen. 
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the EDC  system  / 
eCRF  will be provided to study sites in a training manual. In addition, site personnel will receive 
training on the EDC system  / eCRF . 
 Case Report Forms and Source Documentation 
All data obtained during this study should be entered in the eCRF . All source documents from 
which eCRF  entries are derived should be placed in the subject’s medical records. 
Measurements for which source documents are usually available include laboratory assessments, and study specific exam inations.  
Data that will be entered directly into the eCRF system (i.e., for which there is no prior written or 
electronic record of data) are considered to be source data.  
The original eCRF  entries  for each subject may be checked against source documents at the 
study site by [CONTACT_786630] . 
After review by [CONTACT_786630] , completed eCRF  entries will be uploaded and forwarded to 
Orion . Instances  of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the Investigator  for 
resolution.  
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the eCRF  will be 
provided to study sites in a training manual. In addition, site personnel will receive training on the EDC system  / eCRF . 9.1

Final , Version 5.3 67 of 72   24 November  2020  9.2.1 D ata C ollection  
The Investigators (and appropriately authorized staff) will be given access to an on-line 
web-based EDC system which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. This system is specifically 
designed for the collection of the clinical data in electronic format. Access and right to the 
EDC system will be carefully controlled and configured according to each individual’s role 
throughout the study. In general, only the Investigator and authorized staff will be able to enter 
data and make corrections in the eCRF s. 
The eCRF  should be completed for each subject included in the study and should reflect the 
latest observations on the subject s participating in the study. Therefore, the eCRF s are to be 
completed as soon as possible during or immediately after the subject ’s visit or assessment. 
The Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRF  are accurate and correct. If some 
assessments cannot be done, or if certain information is unavailable, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF .  
Computeri zed data– check programs and manual checks will identify any clinical data 
discrepancies for resolution. Corresponding queries will be loaded into the system and the site will be informed about new issues to be resolved on-line. All discrepancies will be solved on–line directly by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or by [CONTACT_786631]. Off–line edit checks will be done to 
examine relationships over time and across panels to facilitate quality data. 
After completion, the Investigator will be required to electronically sign off the clinical data. 
Data about all study product dispensed to the subject and any dosage changes will be tracked 
on the eCRF.  
 Access to Source Data 
During the study, the Orion CRA  will make site visits to review protocol compliance, compare 
eCRF  entries  and individual subject’s source medical records, assess drug accountability, and 
ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements. The 
review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is 
maintained. 
Chec king of the eCRF  entries  for completeness and clarity, and cross -checking with source 
documents, will be required to monitor the progress of the study. Moreover, Regulatory 
Authorities  of certain countries, IECs,  IRBs  and / or the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance 
Group may wish to carry out such source data checks and / or on– site audit inspections. Direct 
access to source data will be required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out 
giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. The Investigator  assures 
Orion  and the Sponsor of the necessary support at all times.  
 Data Processing 
All data will be entered by [CONTACT_786632] / eCRF  (as detailed in 
Section 9.2.1). 
The data-review and data-handling document, to be developed during the initiation phase of the study, will include specifications for consistency and plausibility checks on data and will al so 
include data -handling rules for obvious data errors. Query  / correction sheets for unresolved 
queries will be sent to the study CRA s for resolution with the Investigator . The database will be 
updated on the basis of signed corrections.  9.[ADDRESS_1082068] (DRL), which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC) classification system. 
Medical history  / current medical conditions and AEs will be coded using  the 
MedDRA  terminology. 
Previous and concomitant diseases as well as AEs will be coded with MedDRA . 
The versions of the coding dictionaries will be provided in the Clinical Study Report. 
 Archiving Study Records 
According to International Council  on Harmonization ( ICH) guidelines, essential documents 
should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1082069] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of the IMP. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_200518].

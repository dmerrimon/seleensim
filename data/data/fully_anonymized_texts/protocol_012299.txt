SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX0 23-CL20 5 Amendment 2  
12 June  2017  
Protocol UX023-CL205 Amendment 1 (dated 2 8 March  2016) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 2 to modify the study duration, allow for parent/caregiver administration of 
study drug, and formally incorporate information communicated to investigators via 
memoranda (dated [ADDRESS_1218904] 2016, and 13 Dec 2016). The major 
protocol changes that  impact study design and conduct are summarized below:  
1. Study Objectives:   The following additional study objective (along with 
corresponding Section 7.5.4 Pharmacokinetic Assessment) has been modified:  
• Pre-dose KRN23 drug concentration levels (PK)  
Rationale:  Clarification of language since KRN23 drug concentration levels are being 
assessed at time points corresponding to [ADDRESS_1218905] dose or at trough.  
2. Overall Study Design and Plan:  The provision to maintain gender balance has been modified: 
To maintain a level of gender balance, no more than 7 70% of  subjects of either 
gender will be enrolled. 
Rationale:  The original protocol planned sample size was 10 subjects, therefore 7 subjects  (ie, 70% of the study population) w ere selected. The change more 
accurately reflects the total enrollment of 13 subjects (9 male; 69%).    
3. Study Duration:  An Extension Period of 96 weeks has been added . 
Rationale :  The Extension Period has been added to the study for continued 
assessment of long -term safety and efficacy  of KRN23 in younger children. 
4. Removal of Subjects:  In Section 7.3.3, language has been added to allow orthopedic 
surgery during the Extension Period if recommended by [CONTACT_872526] . In addition, subjects who develop hyperparathyroidism may remain on 
study, but use of medication to suppress PTH ( eg, Sensipar
®, cinacalcet, 
calcimimetics) is not permitted at any time. Subjects should be removed from study if treatment for hyperparathyroidism becomes medically necessary.  
Rationale:  Give n that the study duration was increased, certain conditions or the need 
for medical procedures may develop during the study. The additional provisions 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment 2 
12 June 2017   
 
Confidential  Page 3 
allow subjects to remain on study should orthopedic surgery be recommended or mild 
hyperparathyroidism de velop . 
5. Treatmen t:  Section 7.4.[ADDRESS_1218906] and physical 
inventory of empty vials at site visits  for study drug accountability.  
Rationale: Allowing subjects’ parents or caregiver s to administer KRN23 in the home 
setting will reduc e burden on the subjects. Instructions for Use (IFU)  have been 
thoughtfully developed with input from XLH patients and  will be used to guide 
parents and caregivers  through the injection process. The IFU will be provided to 
sites and IRBs for approval prior to the initiation of parent/caregiver  administration . 
To avoid potential errors with any dose ad justments , dose changes during the 
Extension Period will be initially implemented at the clinic visits . Site personnel will 
collect information on treatment compliance in the home setting and monitor the home administration via telephone contact. 
6. Study Procedures and Assessments:  Several changes  have been made in 
Section  7.5; a new Schedule of Events table ( Table 2.3) was included to describe 
visits and assessments during the Extension Period. 
a) During the Extension Period, clinic visits will occur at approximately 12 -week 
intervals (±5 days). Home health or telephone visits will occur every 2 weeks. 
For telephone visits, s tudy sites will schedule biweekly telephone calls with the 
subjects’ parent/caregiver  to confirm administration of study drug, and for 
collection of adverse events and concomitant medication information. S ite 
personnel will initiate a safety follow -up telephone call 5 weeks  (+5 days) after 
the Week [ADDRESS_1218907] information on any ongoing or new AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medications for subjects not receiving KRN23. The additional safety visit ( 10 weeks ± 5 d ays 
after Week 160 ) will apply to subjects who discontinue treatment early or choose 
not to continue KRN23 therapy as commercial product or through another mechanism once the study ends. 
Rationale:  Additional clinic visits and telephone calls have been included in the 
Extension Period to monitor long- term safety, compliance, and efficacy at an interval 
deemed appropriate for the age of the population and duration of treatment. 
b) As previously communicated by [CONTACT_872527] ([ADDRESS_1218908] 2016), Section 7.5.2 has 
been updated to remove TmP/GFR and TRP as estimates of renal phosphate 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment 2 
12 June 2017   
 
Confidential  Page 4 
reabsorption due to the breadth of available data and burden of obtaining urine 
samples in this study population (under 5 years of age). 
c) As previously communicated by [CONTACT_872527] ([ADDRESS_1218909] 2016), the Week 22 serum calcium assessment has been removed from the Schedule of Events Table 2.1. 
d) As previously communicated by [CONTACT_872527] (05 Apr 2016), Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated such that blood pressure will be obtained for subjects aged 3 years 
or above (at study entry or beginning when the subject turns 3 years of age). The 
provision for training on blood pressure measurements at the site initiation visit was removed.   
e) As previously communicated by [CONTACT_872527] (13 Dec 2016), Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to indicate that the scope of the genitourinary exam should be non-invasive and as per age -appropriate standard of care, at the investigator’s 
discretion based on clinical judgement.  
Rationale:  The changes to pharmacodynamic assessments, blood pressure and 
genitourinary examinations provide clarification of study procedures for the investigator.  
f) In Section 7.5.5, Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been changed from an ectopic 
mineralization assessment to a general safety assessment.  
Rationale:  ECG is performed t o evaluate for changes associated with left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Ectopic mineralization is not expected to affect ECG parameters and ECG was inadvertently listed in that section in the original protocol.   
g) As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_872521] [ADDRESS_1218910]’s CRF.  
Rationale:  Inclusion of telephone calls provides a mechanism to track use of 
concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_193238] a consistent frequency during the Extension Period. 
7. Statistical Analysis  and Data Monitoring Committee:   The statistical models for 
efficacy analysis have been updated in Section 7.6.3. A new Section 7.6.4 has been inserted to describe the timing of planned analysis for the study. During the Extension Period, safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_492366] (SSRT) on an ongoing basis (Section s 7.6.5 and  8.5.6 ).  
Rationale:   The analysis is updated to incorporate baseline adjustment and repeated 
measures at multiple time points. Section 7.6.4 clarifies the times during the study when safety and efficacy data may be analyzed and more precisely defin es the end of 
the study. Section s 7.6.5 and 8.5.6 stipulate  the Data Mo nitoring Committee will 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment 2 
12 June 2017   
 
Confidential  Page 5 
review safety data through the Treatment Period (Week 64); long- term safety during 
the Extension Period will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034]. 
8. Investigators and Study Administrative Structure:   As previously communicated 
by [CONTACT_872527] (30 Sept 2016), Section 8.2 has been updated to include language 
describing the Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25810]. The Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_872522], MD (Indiana University School of Medicine). 
Rationale:   Regulatory guidance requires selection of a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 
a multicenter  clinical trial.  
9. Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Events :  Section 8.5 has been updated to 
define the reporting periods for adverse events as: 
….the time  that the subject signs informed consent through the final protocol- defined 
safety follow- up telephone call or safety visit  12 weeks (approximately 5 times the 
elimination half -life) following the last dose of study drug. 
Rationale:  The revised language reflects the revised study design  and safety 
follow-up procedures. 
10. In Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 and the Schedules of Events, the parenthetical explanation of 
anti-KRN23 antibodies has been changed from human anti-human antibodies 
(HAHA) to anti -drug antibodies (ADA). 
Rationale : The change is a clarification. The immunogenicity of KRN23 is evaluated 
by [CONTACT_460020]-drug antibodies (ADA), independent of isotype, in human serum. While the study protocol previously used the term “HAHA” for this assessment, it has been replaced with  the more correct and specific term, ADA .

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
An Open -Label, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of KRN23 in 
Children from 1 to  4 Years Old with X -linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) 
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 
UX023- CL205 
STUDY SITES:  
Approximately 3 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2 
RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY:  
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate wasting , 
defective bone mineralization , and impaired growth plate or endochondral ossification caused by 
[CONTACT_492356] (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to 
endopeptidases on the X chromosome) , and is the most common form of heritable rickets. In the 
absence of functional PHEX , FGF23 production by [CONTACT_492357] , leading to 
impaired conservation of phosphate by [CONTACT_673722]. FGF23 also 
suppresses 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D) production resulting in decreased inte stinal 
absorption of calcium and phosphate. The chronic presence of low serum phosphorus levels leads to 
defective bone mineralization and the two major pathologic consequences of the hypophosphatemia, rickets and osteomalacia. Rickets and osteomalacia are  both disorders of bone mineralization; 
however, rickets is a disease of the growth plates specifically, characterized by [CONTACT_673723], leading to reduced growth and skeletal deformities. The goal  of therapy in children with XLH is to correct  or minimize  rickets, 
radiographic abnormalities, and skeletal  deformities, and to promote maximal growth potential while 
preventing the lifelong bone - and joint-related complications of rickets . Published retr ospective data 
suggest that earlier treatment leads to better outcomes for children with XLH  (Makitie et al. 2003 ), 
(Quinlan et al. 2012). 
There is no available medicine that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated 
FGF23 -induced hypophosphatemia.  The current therapy for pediatric XLH patients consists of 
multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined with doses of active vitamin  D analogs. 
Dosing is individualized and depends on tolerability of the phosphate dose and the age, size, and 
growth of the child. The goal of therapy with phosphate and vitamin D is to sufficiently supplement 
the body’s pool of phosphate to allow mineralization of bone and improve skeletal outcomes; 
however, because supplementation therapy does not address the mechanism of urinary phosphate wasting, increasing phosphate through supplementation also increases renal phosphate throughput 
and urinary phosphate concentrations, thus raising  the risk of nephrocalcinosis.  
KRN23 is a recombinant human IgG 1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and i nhibits the activity of 
FGF23 . Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in adults and children (aged 5-12 years) with XLH have shown 
that KRN23 treatment increases serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D levels and the ratio of renal 
tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR). Initial 
Phase [ADDRESS_1218911] KRN23 treatment also improves  rickets  severity with a

Confidential  Page 7 
favorable safety profile.  
Early t reatment of children with XLH is associated with better growth and skeletal outcomes. 
In retrospective studies, children beginning treatment before age 1 had consistently higher z scores 
and lower alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  levels than children starting treatment later  (Makitie et al. 
2003), ( Quinlan et al. 2012 ), suggesting that growth deficits accumulated before treatment may lead 
to permanent height loss. The current study will provide information about the  safety profile , dosing, 
and effect of KRN23 on phosphate metabolism in children with XLH ( 1 to 4 years of age, inclusive ) 
and confirmed evidence of rickets. In addition, this study will evaluat e whether biweekly dosing of 
KRN23 improves rickets, growth,  and lower extremity deformity  in young children with XLH. 
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objectives of the study are to:  
• Establish the safety profile of KRN23 for the treatment of XLH in children between 1 and 4 years 
old  
• Determine the pharmacodynamic (PD ) effects of KRN23 treatment on serum phosphorus and 
other PD  markers that reflect the status of phosphate homeostasis in children between 1 and 4 
years old  with XLH  
Additional study objectives ar e to assess the following in children between 1 and 4 years old with 
XLH  
• Effects of KRN23 on rickets  
• Effects of KRN23 on growth and lower extremity deformity  
• KRN23 drug concentration levels (PK) 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY :  
UX023-CL205 is a multicenter , open- label , Phase [ADDRESS_1218912] therapy with oral phosphate and active 
vitamin D  to assess the safety, PD , and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) 
injections every 2  weeks (Q2W) for a 64-week  Treatment Period . Subjects may continue to receive 
KRN23 for up to an additional 96 weeks during the Extension Period. 
The study will enroll approximatel y 10 pediatric subjects  between 1 and 4 years old, inclusive, with 
clinical findings consistent with   XLH including hypophosphatemia and radiographic evidence of 
rickets (a t least [ADDRESS_1218913] a rickets severity score (RSS) at the knee of ≥1.5 point s at 
Screening), and a confirmed PHEX mutation or variant of uncertain significance. To maintain a level 
of gender balance, no more than 70%  of subjects of either gender will be enrolled. Subjects will 
discontinue oral phosphate and active vit amin  D therapy during Screening and for the duration of the 
study.   
All subjects will receive KRN23 at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W . The dose may be increased to 
1.2 mg/kg at any time during the study if a subject meets the following dose- adjustment criteria: 
1) two consecutive serum phosphorus measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum 
phosphorus has increased by < 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and  3) the subject has not missed a dose of 
study drug that would account for the decrease in serum phosphorus.

At any time during the study, if serum phosphorus increases above the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
for age, the subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_941] m edical m onitor before 
dosing resumes. Once other causes of  increased serum phosphorus are excluded, KRN23 treatment 
will resume at half the total dose of the last dose received. Serum phosphorus will be followed through unscheduled serum phosphorus assessments. A subject will resume dosing at the previous 
full to tal dose level if they meet the same dose- adjustment criteria listed above.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT(S), DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
KRN23 is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative-free solution in single -use 5 -mL vials 
containing 1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL. Subjects will receive 
KRN23 at a starting total dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time if a 
subject meets the following dose adjustment criteria: 1) two consecutive serum phosphorus measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum p hosphorus has increased by < 0.5 mg/dL from 
baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of study drug that would account for the decrease in serum phosphorus. At any time during the study, if serum phosphorus increases above the ULN for 
age, the subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_941] m edical monitor before 
dosing resumes. Once other causes of increased serum phosphorus are excluded, KRN23 treatment 
will resume at half the total dose of the last dose received. Serum phosphor us will be followed 
through unscheduled serum phosphorus assessments. A subject will resume dosing at the previous full total dose level if they meet the same dose- adjustment criteria listed above.  
KRN23 will be administered via SC injection to the abdomen, upper arms or thighs; the injection site will be rotated with each injection. After proper training, a parent or caregiver may administer 
KRN23 to the subject.  
REFERENCE THERAPY(IES), DOSEAND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
This is single -arm, open- label study. All subjects will receive KRN23 . No placebo or reference 
therapy will be administered. 
DURATION OF TREATMENT :  
The Treatment Period  in this study is 64 weeks.  Subjects  who complete the Treatment Period  may 
continue to receive KRN23 for an additional 96  weeks during the Extension Period .

5 INTRODUCTION 
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate 
wasting, defective bone mineralization , and impaired growth plate or endochondral 
ossification  caused by [CONTACT_492356] (phosphate- regulating gene 
with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome), and is the most common form of heritable rickets . In the absence of functional PHEX, release of fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23) by [CONTACT_492357] , leading to impaired conservation of phosphate by 
[CONTACT_673722]. FGF23 also suppresses 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D (1,25(OH)
2D) production resulting in decreased intestinal absorption of 
calcium and phosphate.  
Chronic hypophosphatemia leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, the 
two major pathologic features of XLH. Rickets and osteomalacia are both  disorders of bone 
mineralization; however, rickets is a disease of the growth plates specifically, characterized by [CONTACT_673723], leading to reduced growth and skeletal deformities ( Shore et al. 2013) . Osteomalacia occurs in both 
children and adults wherein low levels of phosphorus prevent normal mineralization of osteoid, resulting in low bone turnover and poor quality bone ( Shore et al. 2013). The goal of 
therapy in children with XLH is to correct or minimize rickets, radiographic abnormalities, and skeletal deformities, and to promote maximal growth potential while preventing the 
lifelong bone- and joint- related complications of rickets. Published data suggest that earl ier 
treatment may lead to better long -term outcomes. In retrospective studies, children beginning 
treatment before age 1 had consistently higher z scores and lower alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels than children starting treatment later (Makitie et al. 2003), ( Quinlan et al. 2012).  
There is no available medicine that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated FGF23 -induced hypophosphatemia  in XLH .
 The current therapy for pediatric XLH 
patients consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined with doses of active vitamin D analogs. Dosing is individualized and depends on tolerability of the phosphate dose and the age, size, and growth of the child. Doses may be further adjusted based on the efficacy response to treatment or evidence of second ary complications 
(Carpent er et al. 2011).  The goal of therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D  is to 
sufficiently supplement the body’s pool of phosphate to allow mineralization of bone and improve skeletal outcomes; however, because supplementation therapy does not address the mechanism of urinary phosphate wasting, increasing phosphate through supplementation also increases renal phosphate throughput and urinary phosphate concentrations, thus raising the risk of nephrocalcinosis. Therefore, an opportunity exists for more targeted treatment of XLH by [CONTACT_872531]23 to normalize serum phosphorus and prevent long-term consequences of chronic hypophosphatemia. 
Proof-of-concept studies in a relevant murine model support the use of an anti- FGF23 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a treatment for XLH. Experiments in both juvenile and adult 
hypophosphatemic mice provided evidence that treatment with an anti-FGF23 mAb normalized or ameliorated many of the characteristic abnormalities associated with XLH

(Aono et al. 2009) , (Aono et al. 2011). KRN23 is a fully human IgG 1 mAb that binds to and 
inhibits FGF23. The Sponsor and development partner, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (KHK) 
are investigating KRN23 as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of XLH, a disease distinguished by [CONTACT_492371]23. 
KHK has  conducted a series of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and 
toxicology studies supporting the investigation of KRN23 in adults and children. 
Three clinical studies have been completed in adult patients with XLH: a single dose Phase 1 safety and tolerability study of KRN23, a repeat dose Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, and an associated treatment extension study. An additional open- label , long-term extension study in 
adults is ongoing. A Phase 2 study (UX023 -CL201) in pediatric XLH patients  aged 5 to 
12 years receiving KRN23 at multiple doses up to 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) is ongoing and no new safety concerns have been identified.  
This Phase [ADDRESS_1218930] of KRN23 on phosphate 
metabolism in children under 5 years old. In addition, this study will evaluate whether Q2W  
dosing of KRN23 improves rickets, growth, and lower extremity d eformity  in young children 
with XLH.  
5.1 Overview of XLH  
XLH is a rare, genetic disorder that is serious, chronically debilitating , and represents an 
unmet medical need. This genetic deficiency is estimated to occur in about 1:20,000 live births ( Burnett et al. 1964), ( Imel et al. 2005 ), (Beck -Nielsen et al. 2009) . XLH is the most 
common inherited form of rickets and the most common inherited defect in renal tubular phosphate transport. XLH is transmitted as an X-linked dominant disorder ( Dixon et al. 
1998). Mutations resulting in the loss of function of PHEX form the genetic basis for XLH (Carpenter et al. 2011). More than [ADDRESS_1218931] been identified 
in patients with XLH ( PHEXdb ); however, few definitive correlations have been observed 
between specific mutations and phenotypic severity. 
Patients with XLH have hypophosphatemia due to excessive FGF23 levels ( Jonsson et al. 
2003), ( Yamazaki et al. 2002 ); however, the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_872532] X disruption 
results in elevated FGF23 is complex and not fully understood ( Carpenter et al. 2011 ), (Rowe 
2012). FGF23 plays an important role as a specific regulator of serum phosphorus; its major 
function is to reduce serum phosphorus levels by [CONTACT_492373] ( Fukumoto 2008), ( Razzaque et al. 2007 ). FGF23 also decreases serum 
1,25(OH)
2D levels by [CONTACT_61670] 1 -alpha- hydroxylase activity in the kidney, thereby 
[CONTACT_492374]. Both actions by [CONTACT_9266]23 on the tubular reabsorption and intestinal absorption via vitamin D metabolism lead to a decrease in serum phosphorus levels. 
Patients with XLH often present during childhood with rickets due to hypophosphatemia and 
frequently develop skeletal abnormalities (e.g. , bowed legs), impaired growth, and short adult 
stature ( Tenenhouse et al. 2001). As young patients age and progress into adulthood, the

symptom pattern evolves due to decreased phosphate requirements for bone growth. 
Adult XLH patients suffer from bone pain and osteomalacia, increased risk of bone fractures, joint abnormalities and joint pain, enthesopathy, and osteoarthritis ( Carpenter et al. 2011) .
 
There is a great deal of variability in the manifestations of  XLH. In more severe disease, 
hypophosphatemia leads to decreased mineralization of newly formed bone and rickets. Surgical correction of limb deformities is often required  (Santos et al. 2013), ( Zivicnjak et al. 
2011). 
The current therapy for pediatric XLH patients consists o f multiple daily doses of oral 
phosphate often combined with doses of active vitamin D metabolites (e.g. , calcitriol and 
alfacalcidol ). No consensus exists regarding treatment of adult patients with XLH ( Linglart et 
al. 2014). The use of oral phosphate and vitamin D may be initiat ed for the treatment of 
osteomalacia, bone/joint pain, and pseudofractures in symptomatic patients, although 
evidence of efficacy in adults is limited ( Sullivan et al. 1992). Treatment with oral phosphate 
and active vitamin D  requires frequent and continued monitoring of patients. Serum and 
urine mi neral metabolite levels and imaging studies are required to assess toxicity and 
secondary complications, including nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism ( Carpenter et al. 2011). 
5.2 Brief Overview of KRN23  Development  
A brief overview of existing information on KRN23 is provided below; a comprehensive review of the data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provided by [CONTACT_467858]. (Ultragenyx), which should be reviewed prior to initiating the study. 
5.2.1 Brief Description o f KRN23  
KRN23 is a recom binant human IgG
1 mAb that binds to an0064 inhibits the activity of 
FGF23. KRN23 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary dihydrofolate reductase- deficient 
cells. The secreted KRN23 antibody is recovered from the culture medium and purified using 
a series of chromatographic and filtration steps. Based on the amino acid sequence, the 
predicted molecular mass of KRN23 is approximately 140 kilodaltons (kDa). Nonclinical studies demonstrated KRN23 possesses high binding affinity to the N-terminal domain of FGF23. KRN23 binds to FGF23 from humans, cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits, but not to other species tested.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action in XLH  
Patients with XLH have hypophosphatemia due to excessive serum FGF23 levels. FGF23 reduces serum phosphorus levels by [CONTACT_492376] ( Fukumoto 2008), 
(Razzaque et al. 2007), ( Yamazaki et al. 2008 ). The primar y mechanism is to inhibit 
phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. The secondary mechanism is to decrease phosphate absorption by [CONTACT_35687] 1,25(OH)
2D 
production in the kidney. 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205

KRN23 has the potential to block or reduce FGF23 action and improve phosphate 
homeostasis in XLH patients. KRN23 binds the amino- terminal domain of FGF23 that 
interacts with the FGF -binding portion of the combination FGFR1/Klotho receptor, 
preventing FGF23 from binding to and si gnaling from its receptor. Both intact and 
fragmented FGF23 polypeptides are immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_460001]23 ( Yamazaki et al. 
2008). By [CONTACT_35688]23, KRN23 restores tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP/GFR) from the kidney and increases the production of 1,25(OH)
2D that also enhances intestinal 
absorption of phosphate. It is expected  that by [CONTACT_872533]23 , the 
underlying cause of XLH , and thereby [CONTACT_872534] , 
KRN23  has the potential to significantly alter the natural history of the disease.   
5.2.2 Nonclinical Studies  
The hypophosphatemic (Hyp) mouse is a murine homologue of XLH with a deletion in the 3ꞌ region of the PHEX gene ( Liu et al. 2007), ( Perwad et al. 2005). In addition to 
hypophosphatemia, rickets, and associated developmental abnormalities, these animals display elevated serum FGF23 levels and increased expression of FGF23 in the bone. Since KRN23 does not bind murine FG F23, the pharmacological effects of murine 
anti-FGF23 mAbs were examined in juvenile and adult Hyp mice ( Aono et al. 2009), ( Aono 
et al. 2011) . In juvenile Hyp mice, anti-FGF23 treatment corrected hypophosphatemia and 
ameliorated the rachitic bone ph enotypes ( Aono et al. 2009). In adult Hyp mice, anti- FGF23 
treatment increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)
2D levels, and increased grip strength and 
spontaneous movement ( Aono et al. 2011). These studies provide proof- of-concept that 
treatment with antibodies targeting FGF23  may reverse or amelio rate characteristic 
abnormalities associated with XLH.  
KRN23 binds to human, rabbit, and monkey FGF23 with comparable affinities. In a study conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions, KRN23 cross- reactivity was 
evaluated against a full panel of human, rabbit (32 tissues), and cynomolgus monkey (33 tissues) tissues by [CONTACT_9064]. No specific KRN23 staining was observed 
suggesting untoward direct- effects of KRN23 are not expected in any tissues of normal 
humans, rabbits, or cynomolgus monkeys.  
A series of nonclinical pharmacology, PK, and toxicity studies have been conducted in 
rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys to support the use of KRN23 in adults and children. Findings of potential clinical significance and relevance to this protocol are summarized below; additional information is provided in the IB. 
• The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) in a 40 -week toxicity study in adult cynomolgus 
monkeys was 0.03 mg/kg KRN23 for males and 0.3 mg/kg KRN23 for females. 
The NOAEL in a 40 -week toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys and a 
single -dose study in rabbits was 0.3 mg/kg KRN23. 
• Soft tissue and organ mineralization was a consistent finding associated with prolonged 
and excessive serum phosphate levels including the kidney where nephrocalcinosis was 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218932] dose tested and reversibility of mineralization could not be 
established.  
• The most prominent pharmacologic actions of KRN23 were dose- dependent changes in 
serum inorganic phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D in rabbits and juvenile, adult and pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
• No gross or histopathological abnormalities were observed at the intravenous (IV) infusion sites or subcutaneous (SC) injection sites in the 40- week repeat dose toxicity 
studies in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys.  
• KRN23 demonstrated consistent and predictable PK behavior in both rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys based on the results of single and repeat dose studies where 
exposure was by [CONTACT_492377].  
The NOAEL was the same in juvenile and adult monkeys suggesting no difference in sensitivity to the adverse effects of KRN23. The results from s ingle - and repeat -dose 
toxicology studies in rabbits and juvenile, adult and pregnant cynomolgus monkeys suggest the primary toxicological effects of KRN23 are associated with prolonged and excessive antagonism of the normal regulatory actions of FGF23 on renal tubular phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D metabolism.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1218933] been conducted in adult patients with XLH: a single dose Phase 1 safety and tolerability study of KRN23 (KRN23- US-02), a single dose Phase 1 safety and 
tolerability study in Japan and Korea (KRN23-001), a repeat dose Phase 1/2 dose escalation study (KRN23 -INT-001), and an associated treatment extension study (KR N23 INT-002). 
An additional open- label long -term extension study (UX023-CL203) in adults , a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study (UX023-CL303), and an open- label, paired 
bone biopsy Phase 3 study to evaluate changes in osteomalacia at the tissue  level with 
KRN23 treatment are ongoing. Details of study parameters and PK, PD, clinical efficacy , and 
safety results are provided in the IB. A Phase 2 study evaluating dose, PD, efficacy,  and 
safety is also  ongoing in pediatric XLH patients (UX023 -CL201) aged 5 to 12 years . 
Data from clinical studies to date are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action: that KRN23 blocks FGF23 action, leading to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due to increased TmP/GFR and increased intestinal absor ption caused by [CONTACT_67191] 1,25(OH)
2D. 
Single and repeat -dose clinical studies indicate SC administration of KRN23 consistently 
increased and sustained serum phosphorus levels and TmP/GFR, without a major impact on urine calcium levels or vitamin D metabolism  (Carpenter et al. 2014 ), (Imel et al. 2015). 
Data from the extension study in adults suggest KRN23 could provide sustained increases in 
serum phosphorus levels sufficiently such that improvements in bone physiology, structure, and function would be expected ( Imel et al. 2015) .  
Repeated doses of KRN23 up to 1.0 mg/kg were well tolerated by [CONTACT_872535] 1/2 dose escalation study a nd associated treatment extension study

(Imel et al. 2015) . No deaths  or life threatening treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) 
have been reported. In the extension study, serious adverse events (SAEs) reported for 
3 subjects were unlikely to be or were not study drug related: breast cancer, hypertensive crisis, and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]. Throughout the long- term extension study, 
treatment -related AEs were reported for 14  subjects (63.6%) treated with KRN23 and 
included injection site reaction (5 subjects, 22.7%), arthralgia (3 subjects, 13.6%), restless 
legs syndrome (2 subjects, 9.1%), and injection site pain (2 subjects, 9.1%). No discernible clinically significant trends of lab abnormalities suggestive of a treatment- related adverse 
effect were noted. Overall, no immunogenicity or patterns of dose- limiting toxicity have been 
associated with KRN23 treatment.  
Similar to the adult studies, interim analyses from the Phase 2 pediatric study (UX023 -CL201) showed KRN23 treatment up to 2 mg/kg Q2W  or Q4W  increased serum 
phosphorus levels, TmP/GFR, and 1,25(OH)
2D levels . Interim results also show KRN23 
improved rickets, with a mean reduction in rickets severity score (RSS) from Baseline to Week 40 . Consistency in the rickets results was observed using the Radiographic Global 
Impressi on of Change (RGI -C) scoring method. Overall, the dose-response and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) results observed in the pediatric study were consistent with the adult XLH data generated to date. None of the subject s had serum phosphorus levels above the 
normal ra nge in either dosing group. Most treatment- related AE s were mild, most commonly 
a transient injection site reaction (39%). One child experienced a serious AE and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_673690]/muscle pain that improved and continues in the trial. No clinically meaningful changes occurred in serum or urine calcium, serum iPTH, or renal ultrasound.

radiographic abnormalities, and skeletal deformities, and by  [CONTACT_673733] - and joint- related complications of rickets.  
This therapeutic approach directly targets the inherent dysregulation in XLH (i.e., excess 
FGF23). In contrast, supplementation therapy with phosphate and/or 1,25(OH)
2D, is only 
partially effective and carries a significant burden and risk of ectopic mineralization, particularly nephrocalcinosis.  
Clinical studies to date have d emonstrated that KRN23 treatment blocks FGF23 action and 
leads to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels due to increased TmP/GFR. Increased 1,25(OH)
2D was also observed, as expected, based on the inhibition of the excess 
of FGF23. Bone formation and resorption markers also increased. Preliminary data in children with XLH suggest that KRN23 treatment may also improve rickets. No major safety concerns were observed  with KRN23 in the population studied; there was no evidence of 
immunogenicity, and no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) based on

electrocardiogram (ECG) even though FGF23 levels were increased following KRN23 
treatment. Although ectopic mineralization is a known risk related to XLH disease and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_492378]/or active vitamin D  supplementation, KRN23 does not 
appear to be associated with progression of cardiac or renal ectopic mineralization beyond the natural course of pre- existing disease.  
KRN23 administered SC  Q2W  or Q4W  at doses up to 2 mg/kg achieved the desired PD 
effect in children and evidence of a clinical effect in healing rickets , positioning KRN23 as a 
drug that could be administered twice per month  by [CONTACT_10530], which is a convenient and 
acceptable therapeutic regimen for a chronic condition.   
In conclusion, KRN23 inhibits the effects of FGF23, restoring phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism homeostasis. In children with XLH, preliminary data  suggest that KRN23 
treatment may improve rickets. By [CONTACT_872536]23 and increasing  serum phosphorus 
levels , it is expected that rickets  severity  in children with XLH will be healed or reduced , 
leading to improved clinical outcomes and  quality of l ife of children with XLH. To date, 
KRN23 has a favorable safety profile without evidence of increased ectopic mineralization or other concerns associated with the excess of FGF23. KRN23 has the potential to be an effective and safe treatment option for pat ients with XLH.  
5.4 Study Rationale 
XLH is a disorder of hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate wasting, defective bone mineralization , and impaired growth plate or endochondral ossification caused by 
[CONTACT_492356] (phosphate -regulating ge ne with homologies to 
endopeptidases on the X chromosome), and is the most common form of heritable rickets. In the absence of functional PHEX, release of FGF23 by [CONTACT_492357]. 
Excess circulating FGF23 impairs conservation of phosphate by [CONTACT_100276]- regulating NaPi- IIa 
and NaPi -IIc in the tubular cells and suppress es 1,25(OH)
2D production, resulting in 
decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Chronic low serum phosphorus levels lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia in a dults, the two major pathologic 
outcomes of the hypophosphatemia. Rickets is a disorder of open growth plates characterized by [CONTACT_872537], leading to reduced growth and skeletal deformities. O steomalacia is characterized by a lack of proper 
mineralization, a prolonged mineralization process, and an accumulation of osteoid tissue with a  consequent deterioration of bone remodeling ( Shore et al. 2013) . 
There is no available medicine that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated FGF23 -induced hypophosphatemia  in XLH .
 The current  therapy for pediatric XLH 
patients  consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate often combined with doses of 
active vitamin  D analogs. Dosing is individualized and depends on tolerability of the 
phosphate dose and the age, size, and growth of the child. The goal of therapy with phosphate and vitamin D is to sufficiently supplement the body’s pool of phosphate to allow mineralization of bone and improve skeletal outcomes; however, because supplementation therapy does not address the mechanism of urinary phosphate wasting, increasing phosphate through supplementation also increases renal phosphate throughput and urinary phosphate

concentrations, thus raising the risk of nephrocalcinosis. More therapeutic options that are 
efficacious, safe, and convenient, and that target the underlying pathophysiology of XLH (i.e., renal phosphate wasting induced by [CONTACT_673713]23 levels), are needed.  
KRN23 is a recombinant human IgG
1 mAb  that binds to and inhibits the activity of FGF23. 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in adults and children (aged 5- 12 years) wi th XLH have shown 
that KRN23 treatment increases serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D levels and TmP/GFR. 
Interim Phase [ADDRESS_1218935] KRN23 treatment also improves rickets 
severity with a favorable safety profile.  
Early treatment of children with XLH is associated with better growth and skeletal and 
outcomes. In retrospective studies, children beginning treatment before age 1 had consistently higher z scores and lower ALP  levels than children starting treatment later  
(Makitie et al. 2003) , (Quinlan et al. 2012) suggesting that growth deficits accumulated 
before treatment may lead to permanent heig ht loss. The current study will provide 
information about the safety profile, dosing, and effect of KRN23 on phosphate metabolism in children 1 to 4 years of age, inclusive. In addition, this study will evaluate whether biweekly dosing of KRN23 improves ri ckets, growth, and lower extremity deformity  in 
young children with XLH.

6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objectives of the study are to : 
• Establish the safety profile of KRN23 for the treatment of XLH in children between 
1 and 4 years old  
• Determine the PD eff ects of KRN23 treatment on serum phosphorus and other PD  
markers that reflect the status of phosphate homeostasis in children between 1 and 4 years 
old with XLH  
Additional study objectives are to  assess the following in children between 1 and 4 years old 
with XLH : 
• Effects of KRN23 on rickets  
• Effects of KRN23 on growth and lower extremity deformity   
• KRN23 drug concentration levels (PK)

phosphate and active vitamin D  to assess the safety, PD , and efficacy of KRN23 
administe red via SC injections Q2W  for a 64- week  Treatment Period . Subjects may continue 
to receive KRN23 for an additional 96 weeks during the Extension Period. 
The study will enroll approximately 10  pediatric subjects  between 1 and 4 years old, 
inclusive, with clinical findings consistent with  XLH including hypophosphatemia and 
radiographic evidence of rickets (a t least [ADDRESS_1218937] a rickets severity score (RSS) at 
the knee of ≥1.5 points at Screening ), and a confirmed PHEX mutation or variant of  
uncertain significance.  To maintain a level of gender balance, no more than 70%  of subjects 
of either gender will be enrolled. Those s ubjects who are receiving oral phosphate and active 
vitamin D therapy will discontinue treatment  during Screening  (after confirmation of PHEX 
mutation  and rickets eligibility criteria ) and for the duration of the study. Safety, PD, PK , and 
efficacy measures (rickets, growth, lower extremity deformity ) will be evaluated throughout 
the study.  
All subjects will receive KRN23 at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time during the study if a subject meets the following dose-adjustment criteria : 1) two consecutive serum phosphorus measurements are below the 
normal range; 2) serum phosphor us has increased by < 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and 3) the 
subject has not missed a dose of study drug that would account for the decrease in serum 
phosphorus.  
At any time during the study, if serum phosphorus increases above the ULN  for age, the 
subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_872538]. Once other causes of increased serum phosphorus are excluded, KRN23 treatment will resume at half the total dose of the last dose receive d. Serum phosphorus will 
be followed through unscheduled serum phosphorus assessments. A subject will resume dosing at the previous full total dose level if they meet the same dose -adjustment criteria 
listed above.  
The study will be conducted in a pediatr ic population; as such, additional measures including 
a DMC have been incorporated into the study design. Where possible, mea sures to minimize 
pain and distress to the subject have been considered for this study protocol including the use 
of home health vi sits. Where possible, timing of blood draws for efficacy assessments has 
been coordinated with standard safety laboratory tests to minimize risk and discomfort and avoid unnecessary duplication of testing. The primary analysis is planned at Week 40. Additi onal efficacy and safety analyses will be conducted at Week 64. A final analysis will 
be conducted at the end of the study (“study completion”), which is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact) for the last subject in 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218938] of KRN23 on phosphate metabolism in 
children 1 to 4 years of age, inclusive, with XLH. In addition, this study will evaluate 
whether Q2W  dosing of KRN23 improves rickets, growth, an d lower extremity deformity  in 
young children with XLH. No control group will be included. To demonstrate safety and efficacy in a controlled study, a larger randomized, Phase 3 study in children with a broader age range is being planned that will include two treatment arms: one group will receive KRN23 and one group will receive oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy.  
7.[ADDRESS_1218939] therapy with oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D. To maintain a level of  gender balance, no more than 70% 
of subjects of either gender will be enrolled.  
To ensure that appropriate subjects  are selected, elig ibility requirements include 
demonstrated hypophosphatemia, radiographic evidence of rickets ( at least [ADDRESS_1218940] a minimum RSS score of 1.5 points at the knee), and genetic evidence consistent with a 
diagnosis of XLH. PHEX sequence variants will  be classified according to the joint 
consensus recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology ( Richards et al. 2015) . Patients with PHEX 
mutations classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and possibly pathogenic will be included. Patients with PHEX variants of uncertain significance will also be included, as was recommended by [CONTACT_673742]. There are hundreds of variants of the PHEX gene 
and many of these have not yet been fully characterized.  
Children with XLH undergo a normal pubertal growth spurt. Post-pubertal height is predicted 
by [CONTACT_094] -pubertal height, indicating that loss of height potential generally occurs prior to 
puberty. Several studies suggest that early height loss cannot be recover ed and that earlier 
treatment leads to better growth outcomes  (Makitie et al. 2003), ( Quinlan et al. 2012). 
Thus, initiation of therapy at early ages is recommended to achieve improved height outcomes ( Carpenter et al. 2011).  Interim data from a n ongoing study in children aged 5-12 
years has shown KRN23 treatment at doses up to 2 mg/kg Q2W  increases serum phosphorus 
and improves rickets severity.  The present study will enroll children 1 to 4 years old to 
determine if the PK and PD profile of KRN23 is similar in young er children who may obtain 
maximum benefit from treatment. The study will also provide preliminary evidence of efficacy in  healing rickets in young er children.

[IP_ADDRESS] Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established  for Study UX023-CL205 and will 
act in an advisory capacity to monitor the safety of KRN23 on a routine basis through Week  64 (Section  7.6.4). The  DMC may provide advice to Ultragenyx to aid in the 
determination of whether study enrollment should be paused or if the study should be stopped. If the Sponsor deems it appropriate to r estart the trial following an internal safety 
review, this will be done only following approval by [CONTACT_18332]. During the Extension Period, safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_492366] (SSRT) on an ongoing basis. 
Individual subjects who experience any unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely 
drug- related SAEs  (Section  8.5.3) that represent a change in the nature or an increase in 
frequency of the serious event from their prior medical history will be assessed as to whether the subject will continue on the study.  
Individual subjects will be monitored for ectopic mineralization by [CONTACT_872539] 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). If new or clinically significant worsening in mineralization is considered 
clinically meaningful by [CONTACT_1755]/or sponsor and related to study drug, the subject 
will be discontinued from the study. 
Regulatory Authorities, as well as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC) will be informed should unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely drug- related 
SAEs occur. A full clinical evaluation of the event will be performed in order to make a decision regarding what actions to take, including whether to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. Regulatory Authorities, as well as IRBs/ECs, will be informed if the study is paused or stopped. 
7.4 Treatment  
The study drug is  manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) regulations . The study drug should be securely stored under conditions 
indicated in the IB. 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218945]’s weight 
(Section  7.4.4). A ll subjects will receive KRN23 at a Q2W dosing regimen. Selection of 
doses and dose adjustments are described in Section 7.4.4. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_1218946] 
KRN23 is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative-free solution supplied in single- use 
5-mL vials containing 1 mL of KRN23 at a concentration of 10 mg/mL or 30 m g/mL . 
KRN23 will be administered without dilution  based on body weight (Section 7.4.4).  
Subjects will receive study drug via SC injection to the a bdomen, upper arms, or thighs; the 
injection site will be rotated with each injection. After proper training  by [CONTACT_872540], a parent or caregiver may administer KRN23 to the subject between 
site visits . Parents or caregivers will be instructed to follow the directions provided in the 
Instructions for Use. The parent or caregiver  must have demonstrated competency in 
administration of SC injections , including study drug preparation, administration, and 
disposal, and this competency be documented, before unsupervised home administration will be permit ted. Thereafter, study drug may  be administered by a parent or caregiver at home, 
except for study weeks that correspond to a site visit when parent/caregiver administration is optional. Study personnel should periodically observe parent/caregiver administration of study drug to ensure they are using proper technique. For subjects whose parent/caregiver is unable to administer study drug, study drug will be administered at the study site  or at home 
health visits for the remainder of the study. 
7.4.2 Reference Therapy  
This is a single -arm, open label study. All subjects will receive KRN23. No placebo or 
reference therapy will be administered.  
7.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned an identification 
number. All subjects will receive active treatment with KRN23.  
7.4.4 Selection of Doses  
The KRN23 dose planned for this study: 0.8 or 1.2 mg/kg Q2W  is based on Week 40 data 
from an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study (UX023 -CL201) that included 18 subjects 
(ages  5-12) receiving KRN23 at Q2W dosing and by [CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling extrapolated to 
patients aged 1 -5 years . 
KRN23, administered Q2W at approximately 0.8 mg/kg for 40 weeks, increased serum 
phosphorus by [CONTACT_5554] 0.7 mg/dL; increases of > 0.5 mg/dL were seen in 83.3% of subjects. No subjects experienced hyperphosphatemia even at upper doses of 1.3 mg/kg Q2W, providing a wide margin for safety. Serum 1,25(OH)
2D concentrations and TmP/GFR 
levels also increased, demonstrating overall improved phosphorus homeostasis. The 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment 2

Confidential  Page 41 
increases in serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D were sufficient to provide substantial healing 
of rickets (as assessed by [CONTACT_872529] -C) in 8 of 9 subjects (88.9%) with more severe rickets (total 
RSS ≥ 1.5).  
Similar increases in serum phosphorus were extrapolated fo r younger patients (ages 1 to 
5 years) as estimated by [CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling. In simulations of a KRN23 starting dose of 
0.8 mg/kg, median minimum serum phosphorus chan ges from baseline are predicted to be 
0.830 mg/dL in patients  aged 1 to 5 years. In simulations of a KRN23 escalated dose of 
1.2 mg/kg, median minimum serum phosphorus changes fr om baseline are predicted 
0.873 mg/dL in patients  aged 1 to 5 years. Up to 95% of patients  aged [ADDRESS_1218947] 0.5 mg/dL in serum phosphorus at the 
proposed dose. As was seen in Study UX023-CL201, these serum phosphorus increases are expected to be sufficient t o improve bone disease in most pediatric patients  administered 
KRN23 at the proposed dose and regimen. 
Thus, a ll subjects will receive KRN23 at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The dose may be 
increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time if a subject meets the following dose adjustment criteria: 
1) two consecutive serum phosphorus measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum phosphorus has increased by < 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of study drug that would account for the decrease in serum phosphorus.  
At any time during the study, if serum phosphorus increases above the ULN for age, the 
subsequent dose(s) will be withheld and the site will contact [CONTACT_941] m edical monitor before 
dosing resumes. Once other causes of increased serum p hosphorus are excluded, KRN23 
treatment will resume at half the total dose of the last dose received. Serum phosphorus will be followed through unscheduled serum phosphorus assessments. A subject will resume dosing at the previous full total dose level if they meet the same dose -adjustment criteria 
listed above.  
Dose adjustments may also be made based on the weight of the subject (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Any dose changes needed during the Extension Period will be implemented at clinic visits.

medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care, except those listed in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  All concomitant medications taken during the study will be 
recorded in the CRF with indication, dose information, and dates of administration. Any changes to concomitant medication will also  be documented. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medications  
Medications that are known to affect bone or calcium and phosphorus metabolism will be prohibited during the study. Thus, to be eligible for the study, subjects must agree to

discontinue and/or not to use certain medications prior to randomization  and for the duration 
of the study .  
• Pharmacologic vitamin D metabolites or analogs (e.g. , calcitriol, alfacalcid ol) (7- day 
washout required)  
• Oral phosphate ( 7-day washout required)  
• Adjunctive growth hormone  
• Aluminum hy droxide antacids (e.g. , Maalox® and Mylanta®) or thiazide  
• Bisphosphonate therapy  
• Chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (short courses acceptable if indicated)  
• Parathyroid hormone suppressors (e.g. Sensipar®, cinacalcet, calcimimetics)  
• Any mAb therapy (other than study drug)  
NOTE : Oral phosphate treatment must be down- titrated slowly to avoid hypercalciuria. 
Vitamin D metabolites or analogs may be discontinued without titration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Medications  
Other than the medications specifica lly prohibited in this protocol, subjects may receive 
concomitant medications as required. If serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels fall 
below 20 ng/mL, oral supplementation with non- active vitamin D formulations may be 
provided. Medications (investig ational, prescription, over -the-counter, and herbal) and 
nutritional supplements taken during the 30 days prior to Screening visit will be reviewed 
and recorded.  
7.4.6 Treatment Compliance  
Each administration of study drug will be recorded on the CRF. Parents or  caregivers 
administering study drug will be instructed to follow the directions provided in the 
Instructions for Use. If a parent/caregiver is administering study drug, c onfirmation of dosing 
will be communicated to the study site during scheduled biweekl y telephone visits ; site 
personnel will record the related information about each administration of study drug on the 
CRF.  If the parent or caregiver fails proper administration at any time, the investigator has 
discretion, in consultation with the Sponsor , to have the subject return to the site for 
subsequent study drug administration or reinstate home health  visits  for home administration.  
Empty vials will be returned to the study site for drug accountability records. 
If a subject does not receive a dose  within 10 days of a scheduled dose, that dose should be 
skipped and the next dose will be administered at the next scheduled dosing visit . 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218949] meets the 
eligibility criteria. Blood for PHEX mutation analysis will be collected for all subjects at the 
Screening Vi sit.  
Potential subjects with a previously identified  PHEX mutation  or variant of uncertain 
significance in either self or a family member with appropriate X -linked inheritance and 
confirmed rickets severity eligibility by [CONTACT_175207]  (required for at least 5 subjects) may 
proceed to Baseline without waiting for the PHEX  mutation analysis result. Potential subjects 
without a previously identified  PHEX mutation will be notified of PHEX mutation results, 
and if presence of a mutation is confirmed, will have the baseline visit scheduled.   
Subjects who successfully pass the requirements at  the Screening Visit will discontinue oral 
phosphate for a minimum of 7 days and active vitamin D therapy  for a minimum of 7 days 
prior to the Baseline visit. The remaining screening assessments to confirm eligibility will be 
performed . At Screening/Baseli ne, renal ultrasound, ECG, and x- rays may be performed  
± 3 days of the clinic visit to accommodate scheduling availability. All Screening/Baseline 
assessments and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be satisfied prior to dosing.  
Clinic visits  will occur at approximately 4 -week  intervals (± 3 days) for the first 24 weeks of 
the study. Thereafter, clinic visits will occur every 8 weeks (± 3 days)  for the remainder of 
the Treatment Period .  During the Treatment Period, s ubjects may be monitored and dosed 
between site visits through a series of home health visits  depending on the preference of the 
subject and the proximity of the subject to the site. The visit window for home health  visits is 
± 3 days.   
During the E xtension Period, clinic visits will occur at approximately 12 -week intervals 
(±5 days). B iweekly home health visits or telephone visits  will be conducted (±5 days) for 
administration of or to  confirm  administration of study drug, and for collection of AE s and 
conc omitant medication information.  
For subjects who discontinue prior to completing the study, every reasonable effort should be 
made to perform the Early Termination visit procedures within 4 weeks of discontinuation. X-rays of the wrists and knees will not be performed at the Early Termination visit if 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218950] been performed within 3 months (hands/wrists and knees) or 
6 months (standing long legs) of Early Termination.  
A follow- up safety telephone call will take place 5 weeks  (+ 5 days) after the Week [ADDRESS_1218951] 10 weeks ±  5 days (approximately 
5 times the elimination half -life) after the ET visit for those subjects who discontinue 
treatment  before the Week [ADDRESS_1218952] s who complete the Week 160 visit 
and do not continue on KRN23  through commercial use or another mechanism . This safety 
visit will not occur for subjects who complete the Week 160 visit and are documented to be continuing on KRN23 on commercial use or through another mechanism.  
7.5.2 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
KRN23 binds to and inhibits FGF23, which is an important regulator of serum phosphorus 
levels. Serum phosphorus levels will be measured as a key PD assessment  in this study. 
Serum 1,25(OH)
2D, urinary phosphorus, and serum  levels of ALP  will also be assessed to 
determine the PD profile of KRN23 in children 1-4 years old.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serum Phosphorus  
Serum samples will be obtained following a minimum fasting time of 4 hours and prior to 
study drug administration (if applicable). Samples should be obtained in the morning at 
approximately the same time for each visit due to known fluctuations in serum phosphorous 
levels associated with circadian rhythm. The time of sample collection and the duration of 
fasting  will be noted on the CRF. Subjects who live more than 45 minutes from the site may  
stay overnight on the night before the site visit to facilitate fasting sample collection.  
Serum phosphorus levels will be assessed by t he local lab at Baseline for eligibility ; a second 
sample will be sent to the central laboratory for the  Baseline measure. Serum phosphorus 
levels will also be determined by [CONTACT_872541] 1, 4, 8, 12, 15, 20, 32, 40, 48, 
56, 64, and every 12 weeks thereafter through Week 160 (or Early Termination ) and at the 
Safety Visit (if applicable) . Where possible, the blood sample obtained for serum phosphorus 
will be assessed as part of the standard clinical laboratory safety tests  (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) to 
reduce the number and volume of blood draws. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for 
additional details on serum phosphorus measurements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Pharmacodynamic Markers  
To demonstrate the positive impact of KRN23 on bone metabolism and phosphate 
homeostasis, additional PD markers will be assessed, including serum 1,25(OH) 2D and  
urinary phosphorus. These measures will directly reflect the mechanism by [CONTACT_492393]23 restores phosphorus homeostasis by [CONTACT_492394]23.

Fasting spot urine will be used for measurements of urinary phosphorus, creatinine, and 
calcium. Spot urine collection will be performed pre- treatment at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 
12, 15, 20, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64, 112, 160/ Early Termination  and at the Safety Visit  (if 
applicable)  as indicated in the Schedules of Events ( Table 2.1, Table 2.2 and  Table 2.3).  
Urine samples  will be sent to the central lab  for analysis . The duration of fasting time for all 
PD parameters will be recorded on the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serum Alkaline Phosphatase  
Children with XLH have low bone turnover as a result of chronic hypophosphatemia. Serum 
levels of alkaline phosphatase will be measured at Baseline and at Week s 20, 40, 64, 112, 
and 160/ Early Termination  visits  as indicated in the Schedules of Events ( Table 2.1,

The clinical efficacy measures to be evaluated in this study will seek to determine the ability 
of KRN23 treatment to achieve these goals.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Radi ographs 
Bilateral anteroposterior (AP) knee radiographs will be taken at the Screening Visit to 
confir m eligibility and at the Week 40 , Week 64 , Week 112, and Week 160 (or Early 
Termination ) visits. Screening knee radiographs will be read centrally; an RSS  score of at 
least 1.[ADDRESS_1218954] 5 subjects . Bilateral 
posteroanterior (PA) hand/wrist radiographs will be taken at Baseline and at the Week 40, 64, 
112, and 160 (or Early Termination, if applicable) study v isits. Standing long- leg radiographs 
will be taken at Baseline , Week 40, 64, 112, and 160 (or Early Termination, if applicable). 
Knee and  hand/wrist radiographs will be taken at Early Termination if post- baseline 
radiographs have not been obtained within [ADDRESS_1218955] not been 
obtained within 6 months of termination . Radiographs will be read centrally and will be 
interpreted. Changes in the severit y of rickets and epi[INVESTIGATOR_766887] (growth plate) abnormalities 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_872542] , a disease- specific qualitative 
Radiograph Global Impression of Change (RGI- C) scoring system  and the RSS method.  
A disease- specific qualitativ e RGI -C scoring system will be used. Pairs of wrist, knee and 
standing long leg images from treated subjects will be presented to a rater with the Screening /Baseline  image on the left and the later image (Week 40 or 64, or Early 
Termination ) on the right. Raters will be asked to assess change in rickets severity in the 
wrists and knees and extent of bowing in the legs using a 7 -point ordinal RGI- C scale score 
ranging from -3 (very much worse, or severe worsening of rickets) to +3 (very much better, 
or complete or near complete healing of rickets). Ratings will be performed by 3 independent pediatric radiologists. X -ray pairs will be presented for review in random order and the

severity of nutritional rickets in the wrists and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal 
fraying and cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_872523] (Thacher et al. 2000) . 
With the RSS method, each radiograph is scored individually by a central rater who is blinded to subject number and radiograph sequence. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Growth  
Short stature is one of the predominant features in growing children with XLH. Growth of 
the legs and trunk has been shown to be uncoupled in XLH and related to serum phosphate levels  (Zivicnjak et al. 2011). Growth will be measured by [CONTACT_872543]  (and percentiles) prior to and following treatment. Recumbent length will 
be measured in subjects <2 years old or those unable or unwilling to stand for the measurement. Standing height /recumbent length  measurements prior to treatment will be 
abstracted f rom medical records where available. To assess growth during KRN23 treatment, 
recumbent length/standing height will be measured by a clinical evaluator at Baseline and 
Weeks 12, 24, 40 and 64, at 24 -week intervals during the Extension Period, and at the 
Week 160 (or Early Termination) visits. Historical growth records may  be used to evaluate 
change in growth velocity .  
7.5.4 Pharmac okinetic Assessment  
To assess KRN23 concentration and allow evaluation of the PK/PD relationship in children aged 1 -4 years , serum KRN23 levels will be evaluated as a PK parameter in this study. 
A blood sample will be obtained prior to dosing (if applicable) at Weeks 1, 4, 12 and 40, 64, 
and at the Week 160 (or Early Termination) visit. For each sample collection, the time elapsed since last study drug administration will be determined .  
7.5.5 Safety Measurements  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5205], frequency, and severity of AEs and SAEs, 
including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled time points in vital signs, weight, and physical examination, GFR, clinical laboratory evaluations (including additional KRN23/XLH biochemical parameters of interes t such as serum calcium, intact parathyroid 
hormone ( iPTH ), 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)
2D), amylase, lipase , and creatinine;  and 
urinary calcium and creatinine), concomitant medications , and ECG . Ectopic mineralization 
safety assess ments include renal ultrasound. The development of anti-KRN23 antibodies and 
dose limiting toxicitie s (DLTs) will also be assessed.

will also be recorded . The review will also include an assessment of symptoms and 
conditions associated with XLH and SOC  (e.g., oral phosphate/active vitamin D) treatment.  
Subjects must be willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of 
biochemical and radiographic data, as well as disease history. The specific diagnosis of XLH will be recorded, along with date of onset, clinical presentation, and date and method of diagnosis. Any available family history of XLH will be noted, including any avai lable 
previous PHEX mutation analysis results for the subject or relevant family members with appropriate X -linked inheritance pattern.  
XLH treatment history and relevant concomitant medications will be recorded (start date, stop date, dose, dose regimen). Previous treatments may include calcitriol and oral phosphate and/or other adjunctive therapy. Medications include investigational, prescription, over-the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements. Any relevant concomitant therapy, including physical/o ccupational therapy will be recorded. Use of pain medications will also 
be recorded.  Refer t o Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for prohibited medications during the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will be obtained as indicated in the Schedule s of Events ( Table 2.1, 
Table 2.2, and Table 2.3). Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate in beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11808], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Blood pressure  measurements will be obtained only in children aged [ADDRESS_1218957] turns 3 years of age and will only be obtained at clinic visits.  
Vital signs measured at home health visits will include heart rate in beats pe r minute and 
temperature (°C).  
US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for Blood Pressure Measurement in Children will be used as a reference for BP measurement ( NHLBI 2005 ).  
Subjects will be  instructed to refrain from exercise for at least [ADDRESS_1218958] BP until all measurements are obtained. At each study visit, before BP determination, arm circumference is measured (in centimeters) with a plastic measuring tape at the midpoint of the upper arm between the acromium (tip of shoulder) and olecranon (tip of elbow) and a cuff is then selected so that the length of the cuff bladder is equal to 80% to 100% of the arm circumference. Effort should be made to use the same BP measuring device for subsequent BP measurements during site visits.  After

Confidential  Page 48 
recordin gs for the Screening Visit (one being the average of the first 3 BP recordings at the 
beginning of the visit and the second, the average of the additional 3 BP recordings at the end 
of the study visit). At  the baseline and  post-baseline visits, 3 BP measurements 30 seconds 
apart, should be obtained at  the beginning of the study visit.  The average of the three BP 
measurements is recorded as the participant’s BP for the study visit.   
In addition, after subjects are deemed eligible to participate in the study,  if available , 
historical BP measurements will be obtained from the subjects’ medical records and documented in the past medical history BP recordings section of case report form.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight  
Weight will be obtained using a scale and recorded in kilograms at specified site visits  
(Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3). W eight measurements  will be used to calculate the 
appropriate KRN23 dose to be administered. Weight from the previous site  visit will be used 
to calculate KRN23 dose. [IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will be performed at Screening , Baseline, and at the 
Week  24, 40, and 64 study visits , at 12-week intervals during the Extension Period (or at 
Early Termination) , and at the Safety Visit  (if applicable) . Physical examinations will include 
assessments of general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the cardiovascular, 
dermatologic, lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. The genitourinary exam scope should be non-invasive , as per age-
appropriate standard of care, and at the investigator’s discretion based on clinical judgement.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Ultrasound and Glomerular Filtrat ion Rate  
Renal ultrasounds will be conducted at Screening  and the Week  40, 64, and  160 (or Early 
Termination ) visit.  
Baseline and all post -treatment renal ultrasounds will be evaluated by a trained central reader 
blinded to subject data to evaluate changes in calcifications and all other renal abnormalities 
from baseline (i.e. screening assessment). Ultrasonographic find ings of nephrocalcinosis will 
be graded on a 5-point scale ( Verge et al. 1991). 
The eGFR will be calculated by [CONTACT_872544] ( Schwartz et al. 2009 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
A standardized 12- lead ECG will measure PR, QRS, QT, and QTc at Baseline and Weeks 12, 
40, and 64, and at the Week 160 (or Early Termination ) visit. The goal is to evaluate both for 
changes associated with LVH, as well as for changes in conductivity and intervals. ECG 
administration procedures will be standardized and results will be read centrally  by [CONTACT_872545]:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218961] data. The ECG results will be assessed for any clinically 
significant abnormality or relevant changes from baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests for Safety  
A comprehensive serum metabolic panel (Chem -20), complete blood count, and urinalysis 
(when possible) will be used as routine screens to assess KRN23 safety. Certain analytes (i.e., serum phosphorus) in the routine Chem- 20 panel are also designated as PD/efficacy 
parameters in this study. Additional KRN23/XLH biochemical parameters of interest include serum 1,25(OH)
2D, calcium, creatinine, and iPTH; and urinary phosphorus, calcium, and 
creatinine.  
Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening and regular intervals throughout the study as indicated in the Schedules of Events ( Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3).  
Fasting for a minimum of 4 hours is required prior to each blood draw or urine collection; the duration of fasting will be recorded on the CRF. Subjects who live more than 45 minutes from the site may stay  overnight on the night before the site visit to facilitate fasting sample 
collection.  Clinical laboratory parameters to be assessed for safety are provided in

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Anti -KRN23 Antibody Testing 
To determine the immunogenicity profile of KRN23 in children aged 1- 4 years  with XLH, 
blood samples will be obtained for anti-KRN23 antibody ( ADA) testing at Baseline and 
Weeks 4, 12, 40, 64, and Week 160/Early Termination  visits. PK samples will be obtain ed on 
post- baseline days of ADA testing to assess potential neutralizing effects if ADA are 
detected.  The formation of anti-KRN23 antibodies in human serum will be determined using 
a validated  ECLA and a 2 -tiered strategy: screening assay and specificity c onfirmation assay. 
If the development of anti-KRN23 antibodies is suspected in a given subject, samples may be obtained at additional time points on a case- by-case basis, if warranted.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded from the time the subject’s parent/guardian  signs the informed 
consent through the final safety protocol- defined follow-up (telephone or visit). 
The determination, evaluation, reporting, and follow-up of AEs will be performed as outlined 
in Section 8.5. At each visit, subjects will be asked about any new or ongoing AEs since the 
previous visit. Assessments of AEs will occur at each visit to the investigational site , at home 
health visits , and at telephone visits.  
Clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory parameters, renal ultrasounds, GFR, and ECGs will be recorded as AEs or

KRN23 binds to and inhibits FGF23. FGF23 plays an important r ole in phosphate 
homeostasis, as such, serum phosphorus levels will be the primary PD marker of KRN23 efficacy in this study.  
Additional assessments are included both as PD measures and safety indicators of potential 
secondary complications associated with  treatment, including serum calcium, 1,25(OH)
2D 
and urinary calcium , creatinine , and phosphorus, as hypercalciuria may occur in the absence 
of hypercalcemia.  Intact  PTH (iPTH) levels are routinely measured as a part of standard oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D therapy in XLH, as secondary hyperparathyroidism is common. ALP will be measured as a biochemical marker of bone turnover, which may provide an indication of treatment effect. Where possible, timing of assessments has been coordinated with standard safety laboratory tests to minimize risk and discomfort and avoid unnecessary duplication of testing. 
Radiographs are routinely recommended during the initial evaluation of XLH, and to 
evaluate healing of rickets and skeletal deformities. Growth will be measured and may be 
compared with historical growth measurements to determine a change in growth velocity before and after KRN23 treatment.  
The safety parameters to be evaluated in this study include standard assessments such as recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistry, concomitant medications, and other routine clinical and laboratory procedures.

Routine, non- invasive procedures will provide relevant indicators of possible renal and 
cardiac risk ; renal ultrasounds will be used to detect any calcinosis in susceptible organs. 
Since elevated free FGF23 has been associated with LVH in patients with chronic kidney 
disease, ECGs will examine the potential risk in XLH subjects.  
The study will be conducted in a pediatric population;  as such , additional safety measures 
including home health care visits and a DMC have  been incorporated into the study design.  
Where possible, measures to minimize pain and distress to the subject have been considered for this stud y protocol. The maximum blood volume obtained throughout the Treatment 
Period  is estimated to be approximately 169 mL . Any unscheduled blood draws would be in 
addition to this volume.  
7.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
A general descripti on of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the  safety  and effi cacy 
of the study dru g is outlined below. The analyses planned in this protocol will be expanded in 
the statistical analysis plan ( SAP) to include detailed description of the analyses . The SAP 
will be finalized and approved prior to the database lock. Any deviations from the analyses described in the protocol and SAP will be noted in the clinical study report.  
7.6.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 10 children aged 1- 4 years with XLH  will be enrolled in the study. 
This sample size is considered appropriate to evaluate the KRN23 dose and PD relationship 
to confirm if the profile is similar in these younger children to that observed in older children (age 5 -12) in the Phase 2 study UX023- CL201. Preliminary clinical efficacy assessments will 
also be evaluated in this study. To demonstrate safety and efficacy in a controlled study, a larger randomized, P hase 3 study in children with a broader age range is being planned that 
will include tw o treatment arms: one group will receive KRN23 and one group will receive 
oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy.

The investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB/EC, and/or Ultragenyx or its designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least [ADDRESS_1218976] with retention should the 
Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject  files for the full 
[ADDRESS_1218977] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in

and unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
Suspected Adverse Reaction  is any AE  for which there i s a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE . For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE . 
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1218978] ed adverse reaction is an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that at any 
dose, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, results in an y of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or disability ( substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions ) 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819] -existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.   
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
The majority of AEs can be graded using this system.  
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, 
severe, life- threatening, or death using the following definitions. 
• Mild (Grade 1):  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical eval uation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate (Grade 2):  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences  may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
Protocol Number:  UX023 -CL205 
Protocol Amendment 2 
12 June 2017   
 
Confidential   Page 61 
• Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4):  Events that place the participant at  immediate risk of death 
or disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
"serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, t he following note of clarification is 
provided.  The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical  significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same 
as "serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. 
Categories of attributions for “Unr elated” events:  
• Unrelated:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure . 
• Unlikely Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
Categories of attributions for “Related” events:  
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure . 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure .  
• Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure . 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely  Related 
will be considered Unrelated.

[IP_ADDRESS] General  
All AEs (i.e. any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with 
onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on the CRF. The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, obtai ning supporting 
documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE must include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
All AEs will be collected from the time that the subject signs informed consent thr ough the 
final protocol -defined safety follow -up contact (telephone call or visit) . In addition, the 
Investigator should report any AE that occurs after this time period that is believed to have a reasonable possibility of being associated with study drug.  
AEs ongoing at the final protocol -defined safety follow -up contact (telephone call or visit)  
should have a comment in the source document by [CONTACT_528639], recovered with sequelae, or stabilized.

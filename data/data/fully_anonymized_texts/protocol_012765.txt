Monitoring Plan  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ivona Percec will oversee the study, protocol, and data 
monitoring and storage.  
 
Background and Study Rationale  
[ADDRESS_719485] never received filler injections . All subjects will undergo 3D imaging using the VECTRA M3 
(Canfield Scientific, Inc, Fairfield, NJ) prior to treatment with a Juvéderm  filler  in order to determine their 
baseline volumetric measurements  and dimensions. Imaging will be repeated post injection to determine 
change  over time  (over a 3 -month time period) . 
 
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
Juvéderm Volbella XC is a gel implant or dermal filler that consists of crosslinked hyaluronic acid made by a Streptococcal bacteria species intended to temporarily add fullness to the facial soft tissues. It was 
originally approved for injection into the lips for lip augmentation and correction of perioral rhytids . It has 
since been FDA -approved for injection into the undereye hollows to improve the appearance of undereye 
hollows in adults over the age of 21 [1].  
 The “Zoom Effect” describes the recent upsurge in demand for cosmetic procedures during the COVID -
[ADDRESS_719486] increased 55% in 2021 [2]. Soft tissue filler injections are the [ADDRESS_719487] increased 42% in 2021 [ 2,3].  
 
Undereye or i nfraorbital hollowing is a result of a loss of volume causing  shadow ing and darkness of the 
infraorbital region often interpreted as a tired, stressed, and aged appearance.  The Allergan Infraorbital 
Hollows Scale is a validated scale for objective and reproducible comparisons of infraorbital hollows

 before and after dermal filler injection [4]. The Tear Trough Rating Scale (TTRS) is another validated 
method of evaluating tear trough deformities that measures depth of trough, degree of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
prolapse of nasal fat pads/pockets, and lower eyelid skin rhytidosis  [6]. 3D photogrammetry technology 
allows for high level feature enhancement and microscopic anatomical evaluation that was not previously 
possible  and can be used to make volumetric measurements at injection sites to evaluating minimally 
invasive injection efficacy. [7 -9]. In this study, we aim to use these volumetric measurements to describe 
undereye volume after infraorbital dermal filler injection and further understand the behavior of the product in soft tissues over time.  
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to quantify and describe under eye volume changes over time after  
infraorbital hyaluronic acid filler injections.  
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
This study is a prospective case series /descriptive study – 10 patients will be enrolled to receive 
hyaluronic acid filler injections (Juvé derm Volbella XC).  Each patient will receive FDA approved 
dosages  of filler to the infraorbital region to treat undereye , as per FDA approved indications. All 
injections will be performed by a n Allergan -trained physician (Ivona Percec, MD , PhD ) according to a 
preset injection plan per FDA approved administration guidelines . Prior to injection patients will be 
imaged with [ADDRESS_719488] at the pre- determined time points will be obtained using the 
VECTRA M3 (Canfield Scientific, Inc., Fairfield, NJ)  which allows for volumetric measurements. Three-
dimensional coordinates will be calculated to generate each subject ’s topographic configuration, 
displacement, and volume  of each detected point on the surface of the face relative to its original 
reference image.  
3.4 Study Endpoints  
3.4.1 Primary Study Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is volume changes  of the infraorbital  area  over time after injection of filler  
quantified using 3D facial imaging measurements.

4.[ADDRESS_719490] Recruitment  
Patients will be recruited through the plastic surgery  clinic, which is a high- volume practice for those who 
may be interested in cosmetic injections.  Additionally, we plan to use of a f lyer posted throughout  the 
health system and campus. Filler injections to the infraorbital  region to reduce undereye volume loss  are a 
popular procedure and we do not anticipate significant difficulty  in recruiting about 10 willing 
participants.

7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_549680] a dverse event as the following: any untoward medical 
occu rrence associated with the use o f a drug in humans whether or not considered drug related.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classi fied as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of  major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159624].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events .  
7.[ADDRESS_719497], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
Infraorbital Filler  Study   Page 12

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will 
be recorded and reported immediately.  
7.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The relationship of each adverse event to the study procedures should be characterized. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_549678]:  
• likely related – a well -known effect of the device or clearly not related to the subject or 
environmental factors  
• probably related –  is known or suspected effect of device or cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_404551]  
• possibly related –  is a possible effect of  the device or can be explained  by [CONTACT_241892]  
• unlikely related – is not a suspected effect of the device or can readily be explained by [CONTACT_241894]  
• unrelated – is not a known effect of the device and can readily be readily and easily explained 
by [CONTACT_404552]  
7.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigators and the protocol sponsor (which may or may not be a Penn Investigator) must conform to 
the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible,  
 If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial rep ort includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention  
 Additionally , all other events (unanticipated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device 
effects ) and subject complaints will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal 
policies.   
 
7.4.1 Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.

 7.4.2 Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Investigators from all participating sites should report all unexpected and related adverse events, 
regardless of whether they are serious or not, and all unanticipated problems to the sponsor. 
 
Any study- related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse 
event, will be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event.  To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by [CONTACT_241895] 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study 
site.  Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_241896]:  [Evolus ., Company Call Center:  1- 877-

understanding of the event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be 
provided promptly to the study sponsor. 
7.4.3 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
For single and multi -site studies each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_404539].  
7.4.4 Sponsor reporting: Notifying Participating Investigators  
For clinical trials, in addition to reporting certain unanticipated problems and adverse events noted above 
to the FDA, it is the responsibility of the study sponsor to report those same adverse events or findings to 
participating investigators.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  
This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above. The lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_241883].   
7.[ADDRESS_719499] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

 9 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for 
formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor 
before commencement of this study.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.  The 
formal consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that 
subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent. 
9.1 Risks  
All treatments used in this protocol will be used according to the FDA approved intended use.  No 
unexpected risks should occur.  Risks/side effects of injections include skin infection, redness, swelling, pain, tenderness, firmness, lumps/bumps, bruising, discoloration, itching, and dryness .  Specific risks 
from dermal filler injections include unintentional injection into a blood vessel. This is a serious 
complication and may be permanent, although rare. Sequela of this complication can include vision 
abnormalities, blindness, stroke, skin necrosis or scarring.  
 There is minimal risk from the 3D imaging involved in this study to make volumetric measurements. The 
images will be identifying as they are of the face. All identifying images will be stored on a database or 
computer behind the firewall and a password.  
 Subjects should not be injected if they are allergic to lidocaine or Gram -positive bacterial proteins used in 
Juvéderm products or if they have had a previous allergic reaction to hyaluronic acid fillers.  
 
The product has not been studied in pregnancy or breastfeeding patients, so these patients will be 
excluded.  
9.2 Benefits  
Subjects participating in this trial may  benefit from  improvement of undereye hollows  from participating 
in this study. Although the benefits may not be readily apparent on an individual basis, the advancement 
of knowledge gained will serve the medical society and community.  
 There is financial compensation for participation in this study. Subjects will be compensated $15 for each 
follow -up visit and questionnaire completed. The payment will be administered after complet ion of the 
final follow -up visit for a maximum total of $45. The subjects will receive the dermal filler injections  for 
no charge.  
Infraorbital Filler  Study   Page 16 
Version: [ADDRESS_719503] is 
consented.  All subjects will be asked to return for four  follow -up visits for observation and surveys.  
9.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol fo r review and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal 
consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject 
undergoes any study procedure.  The subject, or legally acceptable surrogate, must sign the consent form, 
and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent. Subjects will be consented by 
[CONTACT_34355], or appropriate designee, in a room we have selected in which to perform 
consent, which is located outside of the clinic. Potential subjects will review the consent form in detail with the person designated to consent (either PI [INVESTIGATOR_160551]) and have the ability to take the consent home for 
further review.

 Secondary endpoint 
To evaluate the progression-free and overall surviv al of patients after multiTAA-specific T 
cell infusion  
3.[ADDRESS_1148085] nonetheless been identified, and these can be classified into 4 groups; 
(i) Unique antigens (eg. MUM1) result from single mutations that are tumor and 
patient specific and therefore are only expressed in neoplastic cells
1-3. They are 
often considered ideal for immunotherapy since tumor cells can be specifically 
targeted without destroying nearby [CONTACT_250868], and they may also be relatively 
strong antigens1-4. However, because they are also usually patient-specific, the 
identification of the mutated gene and then the generation of an individualized 
CTL product targeting the identified antigen is highly labor and cost intensive.  
(ii) The shared lineage-restricted antigens, expressed on tumor cells as well as their 
normal tissue of origin, such as the melanoma associated antigens MART, gp100 
or Melan-A. These antigens are also strongly immunostimulatory, equivalent almost to “weak” viral antigens, enabling the efficient and relatively simple generation and expansion of tumor-specific T cells from healthy donors and patients with minimal in vitro manipulation
5. However, T cell mediated destruction 
of normal melanocytes, for example, has res ulted in vitiligo as well as ocular and 
systemic autoimmunity in patients treated with melanoma-specific CTL or TILs6. 
(iii) Shared tumor-specific TAA (e.g. the cancer testis antigens [CTA] - MAGE, BAGE, 
GAGE, NY-ESO-1, SSX, PRAME) are expressed in multiple tumors including 
breast cancer but not in healthy organs7-11, with the exception of germ line tissues 
that are immune privileged and therefore not susceptible to T cell attack. Most CTAs have heterogeneous expression in cancer tissues and are frequently 
expressed in high-grade or late tumor stages, with expression often correlated 
with a worse prognosis. Furthermore, tumors expressing one CTA are also often found to express multiple CTAs, and several have been found to be targets of spontaneous humoral or cell-mediated immune responses
12-14. Thus, CTAs are 
particularly attractive as targets for tumor immunotherapy since reactive T cells 
can be produced on a large scale to provide broad-spectrum protection against a 
variety of tumors. CTAs have been targeted in both vaccine and T cell therapy 
protocols, with evidence of clinical efficacy15-21.

7 (iv) The last group of antigens are over expressed in many different tumors but 
expressed at low levels in healthy tissue (eg. hTERT, CEA and Survivin). T cells 
targeted to these antigens carry the risk of inducing collateral damage to normal tissues co-expressing the antigen (e.g. CEA and normal biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), and there are limited clinical data available regarding the safety of targeting these antigens in vivo . However, Survivin- and CEA-spec ific T cells have been isolated 
from the peripheral blood of patients who have cleared their tumors, and increases in Survivin-specific T cells in  patients receiving oncolytic viruses have 
been reported, suggesting that they can have efficacy without toxicity in patients
22-
27.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1148086] been described, with promising 
clinical results in some studies. Rosenberg and colleagues reported that infusion of 
melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) together with high-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) produced clinical responses in approx. 35% of patients with metastatic melanoma 
28-
30. The specificity of the infused cells was not analyzed but it is likely that they targeted 
multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]/tumor associated antigens. More promising results were subsequently 
achieved using a modified treatment protocol which incorporated a lymphodepletion step 
prior to CTL infusion, in order to improve the expansion and persistence of adoptively-transferred cells. Ninety three  patients with metastatic melanoma refractory to standard 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_827443] -/+ total body irradiation followed by [CONTACT_827453], TIL-derived, tumor-reactive T cells and high-dose IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg  q 8h to tolerance). Fifty two of the 93 patients had objective clinical responses 
to treatment (39 PR, 12 CR), including regression of large bulky tumors
31,32. However, the 
collection of autologous TILs is not possible for most tumors. Furthermore the in vitro  
expansion of large numbers of tumor-specific T cells (>1010 CTL) is a complex and expensive 
procedure.  
 
To extend applicability and generate a more defined tumor-specific product with respect to 
specificity and function, a number of groups have investigated the clinical use of tumor-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood and selectively activated and expanded ex vivo. Mitchell and colleagues used insect cells modified to express HLA-A2, CD80 and CD54 
and loaded with an HLA-A2-restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_827444]-expressed 
tyrosinase antigen to repetitively stimulate and selectively expand tyrosinase peptide-specific 
T cells. Infusion of 5x10
8 cells (of which between 10-30% were tyrosinase-specific) to [ADDRESS_1148087] used dendritic cells (DCs) to activate a tumor-directed product. For 
example, Yee and colleagues generated CD8+ T cell clones specific for HLA-A2 peptides derived from MART1 and gp100 using peptide-l oaded autologous DCs as stimulators. Four 
infusions (3.3x10
9/m2/infusion) of the tumor-directed clones without and subsequently with 
low dose IL2 produced clinical benefit in 8 of 10 patients with metastatic melanoma and IL2 was found to be crucial for in vivo persistence
34. A follow-up study from the same group 
incorporating a pre-conditioning step with high dose cyclophosphamide +/- low or high dose IL2 was shown to further increase proliferation and persistence
35. However, the toxicities 
associated with pre-conditioning followed by T cells with high dose IL2 were found to be substantial and recruitment on this arm of the study was halted. Finally, MART1 was also targeted by [CONTACT_827454], who prepared tumor-directed T cell lines using HLA-A2 peptide-

8 loaded DCs to stimulate selected CD8+ T cells. Eleven patients received at least 3 and up to 
10 infusions of specific CTLs (median 2.11 x 108 cells/infusion) with low dose IL2, with 
evidence of T cell homing to tumor sites detected and favorable clinical responses reported 
in 3 (1 complete, 1 partial, and 1 mixed response)36. 
 
Thus, while the generation and adoptive transfer of CD8+ melanoma peptide-specific T cells 
from peripheral blood has proven to be feasible, as in the TIL setting clinical benefit appears to be tightly linked with in vivo persistence, which has proven challenging. One potential strategy to overcome this obstacle may be to infuse CD8+ peptide-directed T cells with 
antigen-specific CD4+ T cell populations, which not only mediate tumor killing directly against 
HLA class II positive targets
37, but can support the survival and maintain the effector function 
of the transferred CD8+ T cells via the production of immunostimulatory cytokines and other signals upon antigen encounter. Perhaps a more general limitation of this peptide stimulation approach, however, is its limitation to individuals with a restricted HLA genotype due to the small number of class I-restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_827445] T cell activation. Finally, one emerging 
concern is the potential for such a targeted therapy to evade the immune system as was 
reported by [CONTACT_827455]1 negative tumors in 2 
patients infused with MART1-targeted CD8+ T cells
36. 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1148088] adoptive T cell transfer protocols were 
based on the premise that donor peripheral blood contained T cells that were able to mediate antitumor activity in vivo. Accordingly, unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have been extensively used to provide anti-tumor immunity
38. However, the efficacy of this 
approach is limited by [CONTACT_827456]-specific T cells and the relatively high 
frequency of alloreactive T cells, resulting in frequent and severe GVHD. One strategy to 
enhance the “graft vs leukemia” effect without promoting GVHD is to selectively target tumor-expressed antigens using selectively-expanded T cell populations and clinically the antigens which have been targeted fall into two categories: (i) minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) expressed by [CONTACT_827457], and  (ii) TAAs overexpressed by [CONTACT_827458].  
 
mHAgs are HLA-binding peptides derived from endogenous proteins in cells of the stem cell 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_827446], thus 
representing a unique class of antigens that can only be targeted after allogeneic HSCT to 
promote both GVL and GVHD effects in vivo.
39 However, much of the current research in this 
area is focused on identifying and selectivel y targeting mHAgs expressed exclusively on 
malignant cells. Warren and colleagues recently evaluated the safety of adoptively transferring donor-derived CD8+ CTL clones recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens 
(mHAgs) preferentially expression on hematopoietic  cells to patients with relapse of acute 
leukemia after myeloablative allogeneic HSCT
40. The highest doses administered to each

9 A3 (MAGE-A3) and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME)13,14. Of these 
WT1 is perhaps the most extensively characterized with several groups having defined CD4+ 
and CD8+ epi[INVESTIGATOR_304964], thus confirming the immunogenicity of this target. Its clinical relevance is evidenced by [CONTACT_827459]1-specific T cells, and an increased frequency of circulating WT1-specific T cells post HSCT has been associated with sustained disease 
remission. Based on these and other studies, O’Reilly and colleagues have recently initiated 
a clinical trial of donor-derived WT1 peptide-specific T cells, activated using DCs loaded with an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_827447] (15mers overl appi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 amino acids) spanning the entire 
sequence of the antigen, and infused as treatment of persistent minimal residual disease or recurrence of WT1+ AML, ALL, or MDS following allogeneic HSCT. In preliminary reports, T 
cell infusions at the lowest dose levels were reported to be safe, well tolerated, and 
associated with clinical benefit
41,42.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1148090] infused a total of 18 patients: [ADDRESS_1148091] received 2 
infusions of cells ranging from 0.5-2x107 multiTAA-T cells/m2 without adverse events. Of 11 
patients who were infused as adjuvant therapy all but 1 remain in remission (range 1-[ADDRESS_1148092]-infusion). Seven patients have receiv ed multiTAA-specific T cells to treat active 
disease. Of these, [ADDRESS_1148093]-multiTAA-specific T cells while the remaining 3 (all with 
HL) have had complete responses, as assessed by [CONTACT_10052]. Notably, since patients received no 
pre-infusion cytoreductive chemotherapy, these clinical responses can be attributed to the cells infused. Indeed, clinical benefit correlated with the detection of tumor-reactive T cells in patient peripheral blood post-infusion directed against both targeted antigens as well as non-targeted TAAs including MAGEA2B and MAGE C1, indicating antigen spreading. Thus, 
infusion of autologous multiTAA-targeted T cells directed to PRAME, SSX2, MAGEA4, NY-
ESO-[ADDRESS_1148094] administered these multi-antigen-targeted T cell lines to patients with 
multiple myeloma (n=5) and a spectrum of solid tumors including squamous cell carcinoma, 
lung cancer and osteosarcoma (n=4).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1148095] cancer 
Given our demonstration that (i) targeting NY-ESO-1, PRAME, MAGE-A4, SSX2 and 
Survivin simultaneously is feasible and safe, and (ii) these antigens are expressed in different 
stages of breast cancer including triple-negative breast cancer
7-11, we now propose to 
administer multiTAA-specific CTLs to patients with breast cancer. The CTL generation protocol will be identical to that used in our lymphoma study. In the current phase II study, we propose testing the safety and antitumor activity of these multiTAA-specific cells in 
patients with a breast cancer diagnosis at a fixed dose of 2x10
7 cells/m2.  
 
3.5 Potential adverse events  
Although no toxicity has been associated with CTL infusion in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we will actively look for evidence of potential side effects such as:

5.1 Blood procurement for CTL and antigen-presenting cell (APC) generation 
Generation of tumor-specific CTL lines requires the generation of several different 
components from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The CTL line will be derived 
from patient peripheral blood T cells, by [CONTACT_827461]-presenting cells (APCs) pulsed with pepmixes spanning the tumor-associated antigens SSX2, MAGEA4, Survivin, PRAME, and NY-ESO-1. The initial stimulation will be performed in the presence of the Th1/pro-proliferative cytokines interleukin (IL) 7, IL-12, IL-15, and IL6 and cells will be 
expanded in the presence of IL-2 or IL15. The APCs used to stimulate and expand the tumor-
specific T cells will be dendritic cells derived from patient mononuclear cells.  
 
For CTL generation, we will either use: 
* a mononuclear cell-apheresis collection procedure (for patients with ALCs <500) or  
* a maximum blood draw of 390 ml total, obtained in 1-3 draws over a 2 month period for 
CTL generation, testing for infectious viruses and HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. PBMC will be separated from 
whole blood using ficoll gradients. T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) can be 
prepared from fresh or cryopreserved PBMC. 
 To initiate tumor-specific CTL lines we will ma ke DCs by [CONTACT_827462]-derived monocytes 
with cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-4) followed by [CONTACT_827463] a standard DC maturation cocktail 
(IL-1 , IL6, TNF  and PGE1). These mature DCs will be pulsed for 30-60 mins with a 
mastermix of pepmixes spanning the target antigens PRAME, SSX2, MAGEA4, NY-ESO-1 
and Survivin. For dilution 1ul of each pepmix (200ng/peptide) will be added to 200ul Cell 
Genix/RPMI media and 50-100ul will be used to pulse the DCs ( ≤5x10e6 DCs - 50ul; >5x10e6 
DCs - 100ul). Subsequently the DCs will be washed once and used to stimulate PBMC-
derived T cells in the presence of a T cell activating cocktail, IL7, IL15, IL12 and IL6 at a responder:stimulator ratio of at least 10:1. For initiation, DCs will be prepared from about 
100mL of blood and the T cells will be derived from the monocyte-depleted PBMC fraction. 
 
To expand the tumor-specific T cells we will use pepmix-pulsed DCs for the second and 
subsequent stimulations and cells will be cultured in the presence of IL-[ADDRESS_1148104] was infused, the FDA and other

 We will use pepmixes produced by [CONTACT_827464]. These pepmixes 
are overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_558541] (15 mers overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 amino acids) spanning the entire 
sequence of each of the antigens of interest as per our lymphoma (TACTAL) study.  
 
5.2 Administration and Monitoring 
 
Patients will be evaluated in the clinic and 2 fixed doses of CTL will be administered 4 weeks 
apart. Patients will be monitored for clinical toxicity by [CONTACT_827465] (Version 4.X, See Section 13.3) with the exception of CRS toxicities that are 
related to T-cell infusions. CRS toxicities will be graded according to Appendix I. We will also analyze immunological parameters including phenotype and CTL frequencies by [CONTACT_827466]. This 
information will be used to determine the in vivo persistence of the infused product and whether multiTAA-specific T cells will be able to recruit the patient’s endogenous immune 
system as measured by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_145052].  Functional analyses (antigen-specific cytotoxicity 
and cytokine release) will be performed by [CONTACT_827467]/intracellular cytokine staining, respectively. The levels of serum cytokines before and following infusion will be compared. If needed, we will compare the infused product with the patient’s peripheral blood using TCR deep-sequencing. A time period of [ADDRESS_1148105] of the same cell dose or less (if there is not enough product 
available for the subject’s original dose) than their second infusion  
 
6.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of T cells specific for all 5 tumor associated 
antigens in a fixed dose study. 
 
6.1 Dose Levels  
 The patients will be treated 2 times 4 weeks apart at a fixed dose of 2x10
7 cells/m2. 
 
6.2 Dose Schedule 
 
This protocol is designed as a phase II fixed-dose study.  
 
Each patient will receive 2 injections at a fixed dose, 28 days apart, according to the 
following dose schedule: The expected volume of infusion will be 1 to 10 cc. 
 
Dose schedule:

   Definitions  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST 1.1) Committee
51. 
Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST criteria.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_1148117] or MRI. The same method of assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow-up. 
 Complete Response:   Disappearance of all target lesions 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started

9.1 Study Design and Sample Size 
 
9.1.1 Sample Size  
 
The primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate at 6 weeks after the second dose. Clinical benefit 
rate is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients with complete response or partial response or stable disease for ≥[ADDRESS_1148119] infusion (6 weeks after the second 
infusion) according to the RECIST criteria (see Section 8.4.1). This study is designed to 
detect an increase in clinical benefit rate from 5% to 30%. A Simon’s two-stage optimal 
design will be employed to test the null hypothesis that clinical benefit rate is 5% vs. the alternative target rate of 30%. A sample of [ADDRESS_1148120] 3 clinical 
benefit responses out of the total of 17 evaluable patients enrolled into the study, we will 
consider further investigation is warranted. The proposed sample size is based on testing the above hypotheses with 90% power and 5% significance level. This design has 63% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_827449] 12 if the true clinical benefit rate is only 5%. Taking into account a 20% drop-out rate for non-evaluable patients, we propose to accrue a total of 22 patients.  
 
9.2 Data Analysis  
 
Safety and toxicity outcomes, and laboratory evaluations will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Information on the expansion, persistence and anti-tumor effects of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CTL will be analyzed for the immunological parameters 
based on multimer analysis, intracellular cytokine staining and ELIspot assays to assess the 
frequency of cells secreting IFN  using the descriptive statistics such as mean, median, 
standard deviation at each time point. Comparison of diagnostic imaging studies from pre-
infusion to 6 weeks following the second infusion will be summarized. Frequencies, proportions and their 95% confidence intervals of clinical benefit responders (adjusted to 
account for the two-stage nature of the design) will be summarized overall. Overall survival 
and progression free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and 
summarized by [CONTACT_827470] 95% confidence interval. 
 
Growth curves of immune response over time within a patient will be generated to visualize 
general patterns of immune response. Pairwise comparisons will compare changes of these immunological parameters from pre-infusion to each time point of post-infusion measurements using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Longitudinal analysis is employed to model repeatedly-measured immunol ogic parameters. This will allow us to 
model patterns of immune response per patient while allowing for varying intercepts and slopes for a patient. The normality assumption will be assessed and transformations to 
achieve approximate normality will be carried out if necessary.  
 
If a patient has stable disease or a partial re sponse as assessed by [CONTACT_773398] (see 
Section 8.4.1) after the first two infusions, they may receive up to [ADDRESS_1148121] data on the survival, immunological efficacy and anti-tumor activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte lines after these additional infusions so it may be compared 
with results obtained after the initial two infusions.

patient develops Grade III-IV toxicity attributable to the CTL infusions at any time during the 
extended dosing regimen, they will not be able to receive any more CTL infusions.   
 
9.3 Analysis Set  
 
Evaluable for response: Only patients who receive both infusions will be evaluable for 
response.  
 
Evaluable for adverse events: All patients who received the first infusion will be evaluable 
for adverse events.

10.0 MODIFIED FOLLOW-UP AND OFF STUDY CRITERIA  
 
10.1  Criteria for Modified Follow-Up 
The following criteria will result in the patient being ineligible for further treatment on 
the protocol, although response data will continue to be collected as applicable.  
 
 
10.1.1 Any patient who develops grade > III infusional and/or organ toxicity 
that is NOT (1) pre-existing, or (2) due to infection or (3) due to 
underlying malignancy and is considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug. In such patients, the toxicities will be followed until resolution or their off-study date. Although no toxicity 
has been associated with the infusion of this product in patients with 
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we will actively look for 
evidence of any adverse events, such  as cytokine release syndrome.

16.0 Appendix I - Grading of CRS  
 
CRS Grading Scale 
Grade Symptoms 
1  Symptoms are not life threatening and require symptomatic treatment 
only (e.g. fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgia, malaise)  
2  Symptoms require and respond to moderate intervention  
 Oxygen requirement <40% or hypot ension responsive to fluids or  
 low dose of one vasopressor or Grade 2 organ toxicity  
3  Symptoms require and respond to aggressive intervention  
 Oxygen requirement ≥ 40% or  
hypotension requiring high dose or multiple vasopressors or  
 Grade 3 organ toxicity or Grade 4 transaminitis  
4  Life-threatening symptoms 
 Requirements for ventilator support or  
Grade 4 organ toxicity (excluding transaminitis)  
5  Death

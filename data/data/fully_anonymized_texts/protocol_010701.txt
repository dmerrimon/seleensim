1. Rationale for the study, area of current scientific concern and why the research is needed.  20 
 21 
Sleep Apnea is among the l eading sleep disorders in Veterans seeking VA healthcare32 increasing 22 
their risk for myriad adverse outcomes including poor physical health,5-6,13 -14 impaired cognition, 23 
higher risk for dementia,10-12,18 and declining mental health (i.e., worsening posttra umatic stress 24 
disorder symptoms,33 suicidal ideation,34 and lack of treatment responsiveness).34  Sleep Apnea is a 25 
treatable health condition that commonly co -occurs with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), which is a [ADDRESS_1090537]  Pressure (PAP) treatment17 [ADDRESS_1090538], and refine a clinical intervention designed to enhance PAP adherence 33 
with cognitive accommodations for persons with moderate -to-severe TBI .39  Should this 34 
intervention prove feasible, results will inform a future trial to determine its effic acy, with 35 
subsequent research to include studies on effectiveness, wide -scale adoption, and implementation 36 
within the VA. The clinical intervention results will be translatable to other populations with similar 37 
neurologic burden (i.e., stroke, anoxia, mild  cognitive impairment) and can be adopted by [CONTACT_39785] 38 
healthcare systems in the private sector and Department of Defense (DoD). Stakeholder Input : 39 
Improving PAP adherence in at -risk populations (e.g., TBI) are high priority research needs identified 40 
by [CONTACT_791121] -led initiatives led by [CONTACT_229334] 41 
(Future Research Needs Project)40 and joint collaboration between the National Institute of Health 42 
and Sleep Research Society.41 Further, input by [CONTACT_791122] (Tampa Veterans 43 
Engagement Council)42 was used in refinement of topic selection, study methodology, and 44 
refinement of the manualized intervention to maximize the research translation success.   45 
Sleep Apnea T x Adherence Intervention (PI [INVESTIGATOR_791117]) v [ADDRESS_1090539] study examining sleep 49 
disturbance in acute rehabilitation for moderate -to-severe TBI, we reported 84% of 205 consecutive 50 
admissions had sleep disruption of varying severity.27  During a time of critical neural repair, 63% of 51 
the sample rema ined sleep disturbed, 33% with moderate to severe sleep disturbance (i.e., several 52 
nighttime awakenings), near the time of rehabilitation discharge.27   53 
 54 
Sleep Affects Outcomes After Controlling for TBI Injury Severity . After controlling for known 55 
predicto rs of TBI outcomes (age, time elapsed since injury, and initial Glasgow Coma Scale score), 56 
we reported that the presence of persistent moderate or severe sleep disturbance predicted longer 57 
rehabilitation length of stay, prolonged posttraumatic amnesia (PTA ), and lack of improvement on [ADDRESS_1090540]. 59 
Silva’s work demonstrating that individuals with greater daytime hypersomnolence cooperated less [ADDRESS_1090541] -TBI sleep problems are 61 
associated with negative outcomes (i.e., prolonged impaired cognition, decreased benefit from [ADDRESS_1090542] of care).  [ADDRESS_1090543] consecutive series of 65 
patients admitted for TBI rehabilitation who underwent diagnostic polysomnography during 66 
inpatient rehabilitation to diagnose presence and severity of sleep apnea.2  Thirty -seven percent 67 
were diagnosed  with sleep apnea, a significantly higher incidence relative to the general 68 
population,29 and higher than estimates by [CONTACT_791123] -analytic review in TBI (25%).[ADDRESS_1090544] to re port on 71 
guideline endorsed frontline therapy (PAP)17 among Veterans and Military Service Members 72 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_791118] . In this study, 68% did 73 
not adhere to PAP treatment during a time of critical neural r epair.30  Examination of downloadable 74 
smart cards revealed that PAP was used 29% of the nights monitored with a median duration of one 75 
hour per night.30  This level of PAP usage is far below the recommended adherence guideline of ≥ [ADDRESS_1090545] 70% of nights.[ADDRESS_1090546] of care for the treatment of 85 
Sleep Apnea17 but on its own h as been shown to be ineffective in improving PAP adherence.22-23  86 
Alternatives include Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT ).  [ADDRESS_1090547] not yet been adapted to address PAP 88 
adhere nce in persons with TBI, who often require cognitive accommodations .39  Hence, it remains 89 
unknown whether these evidence -based interventions (designed for cognitively healthy individuals) [ADDRESS_1090548] the ability to improve adherence in, pers ons with moderate -to-severe TBI.  91

 93 
This is a 2 -year mixed methods43 study using quantitative and qualitative inquiry to determine the 94 
feasibility and acceptability of a novel 4 -session PAP adherence intervention  based on evidence - 95 
based MI and CBT, with cognitive accommodations for TBI (Aim 1). Feasibility  is the ease to w hich 96 
the intervention can be delivered (e.g., eligibility rates, recruitment rates), and acceptability  is the 97 
extent to which persons receiving the intervention consider it appropriate (e.g., satisfaction 98 
ratings).44-45  Feasibility of process and outcome measures (e.g., completeness, perceived value and 99 
burden)46 will also be examined (Aim 2).  We will explore preliminary response to the intervention 100 
by [CONTACT_791124]  (Aim 3) . There are no study hypotheses specified, consistent with [ADDRESS_1090549] -intervention questionnaires, and participate 110 
in an intervi ew about their experience of the intervention. Intervention sessions will be recorded 111 
and reviewed for fidelity. Data from questionnaires will be entered into a database for analysis. 112 
Interview data will be qualitatively analyzed.  113

when discussing the participant’s health and sleep apnea treatment. In the event of emotional 142 
discomfort, the participant may choose to discontinue the activity. Also, we can notify the 143 
participant’s current health care treatment providers or refer the participant to a physician or [ADDRESS_1090551] if the participant would like us to. We do not anticipate any financial or legal risk 145 
associated with this study. It is possible that there risks that are unknown to us.  146 
 147 
Safety precautions that will be taken to minimize risks/harms : Study staff foll ow VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361] [ADDRESS_1090552] copy data 149 
(data collection forms, recordings of counseling intervention sessions) will be stored in a locked 150 
cabinet s in locked office s (Bldg 38, Room C -253 and B -258). Data collection forms will not contain 151 
name, social security number, or other personal identifiers, with the exception of date of birth 152 
which is used to calculate  age at various points in time (e.g., at injury, at time of sleep apnea  153 
diagnosis, at time of study participation). Recording s will be identified using a unique ID number 154 
that will be assigned to each participant for this study – it will not contain name, social security [ADDRESS_1090553] access to research data . 156 
Electronic data (e.g., Electronic Data Set) will be stored on a secure folder on the VA server, behind 157 
the VA firewall , within R:/PROJECTS_CURRENT . The tracking form that links the participant’s 158 
identity to the ID num ber, and will be a in its own document, separate from the Electronic Data Set, 159 
which stores data collected as part of this research study. Research records will be maintained 160 
according to VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361].  161

 181 
There are approximately 6 visits which can be completed, at the participant’s preference, over the [ADDRESS_1090555] Benefits : None  190 
Societal Benefits : By [CONTACT_791125], there is potential that study findings will lead to 191 
improvement in the management of sleep apnea in persons with brain injury.  192 
 193 
13. Human subjects considerations : 194 
 195 
Inpatient TBI/Polytrauma records, outpatient TBI clinic records, and sleep medicine / respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] / 196 
pulmonary records will be reviewed prior to consent for screening purposes. Information to be 197 
gleaned will include those needed to ensure study inclusion cr iteria (TBI diagnosis, Sleep Apnea 198 
Diagnosis, prescribed PAP therapy, capacity to consent), as well as determine upcoming clinic 199 
appointments so the potential participant can be approached. Informed consent will be obtained 200 
from the participant by [CONTACT_978] o r designee (e.g., Project Manager or Research Assistant).  201 
Information about study purpose, procedures, risk and benefits will be reviewed. They will be 202 
informed that study participation is voluntary and they may withdraw at any time.  Those who agree 203 
will receive a copy of the informed consent document. The signed version will be stored in a locked 204 
filing cabinet in a locked office suite (Bldg 38, Room C -253 or B-258).  205 
 206 
Cognitive impairment is a common consequence of moderate -to-severe TBI. Participants ar e given 207 
the option to confer with trusted others (e.g., family members , their doctor ) prior to and during [ADDRESS_1090556] them via telephone a nd/or send reminder appointment letters to 210 
the phone and/or address of the participant and/or alternative contact[CONTACT_791126] 211 
participant. Although not specifically targeted, active duty service members who are being treated 212 
for TBI at the James A Haley VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (as part of a Memorandum of Understanding for specialty 213 
care between VA and DoD) will be recruited, as they are established patients at the James A Haley 214 
VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_791120].  215 
 216 
Participants will be assigned a un ique identifier. Participant -specific electronic documents will be 217 
named using the participant’s ID number, and stored on a VA server behind the VA firewall . Hard 218 
copy data will also be labeled using the participant’s ID number, and stored in locked cabine ts in a 219 
locked office s (Bldg 38, Room C -253 or B-258).  220

STUDY OBJECTIVES  
To determine the association of baseline FMISO PET uptake (tumor to blood ratio, hypoxic 
volume) and MRI parameters (Ktrans, CBV) with overall survival, time to disease progression, 
and 6-month progression free survival in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma 
(GBM).  
 
ELIGIBILITY  (see Section 6.0 for details) 
Adult 
patients newly diagnosed with GBM (World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV) and 
visible residual disease planned for initial treatment with radiation therapy (RT) and 
temozolomide (TMZ), with or without additional agents, will be enrolled. Amount of residual 
tumor will not impact eligibility and visible residual disease can include T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity.  
 
SAMPLE SIZE  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_254885] 
FMISO PET scans at baseline performed between 1 and 7 days apart (both scans completed prior 
to initiation of chemoradiation). The timeframe for recruitment will be approximately [ADDRESS_254886]  
This protocol for human research study is conducted according to [LOCATION_002] and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] 
Guidelines), applicable government regulations (e.g. Title 45, Part 46 Code of Federal 
Regulations) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) research 
policies and procedures. 
 
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and, unfortunately, most aggressive type of primary 
malignant brain tumor. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_212487], radiation, and temozolomide (TMZ) 
chemotherapy, median overall survival (OS) is less than [ADDRESS_254887] 
for a more aggressive tumor phenotype. By [CONTACT_212539], more effective and patient-specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212488]. For example, patients with persistent areas of tumor 
hypoxia may benefit from adding therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212489], are hypoxia-selective, or 
target downstream consequences of hypoxia, especially angiogenesis.  
18F-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET is a non-invasive method that can estimate tissue 
hypoxia. Several studies have validated FMISO uptake as a robust measure of tissue hypoxia, 
and methodology for FMISO PET imaging has been established in early single-center studies.3-7 
One preliminary study of 22 participants with GBM demonstrated an association with both the 
pre-radiation volume and degree of tumor hypoxia measured by [CONTACT_212540] a shorter time 
to tumor progression and survival (Spence et al 2008).[ADDRESS_254888] enhanced (DCE) MRI, oxygen breathing 
during BOLD imaging, vessel caliber mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or other approaches may also contribute to 
characterization of tumor physiology and/or prognostic information for patients with GBM. 
Combining such vascular-imaging methods with hypoxia data from FMISO uptake is very 
attractive. This also recognizes the mechanistic connection between hypoxia and angiogenesis 
and provides an opportunity to study the association of hypoxia, by [CONTACT_212541], and tumor 
vascularity, by [CONTACT_212542]. We propose using these PET and MRI techniques hand in hand to 
monitor the standard initial treatment of patients with GBM and to perform pi[INVESTIGATOR_212490] a useful prognostic marker in patients with GBM. Data gained 
fr
om this study will also serve as the basis for future clinical trials where hypoxia imaging could 
be used for correlative science, patient selection, and response evaluation. Both MRI and PET 
imaging are low-risk tests so the potential knowledge gained about tumor biology in this study 
makes it a worthwhile endeavor. 
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_254889] increased FMISO uptake while low-grade 
gliomas did not, which is consistent with the underlying biology of gliomas—higher-
g
rade tumors are more hypoxic than lower-grade tumors.[ADDRESS_254890] correlation between FMISO uptake and pi[INVESTIGATOR_212491].14   
Ex vivo  autoradiography has also been used to confirm the correlation of FMISO and 
tumor hypoxia.16 
2.2 Tissue:Blood or Tissue:Cerebellum 
The most predictive FMISO imaging markers for viewing these hypoxic distinctions have 
derived from tissue:blood FMISO concentration ratios, which compare image measures 
of tissue uptake concentration to blood concentration levels measured by [CONTACT_212543]. 
The Spence study3 showed that markers established by [CONTACT_48347],12 namely the 
maximum tumor:blood ratio in the tumor site (T/B max) and the hypoxic volume (HV, 
volume of tumor tissue with tissue:blood > 1.2), were predictive of patient survival. 
 
FMISO uptake is currently quantified using tissue:blood (T/B) ratios obtained from 
comparing image measures of tissue uptake to blood concentration from blood samples. 
This approach has been extensively validated against ― gold standard ‖ measures of 
hypoxia8,12 and has shown to be predictive of survival in GBM.3  However, this approach 
requires blood sampling and cross-calibration between the PET scanner and the well 
counter used to measure blood concentration. FMISO is highly lipophilic and fairly 
uniformly distributed in normal, non-hypoxic brain tissue; therefore, normal brain uptake 
may provide a reasonable proxy for blood concentration. Preliminary data from [CONTACT_212622]‘s group have shown a high degree of correlation between FMISO uptake ratios 
using the normal cerebellum as a reference region and indirect measure of blood 
concentration (T/C ratio) versus T/B. As a secondary objective of this study, we will 
correlate T/C and T/B as measures of FMISO uptake and test the predictive value of T/C. 
If T/C is shown to be equivalent to T/B, this would enable future use of FMISO by 
[CONTACT_212544], without blood samples, and eliminate the need for cross-calibration of the 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254891] in some tumors, FMISO uptake correlates with perfusion measures.17 The 
ability of MRI to assess perfusion and other hemodynamic properties of tumors makes it 
an ideal tool to combine with FMISO PET.  
2.3 Viewing Vasculature: MRI Complements FMISO PET 
MRI provides functional information as well as anatomical information about tumor 
vasculature. Cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and vessel size can be used to determine 
if a mismatch exists between tumor vascular function and hypoxia because these 
physiologic parameters accurately reflect the heterogeneous nature of gliomas. Changes 
in flow, vascular density, and/or the geometry of microvessels are all thought to regulate 
tumor oxygenation2 and can be measured with dynamic susceptibility MRI. Vascular 
permeability as measured by [CONTACT_212545] (the vascular transfer constant) or Ve (the volume of 
extravascular extracellular space) would provide further information about vessel 
function and the role that elevated interstitial fluid pressure plays in hypoxia.  
In one animal model of colorectal cancer, reduction in Ktrans and Ve correlated with an 
increase in oxygenation following radiation.18 In addition, breathing oxygen or carbogen 
during BOLD MRI has been shown to reveal dynamic changes in tumor vascular 
physiology.19,20 Therefore, the complementary information provided by [CONTACT_212546], which has significant clinical 
implications. 
Being able to better characterize and target the mechanisms of GBM hypoxia (e.g. 
hypoperfusion) could lead to improvements in therapy for this deadly disease. There are 
approximately 10,[ADDRESS_254892] treatment for GBM—radiation and TMZ 
c
hemotherapy—relies on adequate oxygenation to be maximally effective, a better 
understanding of tumor hypoxia and perfusion could optimize these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212492].  
Furthermore, if FMISO becomes a clinically valuable tool, measurement methods such as 
tumor:cerebellum ratios would be more convenient to use than the current practice of 
blood sampling and cross calibration. Hence, in this study we will seek to determine the 
feasibility of the tumor:cerebellum method compared with tumor:blood as we both 
elucidate the presence and mechanisms of hypoxia and assess the robustness of hypoxia 
imaging with FMISO PET.

chemora
diation alone or only with the addition of anti-VEGF treatment or an anti-PARP 
inhibitor is restrictive and unnecessary. Removal of the restrictive therapy-related 
eligibility criteria introduced in earlier amendments to the protocol (revised to be more 
all-inclusive therapeutically as of Amendment 7) will speed study accrual and increase 
the likelihood of trial completion.

4.1.4  Description:  [18F]-fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO, FMISO) is a radiolabeled 
imaging agent that has been used for investigating tumor hypoxia with PET. 
FMISO is an azomycin-based hypoxic cell sensitizer that binds covalently to 
cellular molecules at rates that are inversely proportional to intracellular oxygen 
concentration, rather than by [CONTACT_212548]. In 
hypoxic cells, FMISO is trapped, which is the basis for the use of this tracer to 
measure hypoxia. The physical half-life of FMISO is 110 minutes. 
 
4.1.5  Supplier/How Supplied:    
FMISO is available under the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Imaging 
Program‘s (CIP‘s) Investigational New Drug Application (IND) filed with the

Calculated total body dose for a 70 kg man injected with 3.7 MBq/kg was 0.013 
mGy/MBq; for a 57 Kg woman it was 0.016 mGy/MBq. Effective dose equivalents 
(EDE) were 0.013 mSv/MBq for men and 0.014 mSv/MBq for women. Ninety-seven 
percent of the injected radiation was homogenously distributed in the body, leaving only 
3% for urinary excretion. Doses to smaller organs not directly determined by 
[CONTACT_212554], such as the lens, were calculated assuming average total-body 
concentrations. The absence of tracer visualized in images of those organs indicated that 
 
ACRIN 6684 11 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  accumulation there was not increased. Expected EDE for a 56-kg female is 3.0 mSv (300 
mRem) and for a 70-kg male is 3.4 mSv (340 mRem). 
 
More recently, radiation exposure for radiopharmaceuticals has been expressed as the 
effective dose (ED).  The estimated ED for [18F]FMISO  is 0.015 mSv/MBq (see Table 1 
in Attachment A to the protocol). Therefore, for the maximum 7 mCi dose, the maximum 
emission exposure is 3.9 mSv.  
 
4.4  Monitoring for Physiologic Effects of FMISO       
4.4.1  Vital signs:  
Vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
will be measured prior to injection and at completion of FMISO PET imaging, 
and subsequently as needed.  
4.4.2   L aboratory studies: 
No routine laboratory studies are required to monitor FMISO use, but this patient 
population will have weekly complete blood counts and frequent serum chemistry 
as part of routine clinical care . These data will not be collected for the study.  
4.5 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated at each imaging session; AE monitoring will 
cover at least ten half-lives of the FMISO drug, or [ADDRESS_254897] appeared or worsened since the infusion of 
the FMISO. Participants will be queried for potential AEs: 
 At the time of injection;  
 B efore leaving the PET suite;  
 I f they call the site as instructed for any concerns during the 24 hours after FMISO 
administration;  
 B y telephone after [ADDRESS_254898]-FMISO infusion.  
 
The AEs that will be specifically monitored during and after the infusion include: 
localized discomfort at the intravenous (IV) injection site, pain, respi[INVESTIGATOR_046], 
blood pressure instability, flushing, dizziness, pruritis/rash, and any other symptoms that 
could be related to an allergic or anaphylactoid-type reaction. When an AE is reported, 
concomitant medication taken by [CONTACT_212555] 2 weeks prior to the event and/or 
during the time of the AE will be collected and documented. (See Section 12.0 for AE 
reporting requirements.)  
 
 
5.0 STUDY OVERVIEW 
A minimum of 50 patients with newly diagnosed GBM will be recruited. The trial will continue 
until accrual meets the target of 50 eligible and evaluable participants. ― Evaluable ‖ is defined as: 
images are completed; site deems all images adequate; and images pass initial quality review at 
ACRIN PET and MRI Core Labs. Inevaluable and ineligible cases will be followed per protocol 
(see Section 9.3). Although some visible disease is required for entry, the amount of residual 
tumor after surgery will not impact eligibility and visible residual disease can include T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity. The timeframe for recruitment will be approximately [ADDRESS_254899] scan; if only one scan is completed for any 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254900] substudy is incomplete. 
 
In this study, participants with residual GBM will undergo FMISO PET and MRI scans after 
surgery and prior to start of chemoradiation (baseline). The subset of [ADDRESS_254901] reproducibility of FMISO PET; 
this substudy will continue to accrue until [ADDRESS_254902] of care imaging for GBM per treating 
physician discretion, which will be submitted to ACRIN. Participants will be followed until 
death or the end of the study.

6.3 Recruitment and Screening 
Each institution will not enroll more than 15 participants to this trial.  Potential 
participants will be referred by [CONTACT_212556]-oncologists or medical oncologists, 
who will be made aware of the study by [CONTACT_16541] (PI). Potential 
participants will be approached and consented by a member of the study team.  
ACRIN will allow patients to join this trial who are enrolled also in trials using additional 
investigational agents even if the trial is blinded. However, ACRIN will eventually need 
to access unblinded treatment and regimen data (specifically, ACRIN will need to know 
details of the timing, dosing, and any interruption of the therapeutic regimen). The site 
and ACRIN may need to coordinate with the other trial‘s sponsorship to determine any 
necessary data sharing prior to patient enrollment to the ACRIN trial. ACRIN requests 
information about the participant‘s scheduled concomitant therapy at time of registration. 
Once eligibility criteria have been assessed and the informed consent is obtained, 
participants will undergo a screening process to further ensure eligibility. Screening prior 
to registration will comprise a review of pathology reports, postoperative MR images, 
operative reports, and medical history; general physical and neurologic exams; routine 
blood work; and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.   
 
 
ACRIN 6684 14 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  ACRIN will develop a trial communications plan that will describe the production of 
materials to aid participant recruitment. All materials used for participant recruitment will 
be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1356]‘s Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
 
6.4 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Both men and women and members of all ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. In 
confor
mance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993, 
with regard to inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research, the projected 
gender and minority accruals are shown below in Table 2:

7.0 SITE SELECTION 
7.1 Institution Requirements 
The potential sites for this study are ACRIN-approved institutions that also meet study-
specific qualifications. If a site previously has not been approved to participate in ACRIN 
clinical trials, a General Qualifying Application (GQA) must be submitted.  In addition, 
each institution must submit a Protocol Specific Application (PSA). The applications and 
form are available at www.acrin.org/6684_protocol.aspx . 
 
Potential site must have access to local or commercial supply of the FMISO agent 
according to the parameters of the NCI-sponsored IND.  This will ensure that the FMISO 
tracer arrives successfully to the site and can be handled appropriately. For any sites 
approved to manufacture their own FMISO, the site must provide CMC data to ACRIN 
regulatory personnel as part of the site qualification process.   
 
In addition, the sites will need to have a well counter appropriate for counting blood 
samples and providing estimates of radioactivity concentrations that are cross-calibrated 
to PET scanner estimates of radioactivity concentrations in the PET images; phantom and 
calibration procedures will need to be run as a pre-qualifier for the well calibration 
procedure (see Section 11.0, Appendix III, and www.acrin.org/6684_ 
imagingmaterials.aspx  for details). 
 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254909] MRI/MRS scan per protocol specifications (see Section 10.0) prior to 
being qualified to participate. Sites must also have PET scanners and MR images 
approved prior to the institution participating in the study. All scanner and image 
qualification materials are available at www.acrin.org/6684_protocol.aspx . Section 10.[ADDRESS_254910] be submitted to ACRIN Headquarters (via 
fax: [PHONE_4519], ATTN: ACRIN [ADDRESS_254911] Manager).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_254912] (IRB) approval for 
the protocol and informed consent form (ICF), along with a Form FDA 1572. (The ICF is 
included in this protocol as Appendix I). The investigator and the investigator-designated 
research staff must follow OHRP-approved consent procedures (Title 45, Part 46 Code of 
Federal Regulations), as well as those set by [CONTACT_212557]. Prior to 
registering the first participant, the completed Form FDA 1572, a copy of the IRB 
approval letter, and a copy of the IRB-approved, site-specific ICF must be delivered to 
the trial monitor for review and to be kept on file at ACRIN Headquarters (fax: 215-717-
0936, ATTN: Protoc
ol Development and Regulatory Compliance Department). 
  
7.3  Accrual Goals and Monitoring  
The ACRIN Biostatistics and Data Management Center (BDMC) will monitor participant 
accrual. Total target accrual for this study is 50 participants within a year. The trial will 
continue until accrual meets the target of 50 eligible and evaluable participants. 
― Evaluable ‖ is defined as: images are completed; site deems all images adequate; and 
images pass initial quality review at ACRIN PET and MRI Core Labs. Inevaluable and 
ineligible cases will be followed per protocol (see Section 9.3). Each institution will not 
enroll more than 15 participants to this trial.  During the recruitment period, accrual will 
be reviewed monthly with the intention of discovering and resolving any recruitment 
barriers. In particular, starting approximately one month after a site is approved to begin 
participant enrollment, the site‘s actual accrual will be compared to the average monthly 
accrual potential described in their PSA. If a site‘s actual accrual falls significantly below 
what is reported in their PSA, the Protocol Support Enrollment Committee (PSEC)  
comprised of the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_212496] a follow-up action plan 
to identify site accrual barriers and develop strategies to support the site in meeting 
accrual goals. 
 
The ACRIN Steering Committee regularly reviews the overall trial accrual and may 
request information about a trial‘s accrual performance to better understand general 
accrual barriers or issues. Accrual and safety information will be presented to the ACRIN 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at regularly scheduled meetings thereof; 
the DSMC may, at its discretion, re-evaluate the study with respect to feasibility or the 
need for additional participating institutions. 
 
 
8.0 DATA MANAGEMENT/ONLINE REGISTRATION  
8.1 General 
8.1.1 The ACRIN web address is www.acrin.org . 
 
 
ACRIN 6684 16 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  8.1.2 Data collection and management will be performed by [CONTACT_212558] (BDMC) of ACRIN under the direction of [CONTACT_212623]. The Biostatistics Center (BC) is located at Center for 
Statistical Sciences at Brown University in Providence, RI, and the Data 
Management Center (DMC) is located at ACRIN in Philadelphia, PA. 
 
8.1.3 Participant enrollment and data collection occurs through a series of 
pr
ogrammed screens accessed through the ACRIN web site to 
register/randomize participants, collect participant data, and maintain calendars 
of data submissions for each participant. By [CONTACT_212559], 
ACRIN has made participant registration, data entry, and updated calendar 
information available to clinical sites 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Each 
successful case registration is confirmed through receipt of an e-mail containing 
a registration/randomization confirmation and a case specific calendar 
identifying timelines for data and image submission. If the confirmation e-mail 
is not received, the enrolling person should contact [CONTACT_212560] 
a re-registration. A DMC contact [CONTACT_212561]. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_254913] been received, reply deadlines for queries about unclear 
data, deadlines for follow-up reports of adverse events, or changes in the 
protocol that change the data being collected or the timeframe. Updated 
calendars for each participant can be obtained 24 hours a day from the ACRIN 
web site. The research associate may use the calendar as a case management 
tool for data submission and follow-up scheduling.  
 
8.2.2 The investigative site is required to submit data according to protocol as 
de
tailed on each participant‘s calendar, as long as the case status is designated 
as open/alive or until the study is terminated. The case is closed when all data 
have been received, reviewed, and no outstanding data query exists for the case. 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_254914]. Case report forms will be available on the web site 
through a series of links. Each web form is separated into modules; each module 
must be completed sequentially in order for the internal programming to be 
accurate. The user selects the link to the appropriate form and enters data 
directly into the web-based form. As information is entered into the web form 
application, various logic checks will be performed. These logic checks look for 
data that are missing, data that are out of range, and data that are in the wrong 
format (e .g. character data in a field requiring numeric responses). Such errors 
will be detected as soon as the user attempts to either submit the form or move 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254915] be corrected before the form is transmitted 
to the DMC. The user will not be able to finalize form transmission to the DMC 
until all data entered pass these logic checks. Forms that are not completed in 
one sitting can still be submitted and completed at a later date. The form will 
remain available on the web until the ― Complete Form Submissi on‖ button is 
depressed.  
 
8.2.4 Once data entry of a form is complete, and the summary form is reviewed for 
c
ompleteness and accuracy, the investigator or the research staff presses the 
― Complete Form Submission‖ button on the form summary screen and the data 
are transferred into the clinical database. No further direct revision of the 
submitted data are allowed after this point. E-mail confirmation of web data 
entry is automatically generated and sent to the site investigator or research 
associate listing all of the data generated and just submitted. Should a problem 
occur during transmission and the e-mail confirmation of data submission is not 
received, the investigator or research associate should contact [CONTACT_212562]. 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_254916] seek another Internet Service Provider (ISP). On a short-term 
basis, the A
CR can serve as an ISP. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_254917] for Information (Z1 query letter) to the 
site RA or investigator specifying the problem and requesting clarification. The 
DMC updates the participant‘s data submission calendar with the due date for 
the site RA or investigator‘s response.  
 
8.5 Missing and Delinquent Data Submission 
In addition to providing the site with a data collection calendar for each case, the DMC 
periodically prompts institutions for timely submission of data through the use of a Forms 
Due Report. Distributed at intervals via the electronic mail system directly to both the RA 
and the investigator at each site, this report lists data items (e.g. forms, reports, and 
images) that are delinquent and those that will be due before the next report date. In 
addition to prompting clinicians to submit overdue data, the Forms Due Report helps to 
reconcile the DMC‘s case file with that of the RA and/or investigator. Future Due Forms 
Report may be sent on an as needed basis in addition to past due reports. The site 
investigator or RA may use the Forms Due and Future Due Reports as a case 
management tool. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_254918] the data file. No changes to the 
data will be made at the BC.  
 
8.6.2 Ongoing monitoring of data is performed to assess compliance with the protocol 
a
nd to look for unforeseen trends that may be indicative of procedural 
differences among clinical sites. If patterns are discovered in the data that 
appear to arise from causes specific to an institution, the BDMC will apprise the 
ACRIN Headquarters and the site of the problem, and work with the site, along 
with ACRIN Protocol Development and Regulatory Compliance (PDRC) 
department, until the problem has been resolved. If the BDMC, along with the 
PDRC, cannot find a resolution to the problem, it will be brought to the ACRIN 
Quality Assurance (QA) Committee for further discussion and resolution. 
 
8.6.3  In addition, the ACRIN QA Monitor will review case report forms and source 
documents at several different time points: after first few participants enrolled 
and during the conduct of the trial, including staff changes at the participating 
sites. In addition, the QA Monitor will review the initial and annual regulatory 
 
ACRIN 6684 19 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  documents and any revised regulatory documents. This monitoring process 
ensures protocol and regulatory compliance, participant‘s welfare and safety, 
and provides resources to sites for clarification to the protocol and guidance in 
completion of the case report form s.  
 
 
9.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 
The trial will continue until accrual meets the target of 50 eligible and evaluable participants. 
― Evaluable ‖ is defined as: images are completed; site deems all images adequate; and images 
pass initial quality review at ACRIN PET and MRI Core Labs. Inevaluable and ineligible cases 
will be followed per protocol (see Section 9.3). Each institution will not enroll more than [ADDRESS_254919] completed the series; after the substudy has been completed, potential 
participants will be consented only to the baseline scan. Focus will be on completing the baseline 
FMISO PET and MRI scans, and trial accrual will continue to reach targeted goals even if the 
test-retest substudy is incomplete.  
 
NOTE: All 
PET scans should be performed on the same ACRIN-qualified scanner; if this is not 
feasible, then the same model scanner should be consistently used for a participant throughout 
the trial if at all possible. All ACRIN-qualified scanners will need to be cross-calibrated to the 
well counter on a quarterly basis or as specified by [CONTACT_3455]. 
 
A global time reference will need to be used to record and report timing of dose counting, 
injection times, imaging start time, blood sampling time, and blood counting time. It is important 
that this time source be accessible for all modalities used in the FMISO PET study (dose 
calibration, well counter, etc). A portable stop watch or other time pi[INVESTIGATOR_212497] a 
minute and preferably seconds is recommended. 
 
NOTE:  For this protocol, ― P ET‖ may comprise PET, PET/CT, or MR-PET. Any scanner 
considered for use for the trial will need to be ACRIN qualified and approved prior to use. 
 
9.1 VISIT 1: Eligibility/Registration or Screening Log  
At the registration visit, the potential participant will be screened and confirmed for 
eligibility by [CONTACT_212563]-team designee prior to formal electronic registration*: 
 Obtain a signed IRB approved informed consent prior to conducting any study-related 
procedures.  
 Screen and confirm eligibility which includes:  
 R eview of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, pathology reports, 
postoperative MR images, operative reports, medical history,  
NOTE:  If patient had a biopsy only, postoperative MRI is not needed to 
assess residual tumor prior to enrollment. 
 C onduct mental health assessment (including Karnofsky and Mini Mental 
State Exam [MMSE] scores if these scores have not been completed within 7 
days prior to enrollment),  
 Perform general physical and neurologic exams including vital signs 
assessment, and  
 
ACRIN 6684 20 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   R eview routine laboratory studies, including creatinine levels for GFR if not 
assessed 28 days prior to registration.  
 Conduct a standard urine pregnancy test if the participant is unsure of her pregnancy 
status.  
 Report any scheduled therapy at time of registration.† 
 Obtain and send tumor tissue specimen that was obtained for the diagnosis of GBM to 
ACRIN designated pathology laboratory, if feasible; specific collection instructions, 
shipment, and processing facility information will be provided at the initiation of the 
trial and on the ACRIN web site: www.acrin.org/6684_protocol.aspx . See Section 
18.0 for tumor tissue specimen details.  
 
*NOTE:  When possible, individuals who are evaluated for participation in this study but 
are not able/willing to participate should have a Screening Log completed 
detailing the reason for non-participation (e.g., participant refused to provide 
consent, patient is ineligible, patient is enrolled on a competing trial, etc.). 
 
†NOTE: ACRIN will allow patients to join this trial who are enrolled also in trials using 
additional investigational agents where the treatment given is randomized and 
initial assessment is blinded. However, ACRIN will eventually need to access 
unblinded treatment and regimen data (specifically, ACRIN will need to know 
details of the timing, dosing, and any interruption of the therapeutic regimen). 
The site and ACRIN may need to coordinate with the other trial‘s sponsorship 
to determine any necessary data sharing prior to patient enrollment to the 
ACRIN trial.  
 
9.2 VISIT 2: Baseline—Pre-Treatment FMISO PET and Brain MRI With Contrast 
(Within 2 Weeks Prior to Initiation of Chemoradiation) 
Visit [ADDRESS_254920] be scanned using the same ACRIN-approved MRI and PET scanners used for trial 
qualification, using the same protocol-specific parameters consistently at each time point. 
NOTE: The contrast agents do not interact, so administration of FMISO followed by 
[CONTACT_212564] 110 minutes prior to initiation of PET scan is an acceptable approach to 
same-day imaging.  
 Assess participant for Karnofsky and MMSE scores (if not completed within 7 days 
of scan). 
 Conduct a pregnancy test per the institution‘s standard of care if a participant is 
unsure of her pregnancy status. 
 Evaluate creatinine levels for GFR (via participant record review or special testing if 
necessary) if not assessed within 28 days prior to Visit 2 MRI scan. 
 Obtain vital signs before FMISO administration and after completion of imaging. 
 Place two (2) IV catheters into the participant‘s arm veins, one IV catheter in each 
arm; one IV will be used to inject the bolus of FMISO, the other will be used for 
blood extraction. Blood must be drawn from the IV that was not used for the FMISO 
injection. For the FMISO injection, minimize the length of the IV tubing between the 
injection site and the vein to avoid FMISO being left in the tube. 
 
ACRIN 6684 21 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   Perform a saline flush following the FMISO injection.  
 Obtain blood samples at three (3) time points at 5-minute intervals (± 2 minutes) 
during the FMISO PET scan; see Appendix IV and www.acrin.org/ 
6684_imagingmaterials.aspx  for details. 
 NOTE: The first sample will be taken at 5 minutes (± 2 minutes) after the initiation 
of the emission scan. Exact time of collection is key for this protocol.  Time will need 
to be recorded from a global resource to be used throughout the study. Minutes and 
seconds will be recorded and reported. 
 QC the well counter (see Appendix III and www.acrin.org/6684_ 
imagingmaterials.aspx  for details). 
 Conduct same-day blood sample analysis; see Appendix IV for details. 
 NOTE:  Must note exact time of analysis (minutes and seconds preferred) using 
study’s global time resource for reporting purposes.    
 P
erform the FMISO PET scan per the imaging parameters described in this protocol 
(see Section 10.0 and www.acrin.org/6684_imagingmaterials.aspx  for imaging 
specifics).  
 Obtain steroid use/dose information prior to MRI. 
 Perform a brain MRI scan with Gd contrast per the imaging parameters described in 
this protocol (see Section 10.0 and www.acrin.org/6684_imagingmaterials.aspx  for 
imaging specifics). OPTIONAL BOLD SEQUENCE: Note that 0 2 administration 
and collection of 0 2 saturation levels are necessary with the BOLD MRI. Sites are 
requested to administer oxygen per site preference, at a minimum of 7 L per minute 
via nasal canula. If the participant is unable to undergo the administration of oxygen 
for a period of less than 10 minutes (e.g., because of a history of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease), then the BOLD imaging sequence should not be conducted. 
 Query participants for potential AEs. When an AE is reported, collect information 
about concomitant medication taken in the 2 weeks prior to the event and/or during 
the time of any reported AE. AE queries should be conducted by [CONTACT_212565]-
staff designee at the following time points: 
 At the tim e of injection;  
 B efore leaving the PET suite;  
 If they call the site as instructed for any concerns during the 24 hours after 
FMISO administration;  
 B y telephone after [ADDRESS_254921]-FMISO infusion.  
 
NOTE: Participant disease, preference, or scheduling needs may necessitate two days of 
imaging to complete the FMISO PET and MRI scans; however, each two-day imaging 
cycle will increase the participant‘s risk because an additional IV catheter will be 
necessary. This risk should be discussed with the participant. If two days of imaging are 
necessary, then both scans must be completed during the appropriate divergent period for 
each Visit (in this case, within that 1 to 14 day period prior to initiation of 
chemoradiation). 
 
9.2.1  VISIT 2A: SUBSET OF 15 PARTICIPANTS ONLY – Reproducibility Arm

used for trial qualification, using the same protocol-specific parameters 
consistently at each time point.  
 Conduct 
a pregnancy test per the institution‘s standard of care if a participant 
is unsure of her pregnancy status. 
 Obtain vital signs before FMISO administration and after completion of 
imaging. 
 Place two (2) IV catheters into the participant‘s arm veins, one IV catheter in 
each arm; one IV will be used to inject the bolus of FMISO, the other will be 
used for blood extraction. Blood must be drawn from the IV that was not used 
for the FMISO injection. For the FMISO injection, minimize the length of the 
IV tubing between the injection site and the vein to avoid FMISO being left in 
the tube. 
 Perform saline flush following the FMISO injection.  
 Obtain blood samples at three (3) time points at 5-minute intervals (± 2 
minutes) during the FMISO PET scan; see Appendix IV and 
www.acrin.org/6684_imagingmaterials.aspx  for details. 
NOTE:  The first sample will be taken at 5 minutes (± 2 minutes) after the 
initiation of the emission scan. Exact time of collection is key for this 
protocol.   Time will need to be recorded from a global resource to be used 
throughout the study. Minutes and seconds will be recorded and reported. 
 QC the well counter (see Appendix III and www.acrin.org/6684_

ACRIN [ADDRESS_254931] be able to capture and submit 
processed and raw spectroscopy file data. To ensure that the institution‘s scanners are able to 
perform the advanced imaging MRI/MRS sequences, all institutions must submit pre-
qualification test scans to ACRIN using the scanner that will be used consistently throughout the 
trial. These test scans must be protocol compliant in order to become qualified to participate in 
the trial. 
 
NOTE: All MRI scans must be completed at 1.5 Tesla or 3.0 Tesla; 3.[ADDRESS_254932]  be scanned using the same ACRIN-approved MR scanner(s) used for trial 
qualification, using the same protocol-specific parameters consistently.  
 
Detailed, vendor-specific technical parameters and site approval instructions are available 
via the ACRIN web site at www.acrin.org/6684_protocol.aspx . 
 
10.1.1 MRI Sequences  
Participating sites are required to complete all of the following MRI sequences for each 
participant for this FMISO trial (exact details available at the web site above): 
 Scout; 
 T1–weighted SE (pre injection) ; 
 3D T
2 Rare; 
 FLAIR; 
 OPTIONAL: BOLD MRI during transient inhalation of oxygen in the magnet per 
institutional standard of care (minimum requirement 7 L/min) using nasal canula; 0 2 
saturation levels will be collected during this sequence and documented; 
 Dynamic contrast enhanced images with associated T1 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; 
 Diffusion-weighted imaging; 
 Dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging; 
 Post  T1 3D–weighted (1 mm isotropic); 
 P
ost T1 –weighted SE ; 
 3D 
volumetric spectroscopy is preferred. 2D CSI spectroscopy is accepted. 
Additional details are available online. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_254933] agents in patients with poor kidney function and encourages education for 
participants in the signs and symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Sites 
should feel free to contact [CONTACT_212568] a given patient with respect to this issue. 
Each IRB must approve this study, including its gadolinium contrast dosage. Allowed 
contrast agents will be gadopentate dimeglumine (Magnevist), gadoteridol (ProHance), 
gadodiamide (OmniScan), gadoterate meglumine or gadoversetamide (Optimark), 
 
ACRIN 6684 27 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  depending on each site‘s clinical practice. We seek to respect individual site‘s decisions 
on the issue of choice of contrast agent, an issue that has garnered substantial discussion 
in the past three years due to the recognition of associated risks of nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis. The contrast agent will be administered at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (for dynamic 
contrast enhanced MRI) followed by 0.1 mmol/kg (for dynamic susceptibility contrast 
MRI) injected at 3 to 5cc/sec as is current clinical practice and only upon approval by [CONTACT_212569]. We note that one of the agents (ProHance) is explicitly for a dose of up 
to 0.3 mmol/kg (― triple dose‖ ); use of other agents will be under local IRB approval. 
Gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance) and gadofosveset (marketed as Vasovist in 
Europe) are not preferred in this trial because their binding to serum albumin may 
influence DCE MRI measurements in unknown ways.  
 
10.1.3 MRI Quality Assurance Review 
 All institutions must complete qualification procedures to establish an ACRIN-
approved MRI scanner prior to registering participants. 
 Qualification requires sites to submit for review one MRI and one MRS examination, 
performed per protocol specification using the parameters available on the ACRIN 
web site at www.acrin.org/6684_protocol.aspx . All submissions must include raw 
spectroscopy files (e.g. GE: P-files; Siemens: .rda files; Philips: .spar/.sdat files). Raw 
MRS data files can be transmitted to the ACRIN Core Laboratory via secure File 
Transfer Protocol (sFTP) directly to the image archive. All MRS submissions must 
also include an image demonstrating voxel placement. Vendor-specific instructions 
for locating and submitting raw MRS data can be found on the ACRIN web site under 
Imaging Requirements at www.acrin.org/6684_protocol.aspx . 
 
10.[ADDRESS_254934] been qualified by [CONTACT_212570]-specific instructions posted on the ACRIN web site at: 
www.acrin.org/CORELABS/PETCORELABORATORY/PETQUALIFICATION/tabid/485/ 
Default.aspx . 
 
A dedicated PET scan unit or hybrid PET/CT scanner is mandatory. The PET scanner must be 
capable of performing both emission and transmission images in order to allow for attenuation-
corrected PET scan images. The ability to calculate standardized uptake values (SUVs) is also 
mandatory. 
 
Serial scans of the same participant must be done on the same scanner for this study. 
The P
ET scanner must be kept calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer‘s 
recommendations. The scanner should routinely be assessed for quantitative integrity and 
stability by [CONTACT_212571] a standard phantom. For SUV 
measurements, this assessment should include a comparison against a dose calibrator to ensure 
accuracy; that is, a comparison of the absolute activity measured versus the measured activity 
injected, should be performed. 
The PET scanner calibrations should be routinely verified according to manufacturer 
recommendations. The scanner should be assessed regularly for quantitative integrity and 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254935] 
include the dose calibrator used to measure the doses of study participants to ensure that the dose 
calibrator and PET scanner are properly cross calibrated, i.e. the dose measured in the dose 
calibrator and injected into the phantom matches the results obtained from analysis of the 
phantom images. 
A quality control (QC) check must be performed at the beginning of the day for the dose 
calibrator and well counter, in accordance with the manufacturer recommendations. If any of the 
QC results are outside of the manufacturer‘s guidelines, the study must be rescheduled and the 
problem rectified before scanning any patients. 
Exact time collection is key to this protocol.  A global time pi[INVESTIGATOR_212498] 
a standardized measuring tool—such as a portable stop watch—throughout the trial for all time 
c
ollection. The time pi[INVESTIGATOR_212499], at the least, and preferably 
seconds as well. It will be used to collect time at dose counting, injection time, imaging start 
time, blood sampling time, and blood counting time. 
 
10.2.1 Pre-Scan Participant Preparation 
 There will be no deliberate fasting prior to injection for the participant of this study. 
 Participants are encouraged to be well hydrated prior to the scan. 
 Blood glucose measurement is not required. 
 Participant‘s height and weight must be measured using calibrated and medically 
approved devices (not verbally relayed by [CONTACT_2299]). 
 Vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
will be measured prior to injection. 
 
10.2.2 Injection of FMISO 
 Two IV catheter access lines (18 or 20 gauge is preferred) are placed, one in each 
arm—one for the FMISO injection and the other for blood sampling during the scan.   
 The dose of FMISO will be 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg) (maximum 260 MBq, 7 mCi) 
in < 15 mL. For the FMISO injection, minimize the length of the IV tubing between 
the injection site and the vein to avoid FMISO being left in the tube.  
 A saline flush should follow the FMISO injection.  
 The exact time of calibration of the dose should be recorded using a global time pi[INVESTIGATOR_212500]; the exact time of injection 
should be noted and recorded to permit correction of the administered dose for 
radioactive decay. In addition, any of the dose remaining in the tubing or syringe, or 
that was spi[INVESTIGATOR_212501], should be recorded. The injection should be 
performed through an IV catheter and 3-way stopcock.  
 AEs will be solicited in open-ended fashion (i.e., ― how are you feeling? ‖) at this time.  
  
10.2.3 FMISO PET Imaging 
 Single field-of-view emission imaging must begin 110 ± 10 minutes after FMISO 
injection. Imaging start time should be recorded using the global time pi[INVESTIGATOR_212502].  
 
ACRIN 6684 29 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   The participant will empty his/her bladder immediately before the acquisition of 
images.  
 Participants are imaged in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_212503]. Head 
immobilization procedures for PET imaging will be site-specific.  
 An att
enuation scan should be performed prior to emission scanning, or just after 
emission scanning if there is a problem before. The transmission scan should be a 
low-dose CT scan without contrast for the PET/CT or a transmission scan for PET-
onl
y devices. The transmission scan type, length, etc, should exactly match that used 
in the calibration and qualification procedure.  
 A 20-minute emission scan is performed.  
 During emission tomography, three (3) venous blood samples are obtained at 
intervals of 5 minutes (± 2 minutes). Blood must be drawn from the IV that was not 
used for the FMISO injection.  The exact time of the blood draws should be recorded 
using the standard global time pi[INVESTIGATOR_212504].  
 Whole blood samples of 1 mL each are counted (within 60 minutes of collection) in a 
multichannel gamma well counter that is calibrated quarterly, or as specified by [CONTACT_13989], in units of cpm/uCi (see Appendix III for well counter cross-calibration 
instructions and Appendix IV for blood sampling procedures).  
 The exact time that each blood sample is counted should be recorded using the global 
time pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  
 Blood activity is averaged and then expressed as uCi/mL decay corrected to time of 
injection.  
 Vitals signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
are measured again at completion of the FMISO PET imaging, and subsequently as 
needed.  
 
 
ACRIN 6684 30 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   
 
 
10.2.4 Image Reconstruction 
 The PET data will be corrected for dead time, scatter, random, and attenuation using 
standard algorithms provided by [CONTACT_212572]. 
 Image reconstruction will be performed as specified in the ACRIN certification of the 
PET scanner.

Image values are divided by [CONTACT_212573]/blood (T/B) values. This 
allows a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]- by-pi[INVESTIGATOR_212505] T/B activity ratios for all image planes. The number of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_212506] a T/B ratio > 1.2, indicating hypoxia, is multiplied by [CONTACT_212574]/voxel for the scanner to yield milliliter units to measure the HV, based upon prior

11.0  WELL-COUNTER CALIBRATION/BLOOD SAMPLING GUIDELINES  
Exact time of collection is key for this protocol.  Time will need to be recorded from a global 
resource to be used throughout the study. Preferably, minutes and seconds will be recorded and 
reported.  
 
11.1 Well-Counter Calibration 
See www.acrin.org/6684_imagingmaterials.aspx  for additional procedural details.  
11.1.1 As a pre-qualification measure, sites will need to demonstrate appropriate well-counter 
cross calibration.  
11.1.2 Well-counter cross calibration should be completed quarterly or as specified by [CONTACT_13989]. (Routine well-counter QC measures will still be necessary on the day of 
imaging/counting.)

www.acrin.org/6684_imagingmaterials.aspx . 
 
11.2 Blood Sampling 
See Appendix IV for additional procedural details.  
11.2.1 Blood will be drawn from all participants during the 20-minute FMISO PET imaging 
sequence. Figure 1 presents the timeline for the FMISO PET imaging sequence, including 
blood sampling every 5 minutes (± 2 minutes) at 3 time points (e.g., at minutes 5, 10, and 
15 after FMISO emission scan begins).  
11.2.2 Sites are expected to process the blood samples within 60 minutes after completion of the 
PET scan.  
11.2.3 Use of dose calibrators for this procedure is strictly prohibited. 
 
 
 
ACRIN 6684 33 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  12.0 ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING 
Adverse Event (AE) reporting must follow the guidelines below. The ACRIN Adverse Event Reporting 
Manual  [November [ADDRESS_254944] revision—available on the ACRIN web site] provides 
additional details and may be consulted as a reference, but does not supersede AE reporting as specified 
in this protocol. The AdEERS electronic AE reporting system is to be used for AE reporting of AdEERS 
qualified events unless unavailable. AE data are to be entered into the AdEERS electronic system if the 
AE meets AdEERS criteria (see Section 12.8 and 12.9 for AdEERS reporting criteria), even when they 
have been manually captured and/or manually submitted due to system unavailability (see manual 
process below).  
 
12.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory or physiological finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, 
regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures 
are considered to be AEs if the abnormality: 
 
 Results in study withdrawal;  
 Is associated with a serious adverse event (SAE);  
 Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms;  
 L
eads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests;  
 Is considered by [CONTACT_1372].  
 
12.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that meets any 
one of the following criteria: 
 
 Results in death or is life-threatening at the time of the event; or  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or  
 Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in a participant‘s offspring); or  
 Requires intervention to prevent any of the above, per the investigator/sponsor.  
 
A life-threatening AE  is an AE that places the study participant, in the clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], at immediate risk of death. 
 
12.3 Adverse Event Grading 
Grade denotes the severity of the AE. An AE is graded using the current version of the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, or the following categories (if 
the term does NOT appear in the CTCAE v4.0):  
 
   1 – Mild  
 
  2 – Moderate 
 
  3 – Severe 
 
ACRIN 6684 34 Jan uary 24, 2012 
     4 – Life-threatening or disabling 
  
 5 – Fatal 
 
(F
or terms listed in the CTCAE, the grade is still recorded as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; however, the 
definition of the various grades will be specific to the term being used.)  
 
12.4 Adverse Event Attribution 
Attribution determines whether an AE is related to a study treatment or procedure. Attribution 
categories are: 
Definite  –  AE is cle arly related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
P
robable  –  AE is likely related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
P
ossible  –  AE m ay be related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
Unlikely –  AE is dou btfully related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
Unr
elated  –  AE is cle arly NOT related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
 
12.5 Expected and Unexpected Adverse Events 
AEs may be expected  or unexpected :  
 
 An expected AE  is one that is described in the protocol, the ICF, or the investigator‘s clinical 
br
ochure, even if such an event would be considered extremely rare.  
 An unexpected AE  is one that has not been described in the protocol, the ICF, or the 
investigator‘s clinical brochure. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_254945] and FMISO PET Scans   
12.6.1 Expected Adverse Events Associated With MRI 
 Anxiety/stress; 
 Claustrophobia; 
 Discomfort. 
 
Because of the powerful magnetic force of the MRI scanner, the patient may be ineligible 
to participate in the study if he or she has: 
 
 Metallic or other surgical implants (for example: pacemaker, heart valves, aneurysm 
clips, metal plates or pi[INVESTIGATOR_1325]);  
 Metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1326](s) or other body part(s); or  
 Difficulty lying still or inability to lie on your stomach.  
 
12.6.[ADDRESS_254946] Agent (Gd): 
Risks Related to Renal Dysfunction and Hemolytic Anemia 
Precautions should be exercised for participants with severely impaired renal function 
(see below) or hemolytic anemia. The very unlikely possibility of a reaction, including 
anaphylactic or cardiovascular reactions, should be considered especially for participants 
with a known sensitivity to Gd or history of asthma.  
 
 
ACRIN 6684 35 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) or Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy (NFD), 
kidney disorders, may occur in participants with moderate to end-stage kidney disease 
(glomerular filtration rate <30mL/min/1.73m2) and in participants with renal dysfunction 
due to the hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period after 
they have had a MRI scan with Gd-based MR contrast agents (GBMCA).  
 
NSF causes fibrosis of the skin and connective tissues throughout the body. Participants 
develop skin thickening that may prevent bending and extending joints, resulting in 
decreased mobility of joints. NSF usually starts in the lower extremities. Fibrosis can also 
develop in the diaphragm, muscles in the thigh and lower abdomen, and lung vessels.  
Reference: FDA/Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. May 23, 2007 
(www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/gcca/qa_200705.htm ). 
 
Other Gd-Related Risks: 
 Nausea; 
 Headache; 
 Hives; 
 Temporary low blood pressure;  
 Allergic reaction. 
 
12.6.3 Expected Adverse Events From IV Needle Placement:  
 Hemorrhage (hematoma at the injection site); 
 Infection (catheter related infection) at the injection site;  
 Minor discomfort;  
 Bleeding; 
 Bruising.  
 
12.6.4  Expected Adverse Events Associated With Radiation Risks: 
The radiation dosage for PET scanning varies with the part of the body being scanned, 
the source of the attenuation scan, the timing of the scan, the type of PET imaging being 
performed, and institution-specific radiation safety policies. The range of exposure for 
PET scanner can therefore be wide.  
For ACRIN 6684, all PET exposures for the radiopharmaceutical [18F]FMISO and all 
PET imaging will be performed for the head/brain only. Attenuation for PET correction 
can be performed using a calculated attenuation map (no radiation exposure), a 
radioisotope transmission source (PET only devices), or a CT scan (PET/CT devices). 
The following ranges have been estimated by [CONTACT_212579] a 
maximum does of 7 mCi. 
For participants who undergo two FMISO PET scans ([ADDRESS_254947] scans at baseline), the exposure for the FMISO PET examinations in this study 
are likely to range from a minimum of 7.8 mSv (780 mrem) to a maximum of 9.8 mSv 
(980 mrem) (see Table 3 below). For all other participants who have only one FMISO 
 
ACRIN 6684 36 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  PET scans, the likely dose is a minimum of 3.9 mSv (390 mrem) to a maximum of 4.9 
mSv (490 mrem).  
The
 radiation dose from the PET has not been shown to have any adverse effects. Table 3 
below describes the radiation exposure associated with each individual scan for this trial 
based on data collected in a survey of current attenuation correction practices and 
effective radiation doses conducted by [CONTACT_212580], as reported in the report, Estimation of 
Radiation Doses Due to PET Radiopharmaceuticals and to Attenuation Correction of 
PET Images , and applied to the FMISO PET scans planned for the ACRIN 6684 trial.  
For each PET scan included in ACRIN 6684, radiation dose estimates are provided fo r 
the maximum possible administered FMISO dose (7 mCi) and one of four scenarios:  
(1) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_212510]-based attenuation scan;  
(2) Maximum dose from CT-based attenuation scan from the institutional survey;  
(3) PET-only device transmission scan; and  
(4) Calculated attenuation scan (no transmission scan exposure).  
These approaches are representative of the range of technique used at ACRIN 6684 
participating sites.

Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List (CAEPR) 
for 
[18F]Fluoromisonidazole, (FMISO, NSC 742836) 
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single  
list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using  
a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a 
 subset, the Agent Specific Adverse Event List (ASAEL), appears in a separate column  
and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (ASAEL) contains events  
that are considered 'expected' for expedited reporting purposes only. Refer to the  
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm#adverse_events_adeers for further 
clarification. The CAEPR does not provide frequency data; refer to the Investigator's Brochure 
for this information. Below is the CAEPR for [18F]Fluoromisonidazole.

1This table will be updated as the toxicity profile of the agent is revised.  Updates will be 
distributed to all Principal Investigators at the time of revision.  The current version can be 
obtained by [CONTACT_13172] [EMAIL_412] .  Your name, the name [CONTACT_6823], 
the protocol, and the agent should be included in the e-mail. 
 
Note:    No adverse events have been attributed to Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) 
imaging/diagnostic administration of [18F]Fluoromisonidazole at the levels described in the 
Investigators Brochure.  Therefore, no adverse events are expected as a result of the intravenous 
(IV) administration of [18F]Fluoromisonidazole for typi[INVESTIGATOR_212511].   
 
Note:  As with many IV administered agents, [18F]Fluoromisonidazole could cause an allergic 
reaction that could potentially pose a threat to life (anaphylaxis).  This has not been observed in 
limited human exposure to date.  Reasonable precautions should be taken, consistent with normal 
radiologic and clinical facility practice.  The patient should be monitored until the PET 
 
ACRIN 6684 39 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  procedure is completed, and trained personnel and emergency equipment should be available per 
facility standards. 
  
F
or purposes of informed consent regarding reasonably foreseeable risks to subjects in 
trials utilizing [18F]Fluoromisonidazole, the following potential adverse events are 
considered extremely rare: 
 Injection-related risks that may include infection, or accidental extravasation of the 
dose that may lead to discomfort, localized pain, or infection.  
 Risks related to allergic reaction/anaphylaxis that may be life threatening. 
 
Note: As with all PET imaging agents, [18F]Fluoromisonidazole is a radiopharmaceutical that 
decays with positron emission.  As such, it poses an intrinsic radiation exposure risk.  However, 
when administered in accordance with the Investigator‘s Brochure as a PET imaging agent, this 
risk is felt to be extremely small.  The organ and total body doses associated with 
[18F]Fluoromisonidazole PET imaging are comparable to or lower than those associated with 
other widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures.   
 
Note : [18F]Fluoromisonidazole in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may 
result in events never previously associated with either agent. 
 
12.6.7 Adverse Events Related to Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy:  
ACRIN will not collect any AEs related to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Sites 
will follow institutional policies and procedures for any reported side effects for 
chemoradiation therapy. 
 
ACRIN will collect AEs that occur after 24 hours of FMISO infusion regardless of 
attribution/relatedness. Beyond this period, AEs that are determined to be definitely, 
probably, or possibly related to the participants‘ underlying disease or therapy, that are 
ALSO determined to be unrelated or unlikely related to the FMISO and procedures 
specified in this protocol, will not be reported.  Therefore, most AEs related to 
chemoradiation treatment are not expected to be reported for this trial.  
  
12.[ADDRESS_254951] access to a copy of the CTCAE v4.0. A copy of the 
CTCAE v4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/ 
reporting/ctc.html . A list of AEs that have occurred or might occur (Reported Adverse Events 
and Potential Risks) can be found in Section 6 (Pharmaceutical Information). 
 
Prompt reporting of AEs is the responsibility of each investigator, clinical research associate 
(RA), and/or nurse engaged in clinical research. Anyone uncertain about whether a particular AE 
should be reported should contact [CONTACT_212581] [PHONE_4521] for assistance. This 
study will
 be monitored by [CONTACT_212582]/CIP. 
 
All AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to 
follow-up, the condition is stabilized, or the AEs are otherwise explained. Any death or any AE 
 
ACRIN 6684 40 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  (e.g. development of cancer, congenital anomaly in conceived offspring) that is determined to be 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study agents or procedures as specified in this 
protocol—even if it occurs after a subject has discontinued study participation—must be reported 
to the 
ACRIN AE Coordinator at DMC and to all appropriate study monitors and applicable 
regulatory authorities as specified herein or as required by [CONTACT_212583]. 
 
Assignment of grades and attribution for each AE/SAE must be completed by [CONTACT_88333] [INVESTIGATOR_115655]-designee. All AEs/SAEs must be documented in the participant‘s 
study chart, AE form, and events that qualify for AdEERS must be submitted through the 
electronic-AdEERS (e-AdEERS) system in the required timeframes, as specified below. The 
ACRIN RA will capture all AEs as required herein on the AE form and in the e-AdEERS system 
where appropriate. This will ensure that they are provided to the NCI/CIP Monitor and will also 
ensure their receipt by [CONTACT_212584]. Expedited AdEERS reports must be 
entered by [CONTACT_68003]-designee. The expedited AdEERS report will be 
submitted to the lead group reviewer at ACRIN and then submitted once reviewed to the 
NCI/CIP. A copy of the report must be kept on file at the site. Significant new information on 
any on-going AE/SAE should be promptly reported to NCI/CIP and ACRIN.  
 
At each contact (site visit and/or telephone) with the study participant, the investigator or 
investigator-designee must elicit, through open ended questioning (e.g. ― How are you feeling? ‖) 
information on AEs and, if indicated, the subject should be evaluated clinically. When AEs are 
reported, concomitant medication taken by [CONTACT_212585] 2 weeks and/or during the 
time of the AE will be collected and documented. Information on all AEs that occur after 24 
hours of FMISO infusion should be recorded immediately into the source document (e.g. ACRIN 
AE L og and/or progress notes of the participant‘s study chart) and retained at the site. These AEs 
will also be recorded in the AE form. SAEs and AEs requiring expedited reporting will be 
entered into the e-AdEERS system as required, pending review by [CONTACT_212586] . 
 
All SAEs that are still ongoing at the end of the study must be followed up to determine, to the 
degree possible, the final outcome. Any SAE that occurs after the study period and is considered 
to be possibly related to the study procedures or study participation should be recorded and 
reported immediately.

Refer to the IRB policies and procedures for AE reporting.  
 
12.9.6 For automated CDUS reporting for studies using investigational agents, the DMC 
routinely reports AEs electronically to the CTEP Clinical Data Update System (CDUS 
Version 3.0). The DMC submits this data quarterly. The AEs reported through AdEERS 
will also be included with the quarterly CDUS data submissions. 
 
 
13.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(International Conference of Harmonisation [ICH] guidelines), applicable government regulations, and 
ACRIN research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval of the study conduct. The 
decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator 
and a copy of this decision will be provided to ACRIN before implementation of the study.  
 
ACRIN 6684 44 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   
The investigator will provide ACRIN with the institution‘s federal wide assurance (FWA) number, 
along with the IRB approval letter and copy of the IRB-approved ICF. The investigator will provide a 
copy(s) of IRB approval letter(s) for any amendment(s), and copy(s) of annual renewal(s). 
 
All study participants in this study will be given an IRB-approved, site-specific ICF describing the study 
and providing sufficient information for participants to make informed decisions about their 
participation in this study (see Appendix I  for an ICF template). The ICF will be submitted along with 
the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB. The study participant MUST be consented with the 
EC/IRB-approved ICF before the participant is subjected to any study procedures. The approved ICF 
MUST be signed and dated by [CONTACT_212590]-designated research staff obtaining the consent. Any revisions to the ICF at any time during 
the trial will need to be submitted to the IRB for approval and submission to ACRIN PDRC.  
 
 
14.[ADDRESS_254959] 
Any investigator and/or research staff member who has a conflict of interest with this study (such as 
patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385]) 
must fully disclose the nature of the conflict of interest in accordance with ACRIN Conflict of Interest 
policies  and applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  
 
 
15.[ADDRESS_254960] party without the consent of ACRIN, the Study Chair, and/or ACRIN Publication 
Committee. Any investigator involved in this study is obligated to provide ACRIN with complete test 
results 
and all clinical data obtained from the participants in this protocol. Investigators will follow the 
ACRIN Publication Policy (available online at www.acrin.org/PublicationsPolicy.aspx ). 
 
 
16.0 INSTITUTIONAL MONITORING AND AUDITS 
The investigator will permit study-related auditing and inspections of all study-related documents by [CONTACT_28923]/IRB, government regulatory agencies, and ACRIN. The investigator will ensure the capability for 
inspection of all participating sites‘ study-related facilities (e.g. imaging centers, satellite sites). The 
investigator will allocate adequate time for these activities, allow access to all study-related documents 
and facilities, and provide adequate space to conduct these visits.  
 
16.1 Monitoring  
Monitoring ensures data quality and the rights, safety, and well-being of the participants are 
protected. Monitoring also makes certain that the trial is in compliance with the currently 
approved protocol/amendments, with GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. It will 
provide the site an opportunity to verify that reported trial data are accurate, complete and 
verifiable from source documents. Institutional monitoring will be implemented at several 
different time points during the conduct of the study.  
 
Monitoring instructions will be sent to the site prior to the implementation of monitoring to aid in 
preparation for the review. The instructions will specify regulatory documents and participant 
 
ACRIN 6684 45 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  case records scheduled to be monitored. Case report forms (CRFs) and source documents of 
selected study participants enrolled at each site will be reviewed. In addition, the initial 
regulatory documents and any revised regulatory documents will also be monitored.  
 
16.2 Audits  
All participating institutions that enroll participants will be audited.  The timing of the initial on-
site 
audit will depend upon several factors, including the rate of accrual (both study-wide and 
site-specific), the number of evaluable participants enrolled at an individual site, the status of the 
protocol and pending amendments, and monitoring status. Generally, audits will be conducted 
after the number of evaluable participants reaches 30% of targeted accrual, either study-wide 
and/or site-specific. Audits are typi[INVESTIGATOR_212516] 3 months after an institution 
has been monitored, providing that monitoring did not identify issues that mandate immediate 
a
uditing.  This schedule may be altered in the event of pending protocol amendments. Closure of 
the study
 to accrual will trigger auditing of all participating institutions not yet audited.  
Additionally, site-specific circumstances may prompt an audit at any time. 
 
Subsequent audits will be scheduled per the outcome of the initial audit. Audits can be conducted 
more frequently at the discretion of the protocol team. The audits will be conducted per 
procedures established by [CONTACT_10077] (CIP) of the NCI. Instructions for 
preparation for the audit visit will be sent to the site prior to the scheduled audit visit. These 
instructions will specify which participant case records will be reviewed during the audit. On-site 
records will be verified against the submitted form, and the findings will be recorded on 
specially-prepared audit reports. Major discrepancies will be forwarded to the appropriate 
oversight body within ACRIN. IRB procedures, approvals, and ICFs will also be reviewed at the 
time of the audit visit. The ACRIN Audit Manual is available online at  www.acrin.org/pdrc.aspx .  
 
To help sites prepare for monitoring and audits and to assure that the investigator and the 
research staff maintain records appropriately, ACRIN Headquarters will offer training to sites. 
This training will cover all aspects of data collection, including special instructions to obtain and 
file the various source documents needed to verify the accuracy of submitted data for this trial.  
  
16.[ADDRESS_254961] verify the eligibility criteria and data submitted on all CRFs.  
 
Research records for each case should contain copi[INVESTIGATOR_212517]. If data are abstracted from medical charts that are not filed at 
the investigative sites (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]), copi[INVESTIGATOR_212518]. Every attempt must be made to obtain all records/charts that were used to abstract any 
study data for this protocol. This will prevent any discrepancies and the inability to verify the 
document and the data reported.  
 
 
 
 
ACRIN 6684 46 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  16.4  Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
CRFs, both web-based and paper forms, are the primary data collection instruments for the 
study. All data requested on the CRFs must be recorded, and any missing data must be 
explained. If a space is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not 
asked, ― N/D ‖ must be noted. If the item is not applicable to the individual case, ― N/A‖  must be 
noted. All entries must be printed legibly in black ink on the paper CRFs. In the event of any 
entry errors, corrections must be made by [CONTACT_740] a single straight line through the incorrect 
entry, writing  the initials of the person making the correction, recording the date  when the 
correction is being made, and entering the correct data above the strike through. Do not use white 
out or an eraser. Please refer to ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines . 
 
Data elements that are extracted from the medical record (source documents such as participant 
history or official clinical interpretations of images, pathology, or surgery results) and recorded 
on the CRFs will be reviewed against the appropriate component of the medical record. Data 
elements gathered from signed participant questionnaires must be available for review. Required 
study image interpretation data that are more detailed in information than the image and not 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_212519]; the CRF 
is therefore acceptable source documentation if signed by [CONTACT_737] .  
 
At the time of audit, the auditor will verify the occurrence of the imaging examination, the 
reader, and the date(s) of the exam(s) from the medical record(s). Any use of approved CRFs as 
source documentation require a signature [CONTACT_212615] a reference to the 
information source (participant questionnaire, CT, MR, etc.). Any use of CRFs as source 
documentation when the protocol has designated the source data will be medical record 
documentation will be considered a major protocol deficiency. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_254962] be sent to 
ACRIN, along with a copy of the IRB-approved, site-specific ICF. Investigator will provide a 
copy(s) of IRB approval letter(s) for any amendment(s), and copy(s) of annual renewal(s).

  17.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
17.1 Specific Aims and Analysis Plans 
17.1.1 Primary Aim 
To determine the association of baseline  FMISO PET uptake (hypoxic volume [HV], 
T/B max) and MRI parameters (Ktrans, CBV) with OS in participants with newly diagnosed 
GBM. 
 
Cox-regression model will be used to study the relationship between OS and baseline 
FMISO PET uptake (HV, T/B) and MRI parameters (Ktrans, CBV) . Uni-variate analysis 
will be carried out for each parameter individually. Any parameter that has achieved 
statistical significance ( P ≤ 0.05) will be included in the multi-variate Cox model.  
 
 
17.1.2 Secondary Aims 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Aim 1 
To determine the association of baseline  FMISO PET uptake (HV, T/B m ax) and 
MRI parameters (Ktrans, CBV) with TTP and PFS-6 in participants with newly 
diagnos
ed GBM. 
 
TTP
: Cox-regression model will be used to study the relationship between 
TTP and baseline FMISO PET uptake and MRI parameters. Uni-variate 
analysis will be carried out for each parameter individually and. Any 
parameter that has achieved statistical significance (P ≤ 0.05) will be included 
in the
 multi-variate Cox model.  
 
PFS-6: Logistic regression model will be used to study the relationship 
between PFS-6 and baseline FMISO PET uptake and MRI parameters. Uni-
variate analysis will be carried out for each parameter individually. Any 
parameter that has achieved statistical significance ( P ≤ 0.05) will be included 
in the multi-variate Logistic regression model.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Aim 2   
To assess the reproducibility  of the baseline  FMISO PET uptake parameters 
by [CONTACT_212547] “test”  and “retest” PET scans  (performed between 
1 and 7 days apart).  
 
The reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET will be quantified through 
intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) which is defined as the ratio of σ b2 and 
(σb2+ σ c2) where σ b2 is the variance of measurements between participants and 
σc2 is the variance of measurements within participants. 
 
17.1.2. 3  Aim 3 
To assess the correlation  between T/C max (tumor:cerebellum) and T/B max 
(tumor:blood) at baseline . 
 
 
ACRIN 6684 48 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman‘s rank correlation coefficient 
will be used to quantify the correlation between T/C max and T/B max.

CBV, apparent diffusion coefficient, values measured from MR spectroscopy 
such as NAA-Cho ratio, changes in BOLD signal with transient exposure to

OS: Co
x-regression model will be used to study the relationship between OS 
and other MRI parameters. Univariate analysis will be carried out for each 
parameter individually. 
 
PFS-6: Logistic regression model will be used to study the relationship 
between PFS-6 and other MRI parameters. Uni-variate analysis will be carried 
out for each parameter individually. 
 
17.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
The sample size is based on a Cox proportional hazards model testing the significance of the 
coefficient of baseline T/B max with survival time as the outcome variable and HV as a covariate. 
Using the data from Spence et al,[ADDRESS_254964] ratio is estimated to be 1.279, when R2=0.[ADDRESS_254965] deviation of T/B max is 0.765. Using PASS 2008 with a two-sided hypothesis,  
α =0.05, power of 90%, and an assumed 50% event rate, the adequate sample size is determined 
to be 46 participants. In order to accommodate a loss- to-follow up rate of 8%, we will enroll 50 
patients into the study. Should images be inevaluable, additional patients will be recruited as 
needed to obtain 50 evaluable cases; inevaluable cases will be followed and replaced. The 
participants 
will be accrued over a one-year period and will be followed up until the end of the 
study. 
 
For testing the reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET uptake parameters, 15 participants 
will undergo duplicate FMISO PET scans at baseline. With 15 participants—if the observed ICC 
is above 0.85—the half-length of 95% confidence interval (CI) will be less than 0.15.

17.3  Power Calculation 
There will be approximately 80% power to detect the significance of association between 
baseline T/B max and TTP with 50 enrolled participants and 46 evaluable participants. The 80% 
power is based on an estimate from modeling TTP with T/B max and HV as covariates (log 
hazards ratio=0.781 and R2=0.407), assuming α=0.05 and an 80% event rate.

17.4 Reporting Guidelines 
  
17.4.1 Routine reports for this protocol will be included in the ACRIN Biostatistics Center Mid-
Year and Year End Updates and will be provided to oversight bodies, including DSMC 
for review during each of its twice-yearly meeting. 
 
 Routine reports will include: 
 Accrual and participant characteristics; 
 Timeliness and completeness, eligibility and protocol compliance, and outcome 
data; 
 All re
ported adverse events. 
 
17.4.2 For automated CDUS reporting for studies using investigational agents, the ACRIN 
B
iostatistics Center (BC) will submit quarterly reports of clinical trial data per regulatory 
requirements electronically to Clinical Data Update System (CDUS Version 3.0).  The 
AEs reported through AdEERS will also be included with the quarterly CDUS data 
submissions.  
 
 
18.[ADDRESS_254966] 1 block of tumor tissue but preferably no less than 3 
blocks with accompanying representative H&E slides and pathology reports, will be obtained for 
the correlative studies of MGMT status and hypoxia/vascular markers. Blocks are strongly 
preferred.  Block tissue areas should ideally be >1cm2. For MGMT testing, the selected block 
should be composed of mostly viable tumor cells (i.e. >70%) but for the hypoxia/vascular 
markers, blocks containing viable tissue and areas of necrosis are preferred. No block will be 
completely depleted of tissue and blocks containing residual tissue will be returned to the sites. 
For a limited-size biopsy specimen and sites not approved to send blocks, a minimum of twenty 
(20) 5-m thick (section areas >1cm2), unstained sections on chemoplus/plus slides will be 
acceptable and are requested.  
A minimum of ten (10) slides for each analysis are needed for the two analyses to be performed:  
 At least 10 slides composed of mostly viable tumor cells (i.e., >70%) for MGMT testing. 
If tissue area is <1cm2, an appropriate number of additional slides are requested in order 
to obtain an amount of tissue similar to that afforded by [CONTACT_134218] (10) 5-μm thick sections at 
>1cm2. 
 
ACRIN 6684 50 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   Ten (10) additional slides are requested for immunohistochemical analyses; these 
sections should ideally contain viable tumor tissue and areas of necrosis. 
Blocks or slides, representative H&E slides, and pathology reports should be sent to:

18.1.1 Hypoxia and Vascular Markers 
To investigate the possible relationships between hypoxic markers and FMISO uptake 
with progression-free survival and overall survival, tumor tissue obtained for diagnosis of 
glioblastoma will be analyzed for expression of hypoxic and vascular markers.  No 
additional biopsy will be obtained.  In particular, HIF1-alpha, GLUT1, CAIX, CD31, and 
alpha-SMA, will be assessed using immunohistochemical staining. HIF1-alpha, GLUT1, 
and CAIX will be used to evaluate degree of hypoxia, and CD31 and alpha-SMA will be 
used to look at tumor blood vessels and pericyte coverage. 
Briefly, 5- m sections will be cut from selected blocks. The sections will be 
deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Endogenous 
peroxidase activity will be quenched with 0.5% H 2O2 in methanol for 10 min during one 
of the rehydration steps. Antigen unmasking will be performed by [CONTACT_212591], according to antigen retrieval protocols 
previously optimized for each antibody. The slides will then be allowed to cool in the 
buffer for 20 min. To block nonspecific immunobinding sites, slides will be incubated in 
10% NHS in PBS/1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature; in addition, 5% milk is 
added to the blocking step for alpha-SMA.  
Immunostaining will be performed by [CONTACT_212592] 
(monoclonal or polyclonal) for the optimized time and dilution. Each round of staining 
includes a positive control tissue as well as the positive control tissue incubated without 
primary antibody as a negative control. This also controls for round-to -round variation in 
staining so that samples can be better compared across multiple rounds of staining 
performed over time. The slides will be washed with phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) 
and then incubated for 30 min with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody in 
PBS/1%BSA; concentrations of secondary antibodies vary for each antibody according to 
previously optimized protocols. Antibody binding sites will be visualized by [CONTACT_212593]-
biotin horseradish peroxidase complex solution (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector 
Laboratories) and 3, 3‘-diaminobenzidine (DAB). After rinsing in water, the slides will 
be counterstained with Gills hematoxylin (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), dehydrated, 
and coverslipped. 
Immunostains of the biopsy specimens will be scored according to antibody-dependent 
protocols. Briefly, HIF1-alpha will be scored separately for the percentage of tumor cells 
positive for cytoplasmic (non-activated) and nuclear (activated) staining; GLUT1 and 
CAIX will be scored for the percentage of tumor cells demonstrating positive membrane 
staining; CD31 and alpha-SMA staining will be scored by [CONTACT_212594] [ADDRESS_254968] vessel density. Subsequent to detailed scoring of the 
tissues, refined scores of 0-3+ will be assigned based on appropriate antibody-dependent 
scales, as previously determined. The immunostain results will be interpreted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nutt, 
who will be blinded to the imaging results and will assign each biopsy with a composite 
score for each marker. 
 
18.1.2 MGMT Testing 
MGMT analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_212595] (EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit, Zymo Research, Orange, CA). MGMT  
methylation-specific PCR (MSP) will then be performed using PCR primer sets specific 
for methylated and unmethylated MGMT  promoter sequence.39 Presence of unique PCR 
amplification products generated by [CONTACT_941] ― methylated MGMT ‖ and ― unmethylated 
MGMT‖  primers is assessed along with appropriate bisulfite-treated methylated and 
unmethylated control genomic DNA using agarose electrophoresis.

This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Your study doctor will explain this clinical trial to you. 
Clinical trials include only participants who choose to take part. Please take your time with your 
decision to take part. You are encouraged to discuss all parts of this study with your family and friends 
and to ask your healthcare team as many questions as needed.  
 
If you want more information about participating in clinical trials, ask your study doctor for the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) booklet Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies . Also, you can learn

C
ANCER ([PHONE_1131] or TTY: [PHONE_1132]).  
 
You a
re being asked to be in this study because you have been diagnosed with a form of brain cancer 
called glioblastoma . This clinical trial involves taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_212524]. 
Two types of images will be taken at different times during your brain cancer treatment. Contrast-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used routinely to create pi[INVESTIGATOR_212525]. This study 
will also be using positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a new investigational imaging agent 
that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is studying. If you decide to volunteer for this study, you 
will be asked to sign and date this form. 
 
 
WHY  IS THIS  STUDY  BEING  DONE? 
The purpose of this study is to see if the investigational radioligand 18F-fluoromisonidazole (commonly 
known as FMISO) used during PET scans can help doctors see if a tumor is getting enough oxygen. 
Radiation and chemotherapy do not appear to work as well on tumors with low oxygen levels. 
 
This clinical trial will study brain images from PET scans using the investigational radioligand FMISO. 
A radioligand  is a molecule that carries a small amount of radioactive substance in to the body, where 
the PET scanner can pi[INVESTIGATOR_212526] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_212527]. When 
the study doctors take pi[INVESTIGATOR_212528] a PET scanner after the FMISO agent has been injected 
into the body, they hope to see how well the tumor is getting oxygen.  
 
 
ACRIN 6684 56 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  If a brain tumor is not getting enough oxygen (called hypoxia ), then the treatments that can destroy it 
might not work as well. The more doctors know about how the amount of oxygen a tumor gets effects 
treatment, the more likely they are to give a patient the right treatment from the beginning. This study 
will add to doctors‘ knowledge of how tumors, hypoxia, and treatments are related.  
 
FMISO is not approved yet by [CONTACT_212601]. This 
trial‘s results will add to the evidence available on this agent as the FDA decides whether it should be 
used regularly to help people with brain cancer. 
 
About MRI Scans With Gadolinium Contrast 
An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves linked to a computer to create cross-sectional images 
of the body, in this case of the brain, that are remarkably clear and detailed. The MRI scans taken in this 
study will help the study doctors view your brain tumor. A contrast agent called gadolinium will be used 
during your MRI scans. A contrast agent  is a liquid-like dye that goes into the body to help imaging 
machines create pi[INVESTIGATOR_212529]‘s organs and bones.  
 
About PET Scans 
PET scan is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a 3-D image of how the body functions. 
In other words, PET scans take pi[INVESTIGATOR_212530]—in this case, in the 
br
ain and, with the FMISO, how much oxygen is getting into the brain tumor. 
 
About the Radioligand FMISO  
The FMISO agent is an investigational radioligand, a molecule containing radioactive substance. The 
low dose of radiation that it gives off from inside the body is pi[INVESTIGATOR_212531]. The images 
show color where the FMISO emits radiation so study doctors can see whether oxygen is available to 
different areas of the tumor. 
 
 
HOW MANY  PEOPLE  WILL  TAKE  PART  IN THE  STUDY?  
About 50 people newly diagnosed with advanced brain cancer (glioblastoma) from 4 to 10 institutions 
will take part in this study.   
 
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY? 
You will be directly involved with this clinical trial‘s imaging procedures for the two (2) weeks after 
you are enrolled to participate, during the time before you start treatment. You may sign this consent 
form and then be unable to participate because of new information about your health; in these instances, 
you will be informed and the reason you were unable to participate will be collected. However, 
information about your cancer—including whether it gets worse—will be collected from your treating 
doc
tor(s) until the study ends, which may be up to [ADDRESS_254970] completed the imaging visits and all the 
information has been collected. This study may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_6814], ACRIN, 
FDA, or NCI without your consent should: 
 
ACRIN 6684 57 Jan uary 24, 2012 
   
 Your health or safety be at risk; 
 You not follow study instructions; 
 The study drug no longer be available; 
 New information becomes available that might change your mind about 
participating in the trial; 
 An administrative decision made by [CONTACT_39635], ACRIN, FDA, or NCI. 
 
These actions do not require your consent, but you will be informed of any of these decisions if such a 
decision is made. 
 
You can stop participating in this study at any time. However, if you want to stop participating in the 
study, we encourage you to talk to the study doctor and your treating doctor before making your final 
decision. Withdrawal will not interfere with your future care. There will be no penalty for deciding not 
to participate.  
   
 
WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO DO IN THE STUDY? 
If you agree to take part in this study and are determined to be eligible by [CONTACT_6814], you will be 
asked to read and sign this consent form before you are enrolled to participate in this trial and before any 
study procedures are performed.  When you are enrolled into the study, you will have the following tests 
and procedures. As part of this study, a sample of your tumor tissue obtained from a biopsy or surgery 
that resulted in the diagnosis of a brain tumor will be sent and stored until processed at ACRIN 
designated pathology laboratory for analysis as part of this study. You will not need to have any 
additional biopsies to participate in the study.   
 
See the Study Chart at the end of this section for a visit- by-visit outline of what will be expected of you 
if you decide to participate in this trial. 
 
Standard medical procedures that are part of regular cancer care and would probably be done 
even if you do not join the study :

                                                               Your Initials 
 
Intravenous (IV) catheters. Each visit when you have the FMISO PET scan, you will need to have two 
(2) IV catheters placed, one in a vein in your left arm, the other in a vein in your right arm. During the 
FMISO PET scan, blood samples will be taken from one of the IV catheters. The other IV catheter will 
be used to inject the radioligand FMISO for the PET scan or the gadolinium contrast for the MRI scan. 
Two (2) IV catheters will be important to ensure that the blood samples taken during the study do not 
contain any of the FMISO contrast agent.  
 
Note that if you have the MRI scan on a separate day from the FMISO PET scan, then you will need 
only one (1) IV catheter that day. You and your study and/or treating doctors should discuss the risks 
and benefits associated with two-days of scanning, as you would be exposed to additional risk from one 
more IV catheter placement for each additional imaging day throughout the study. 
 
Preparation for a PET scan. Before each FMISO PET scan, do not deliberately fast and drink lots of 
liquids. You will be given details of what to do to prepare for your PET scan prior to each imaging visit. 
 
During the PET exam. Each day of your FMISO PET scan, you first will be given an injection of a 
small amount of the radioactive drug/tracer into a vein in your arm or hand. The amount of radiation is 
small, about the same as x-ray studies like CT. The radioactive tracer only stays in your body for a few 
hours. The FMISO will travel to your brain to aid in the images created by [CONTACT_212602].  
 
During the PET scan, small amounts of blood will be collected from the IV catheter in the arm that did 
not receive the FMISO agent.  
 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254975] two hours (110 minutes) after the injection of FMISO, you will be asked to go to the 
bathroom (urinate) and then lie on a partially enclosed scanning table, face up. The table will slide into 
the machine. You will be asked to remain still during the scan. You will hear buzzing or clicking sounds 
during the scan. You will need to lie still for about [ADDRESS_254976] had 
your FMISO PET scan(s), you will receive radiation and chemotherapy (also known as chemoradiation) 
about a week after completing your first scan(s). The chemoradiation you will be getting is not a part of 
this study. It will be the usual treatment for your kind of brain cancer. You and your treating doctor will 
decide how much chemoradiation you will get.  
 
Follow up.  You will continue to see your treating doctor once the chemoradiation treatments have 
ended. You will see your treating doctor at regular intervals according to her/his recommendations and 
usual practice. Information gathered by [CONTACT_212603]-up visits will 
be given to your study doctor or research staff so they can find out more about your health. Any MRI or 
CT scans that are performed as routine care during the study period will be submitted along with your 
health status to ACRIN Headquarters in Philadelphia, PA. Your personal information will not be 
included on the images, though, to protect your privacy.  
 
Your treating doctor will be asked to inform the study doctor or research staff about your health and 
your disease status until the end of the study (up to five [5] years after you completed your treatment and 
had your last FMISO PET scan). The study doctors will want to collect follow-up images (standard of 
care MRI and CT scans) during this time. Your follow-up care will be decided between you and your 
treating doctor.

WHAT  ARE  THE  POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS  OF THE  STUDY? 
While on the study, you may be at risk for side effects. You should discuss the possible side effects 
listed below with the study doctor, research staff, and/or your treating doctor. There also may be other 
side 
effects that we cannot predict. Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and 
uncomfortable. Many side effects go away shortly after the imaging scan  is stopped and IV catheters are 
removed, but in some cases side effects can be serious, long lasting, or permanent.  
 
If you receive Ativan or another sedative, there is a small risk of a reaction to the sedative medication. 
We will not administer this drug if you have had a bad reaction to similar medications in the past or if 
your medical history suggests that you are at risk for a reaction. If you receive a sedative, you will not be 
allowed to drive yourself home. 
 
Risks Associated With an IV Injection:  
 Bruising, pain, or infection at the injection site; 
 Leaking of IV fluid into tissues near the injection; 
 Allergic reaction, which could be serious or life threatening. 
 
Risks Associated With MRI: 
 Anxiety/stress; 
 Claustrophobia; 
 Discomfort. 
 
Because of the powerful magnetic force of the MRI scanner, you may not be able to participate in the 
study if you have: 
 
 Metallic or other surgical implants (for example: pacemaker, heart valves, aneurysm clips, metal 
plates or pi[INVESTIGATOR_1325]); 
 Metal pie
ces in your eye(s) or other body part(s); or  
 Difficulty lying still or inability to lie on your stomach.  
 
Notify your doctor if any of the above relate to you. Also, carefully read the information you should 
receive at the MRI facility about other risks.  
 
While there are no significant risks from MRI, you may be uncomfortable due to the loud noise and/or 
feelings of claustrophobia during the MRI. If you experience a sensation of claustrophobia while in the 
magnet, the MRI will be immediately stopped. You will be excluded from the study if you are pregnant 
or have a pacemaker or other electromagnetic device, or have a vascular clip in your head. No serious 
biologic effects have been reported from the magnetic fields used in clinical MRI. 
 
Risks Associated With Gadolinium: 
Approximately two percent (2%) of participants experience some side effects with the use of 
gadolinium; however, they are mostly mild (nausea, headache, hives, temporary low blood pressure) . 
Serious side effects are very rare and are discussed below. Recent information has suggested that the use 
of gadolinium may contribute to kidney disease in patients with poor kidney function. Therefore, we 
 
ACRIN [ADDRESS_254979] to remove you from the study. 
 
Less likely 
 Headaches;  
 Nausea.  
 
Less likely, but serious 
 Allergic reaction. 
 
Very rare, but serious 
 Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)/Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy (NFD). NSF is a 
condition associated with the gadolinium contrast agent when there is severe kidney disease. 
Symptoms include tightening or scarring of the skin and organ failure. In some cases, it can be 
deadly. NSF has not been seen in patients with normal working kidneys or mild problems in kidney 
function. Prior to study entry, we will determine if your kidneys are working properly in order to 
help make sure the gadolinium contrast agent is safe for you. 
 
Risks Associated With PET Scans:   
 Discomfort from lying still on your back for a total of about 20 minutes for each scan ;  
 Claustrophobia
 (feeling anxious and ‗ closed in‘). 
 
Risks Associated With [18F]FMISO PET/CT: 
There are a few possible risks of [18F]FMISO  PET and PET/CT scans. The most common ones are not 
considered serious. Any serious risks of [18F]FMISO PET or PET/CT scans are considered very 
unlikely. All of the known risks are described below. 
 
Radiation Risk 
<<Each site may need to modify this section to quote the correct PET and CT dosimetry for its own 
PET/CT and PET-only scanners in accordance with its own institutional policies and procedures. The 
following language and dosing range is an example only.>> 
FOR EXAMPLE: 
There are some risks from the PET scans used to monitor your tumor status and your response to 
treatment. These scans will expose you to radiation. If you live in the US, you receive about 300 
millirem of radiation each year. It comes from space and the earth around you. This is called 
― background ra diation.‖ A ― millirem ‖ (mrem) is a unit used to measure doses of radiation. The radiation 
dose to your whole body from each of your PET scans will range from [ADDRESS_254980] two total study-related FMISO PET scans ([ADDRESS_254981] two FMISO baseline 
scans). For participants who undergo one total study-related FMISO PET scans, the likely doses will 
range from [ADDRESS_254982] the investigators (contact [CONTACT_212605]). 
 
Reproductive Risk   
If you are pregnant or nursing or plan to become pregnant leading up to the imaging component of the 
study, you cannot take part in this research study. We do not know the effects of the FMISO agent on 
the fetus, breastfeeding baby, or mother- to-be, and this study may cause harm. Because the PET and 
MRI scans and the investigational radioligand FMISO in this study can affect an unborn or nursing 
baby, you should not become pregnant or breastfeed, or father a baby, while undergoing imaging with 
FMISO for this study.  
 
You and your study doctor should discuss taking precautions. If you or your partner does become 
pregnant, you will need to tell your study doctor immediately. If you are unsure of your pregnancy status 
on the day of your imaging scans for the trial, you will need to tell your study doctor and have a 
pregnancy test before any of the day‘s study procedures. 
 
Ask about counseling and more information about preventing pregnancy.  
 
 
WHAT ARE  THE  POSSIBLE  BENEFITS  OF TAKING  PART  IN THE  STUDY? 
You will not receive any direct benefit from participation in this research study. We hope the 
information learned from this study will benefit other patients with brain cancer in the future. Doctors 
may be able to use the information from this study to help them determine the best treatment approaches 
for people with certain types of brain cancer or help treatments work better in brain cancers that are 
difficult to treat. 
 
 
WHAT  OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE? 
You may choose to not participate in this study. You could have PET and MRI scans done without 
participating in this study. If you decide not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to 
which you are otherwise entitled. Please talk with your treating doctor about this and other options.

WELL COUNTER CROSS-CALIBRATION PROCEDURE 
 
NOTE:   As a pre-qualification measure, sites will need to demonstrate appropriate well counter 
c
ross ca
libration.   
1. The  time of all measurements should be documented in reference to a single clock.  If possible, 
the clocks on the PET scanner, well counter, and dose calibrator (if it has a clock) should be 
synchronized to this reference clock. 
2. F ill a uniform cylindrical phantom (18-22 cm diameter) with water and eliminate as many air 
bubbles as possible. 
3. F ill a syringe with a sufficient activity of 18F to achieve a concentration in the phantom of 
approximately 0.2 uCi/mL.  Make sure the syringe is properly placed inside the dose calibrator.  
Assay the syringe activity in the dose calibrator and record the assay result in mCi and the assay 
time.  
4. W ithdraw approximately [ADDRESS_254985] the assay result and assay 
time, seal the phantom and repeatedly invert to mix the solutions. Enter the measured full syringe 
activity (mCi), measured full syringe activity assay time, residual syringe activity (mCi), residual 
syringe activity assay time, and volume of the completely filled phantom (mL) in the EXCEL 
spreadsheet. 
6. Add water to the phantom to fill it completely.  Re-seal and thoroughly mix the contents of the 
phantom, to make sure that the 18F is uniformly distributed. 
7. Using  a calibrated balance (with at least 1 mg precision), weigh each of the three (labeled 1,2,3) 
gamma tubes with their respective caps, and enter the weight of each gamma tube (including 
cap) separately in the EXCEL spreadsheet. 
8. W ithdraw three 1.[ADDRESS_254986] 1.0 mL of tap water into a gamma counting tube labeled ― BKG ‖ 
for measuring background radiation. 
 
ACRIN 6684 69 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  13. Count each of the samples and the BKG tube in the well counter for 60 seconds using a counting 
window set for 511 keV photons, or close equivalent.  Enter the counting results and start times 
of the counting of each sample into the EXCEL spreadsheet 
14. The  formulas in the spreadsheet will combine the weight of the samples and the number of 
counts per minute and display the well counter rate concentration, R (wc) (cpm/mL), decay 
corrected back to the start time of the PET scan.  The cpm/mL is calculated by [CONTACT_212608], assuming a density of 1 g/mL. 
15. Upon completion of the image reconstruction measure the mean SUV (based on weight) by 
[CONTACT_212609] a large circular ROI with a diameter that is at least [ADDRESS_254987] and then copying that ROI, to all planes 
(EXCEPT THE FIRST AND LAST PLANE). Average the mean SUV‘s for all the ROI‘s 
throughout the phantom as measured by [CONTACT_212602]. 
16. Using  the EXCEL spreadsheet provided, enter the data from the procedure above to compute the 
cross-calibration factor. 
17. The  calibration factor (CF) between the well counter (wc) and the Dose Calibrator (dc), and the 
calibration factor between the PET scanner and the DOSE Calibrator is calculated as follows: 
 
CFwc = R ( wc)/R(wc) 
CFPET = R ( dc)/PET 
 
Note:  The units of CF are uCi/CPM, which is used by [CONTACT_212610]/mL.  The units of CF PET are (uCi/mL)/SUV.  The ACRIN Core PET Lab 
will
 complete the calculations when processing FMISO image and blood data.

BLOOD SAMPLING PROCEDURES 
 
 
NOTE:   As a pre-qualification measure, sites will need to demonstrate appropriate well counter 
c
ross calibration. Use of dose calibrators for this procedure is strictly prohibited as the dose 
calibrator is not sensitive enough for the following measurements. 
 
1. F ind a single global clock that can be used to record each count time.  Synchronize all clocks to 
the PET scanner time prior to performing the procedures, especially the well-counter clock and 
the clock used to measure blood draw times. 
2. The  well counter being used should have a CF calibration within one week prior to the study.  
The value and the date of calibration must be entered on the appropriate data submittal form. 
3. Thr ee venous blood samples are obtained at intervals of five minutes (± two minutes) at 5, 10, 
and [ADDRESS_254988] be drawn from the IV placed in the opposite arm, which was not used 
for the FMISO injection. 
5. To a void dilution, 3 –  [ADDRESS_254989] be drawn for ― was te‖ prior to each of the blood samples drawn. 
6. To ensure adequate volume to pi[INVESTIGATOR_212534], 3 – [ADDRESS_254990] be recorded on the appropriate form.

Attachment A to Protocol ACRIN 6684 
Report: Radiation Dose Estimates for PET and PET/CT 
 
ACRIN 6684 72 Jan uary 24, 2012 
  Estimation of Radiation Doses Due To PET Radiopharmaceuticals  
and to Attenuation Correction of Pet Images 
 
There are multiple reasons that contribute to the various radiation doses reported with PET and PET/CT 
scanning. They can be attributed to: 
 
1. Source of Attenuation Correction: The radiation dose due to attenuation correction varies widely based on 
the attenuation correction method used. This can be a low dose cesium or germanium source, a low dose 
or higher dose non-diagnostic CT scanner, a diagnostic CT scanner.  The method of attenuation correction 
can be a major source of radiation dose variation. The CT scanner characteristics and recommended 
settings vary considerably between manufacturers and different centers use different scanning settings to 
meet the needs for their studies. 
 
2. The PET tracer being evaluated: Different PET tracers have varying biodistribution as well as varying 
levels of uptake in areas of interest – such as a tumor. The tracer uptake can vary not only across 
hist
ologies (different tumor types) but also in different grades of the same histology. Most of the studies 
that the NCI is performing are to define these attributes for PET tracers of interest in the relevant 
histologies, so different studies may require different doses of the same radiopharmaceutical in order to 
provide evaluable quantitative or qualitative output. 
 
3. The timing of the scan: Given that these PET tracers have fairly short half lives, the dose of the PET 
tracer may vary depending on when the scan is performed relative to the injection to deliver information 
of biological relevance. The longer the time between injection and scanning, the larger the dose that needs 
to be administered. 
 
4. The area of the body being evaluated: Depending on the biodistribution, metabolic and the excretory 
pathways for a PET tracer, different amounts of the PET tracer may need to be injected in order to obtain 
an image with sufficient signal for accurate image interpretation in different body areas. In addition, the 
amount of attenuation changes based on the body part being imaged – and the dose is varied accordingly 
– for example, a brain PET can be performed with a smaller dose than a body PET T due to less 
at
tenuation and a more limited imaging field. 
 
5. The type of PET imaging being performed:  Some studies require dynamic scans to determine tracer 
kinetics, while other measures only static tracer uptake across a larger area of the body.  Different 
radiopharmaceutical doses may be needed for these different types of studies depending upon tracer 
kinetics, area of the body imaged, and quantitative imaging requirements 
 
6. Institution radiation safety policies:  Different radiation-safety committees and IRBs have different 
approaches to estimating and communicating total radiation dose.  A given institution may have 
standardized values that they use for all PET scans or may demand protocol and instrument specific dose 
evaluation.  They may then communicate the maximum dose possible or the likely dose or the range.  In 
all cases each institution‘s radiation safety committee and IRB have the ultimate responsibility to 
communicate the exposure in the informed consent to their patients.

performed, both in routine clinical practice and in research studies. Table 1  sho ws the reported effective 
dose (ED) from the radioactive isotope for the various radiopharmaceuticals that are being studied under 
IND by [CONTACT_212611], along with FDG for comparison.  Since these are empi[INVESTIGATOR_212535], other estimates may not be identical to these, but will be 
similar.  The exposure from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 10 mCi dose is also given, but note that the dose for these 
radiopharmaceuticals can vary.  FDG for example, is labeled for 8-12 mCi, but some clinicians give 
substantially higher doses.

*The ED was calculated from the individual organ doses (from published data), multiplying each by [CONTACT_212612] (as per ICRP60 and ICRP80) and summing the results to get the ED. 
 
Attenuation correction is usually performed for research scans and can be performed three ways: 
 Rotating rods of Ge-68 or point sources of Cs-137 
 Low dose, non-diagnostic CT 
 Diagnostic CT 
 
The CT methods can have a range of radiation doses depending on scanner type and setting. 
Furthermore, the overall scan can be performed for three different imaging regions, which affects the 
effective dose from the transmission scan, depending upon the extent of the body that is imaged: 
 Torso Survey (oropharynx to mid-thigh) 
 Single Axial Field of View  
  Head Only 
 
The
 non-diagnostic CT provides both attenuation correction and anatomic correlation, so that the lesions 
identified in the PET scan can be localized anatomically with greater resolution than provided by a PET 
scan with gamma-ray source attenuation.  In practice, the non-diagnostic CT has mostly replaced the use

ACRIN [ADDRESS_254992] scans, regardless of classification as diagnostic or non-diagnostic, are not 
necessarily identical at different institution or with different scanners even at the same institution.  These 
four factors – the specific radiopharmaceutical, type of attenuation correction, institution 
inst
rumentation/practices and anatomic coverage – lead to a large range of effective doses being 
re
ported for a given PET radiopharmaceutical scan.   
 
With the assistance of David Mankoff, MD, PhD, University of Washington, Seattle, a survey was done 
of the current attenuation correction practices and effective radiation doses for five major cancer centers 
experienced in PET/CT.  The sites provided the CT settings they typi[INVESTIGATOR_212536].  Radiation dose was calculated using ImPACT9.  This program is 
a tool for calculating patient organ and effective doses from CT scanner examinations.  It makes use of 
the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) Monte Carlo dose data sets produced in report 
SR250 from the [LOCATION_006] Health Protection Agency.   SR250 provides normalized organ dose data for 
irradiation of a mathematical phantom by a variety of CT scanners.  A summary of the survey results is 
shown in Table [ADDRESS_254993] these data to be 
representative of good practices at centers likely to perform phase 2 trials with investigational imaging 
agents.

ACRIN [ADDRESS_254997] standardized values that they use for all PET scans 
or may utilize protocol and instrument specific dose evaluation.  They may then communicate the 
maximum dose possible or the likely dose.  In all cases each institution‘s radiation safety committee and 
IRB have the ultimate responsibility to communicate the exposure in the informed consent to their 
patients. 
 
As a result, in a specific protocol, we can include our best estimates in the trial protocol and also include 
them in a draft informed consent form, but institutions can, and should, modify these in accordance with 
their local policies and practices.

Objectives:   
● To prove that total knee arthroplasty can be performed with little, if any need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_403930] a combination of education, optimized pre -op and post -op pain protocols, and 
optimized recovery protocols.   
● The secondary  objective is to show that nearly al l patients can be treated as outpatient 
joint replacements   
 
Study Group:   
All total knee arthroplasties   
Comparison Group:   
Cohort study: Start with 2 - 3 months of patient enrollmen ts (approximately 40 TKR/month). This 
could be baseline. In a years’ time that would equal approximately [ADDRESS_509300] - 
total knee replacement surgery that deals with patient’s  surgical pain. This is in part due to the 
unknown actual number of tablets taken post -op for surgical pai n versus other comorbidities in 
these patients. Most studies are based on actual refills of opi[INVESTIGATOR_403931]. There has been other studies to examine post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_403932], predictors 
and use following total joint arthroplas ty:

Predictors of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_403934]:  
Prospective, consecutive case series with h istorical matched control group  
• All study patients will receive a standardized protocol   
● All surgical procedures performed by a single surgeon using the same implants, same 
approach, same pre -op and post -op optimization, and same simplified pain protocol at a 
single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403935]   
          ● Researchers will attempt to minimize the nu mber of anesthesiologists  to further      
control  variability  in care  
  
Research  Team:   
● Andrew Wickline, M.D., Principal Investigator, Surgeon – will review data weekly to 
ensure quality data collection   
● PA’s -Dennis Golis, Chuck Stefan, Anne Moore   
● Full -time research associate Rph Mary Ann Stevenson – responsible for data collection   
Methods  
1. Data Collection   
● EMR chart review (historical control)   
● Pre -op assessment   
● Post -op assessment – PACU, Phase II (prior to discharge)   
● Phone calls after discharge   
● Follow -up assessment in surgeon’s office   
● SwiftPath®   
● KOOS, JR   
2. Pre -op Optimization   
● All patients enroll in SwiftPath® education program   
● All patients have optimized BMI, hemoglobin, albumin, glucose control – A1C, and blood 
pressure control   
3. Total Joint Procedure:   
● Tourniquet -free cemented TKA  performed with intra -articular block   
4. Pain Managemen t Regimen  for TKA:   
● Pre -op patient  educ ation  regimen , which includes pre -op physical therapy 
teaching   
● Post -op multimodal pain management regimen: Oxycodone 5mg every 4 to 6 
hours  or Tramadol 50mg every 4 -6 hours, Acetaminophen 1000 mg three times a 
day, Celebrex 100mg twice a day, or Mobic 7 .5mg twice a day , and c ryotherapy  
(ice therapy)   
● All patients have u/s guided adductor canal block with catheter   
● Patients receive ON -Q adjustable pain ball in the recovery room starting at 4 ml/hr  and 
are discharged when criteria the following criteria is met: ability to ambulate, can  tolerate 
food/fluids, controlled nausea/vomiting, ability to empty bladder, vital signs within pre -op 
values, ability to pass physical therapy assessment for daily li ving skills   
● Anesthesiologist regimen: adductor canal block with 20 ml ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] 0.2% followed by 
[CONTACT_403936], a continuous infusion via pain ball containing ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] 0.2% at  
starting rate of 4ml/hour in post - acute care unit (PACU) . Patient given instructions on how 
to self - adjust infusion rate before discharge. Patient has  the ability to titrate dose after 
discharge with duration lasting 3 to 5 days.   
 
5. Inclusion Criteria:   
● Partial and total knee arthroplasty   
● Unilateral only   
● Patie nt surgeries scheduled to be performed at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395618]   
● Patients must enroll in SwiftPath®   
● Ability to read and understand English   
● Primary care clearance for patients diagnosed with high/low blood pressures   
6. Exclusion Criteria:   
● Disease states, patient conditions to exclude -schizophrenia, bipolar disease, dementia   
● Known allergies to local anesthetics   
● Contraindications for regional analgesia

● Previous fracture to affected extremity   
● BMI >40   
● Hemoglobin <12 female, <13 male   
● Albumin less than 3.5   
● A1C >8.0   
Outcomes

● Pre -op opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]  
● Peri -op opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]  
 
 2. Secondary Outcomes:

● Sleep quality   
● Adherence to prescribed post -op recovery protocol   
● ROM   
● Adverse events   
● Serious side effects   
● Length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (surgery to discharge)    
● KOOS, JR and Swiftpath

3. Data collection   
●Intervals: PACU, DOS, POD 1, 2, 3, 10-14, 3week, 6week, 12weeks   
● SwiftPath ; A program that emphasizes patient/family engagement and 
education, using MIS techniques, reduction in narcotic use, utilization of 
modern pain management and early mobilization    
● KOOS JR:This is a survey that is an assessment and questionnaire that 
rates a patient joint pain, stiffness and function in daily living.

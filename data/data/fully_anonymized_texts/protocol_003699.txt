Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488619] cancer in the [LOCATION_002] each 
year (Jemal et al ., 2010). An additional 52,000 are  diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in 
situ (D CIS) (American Cancer Society statistics). Of women newly diagnosed with breast 
cancer, studies h ave reported that between 14 and 51 percent will undergo preoperative 
MRI  (Arrington et al ., 2009; Jones et al ., 2009; Sorbero et al ., 2009; Wood, 2009). In an 
era of  increasing breast MRI usage and improved  radiographic  imaging modalities , the 
incidence o f preoperatively identified multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancers (MIBC) 
including multicentric (MC) and/or multifocal (MF) breast cancer is increasing  
(Bendifallah et al ., 2010; Berg and Gilbreath, 2000; Berg et al ., 2011; Houssami et al., 
2008; Moon et al., 2002; Wilkinson et al. , 2005). Data show that MRI is more accurate 
than mammography alone in detection of MIBC. A meta -analysis performed in 2008 
demonstrated that MRI identified additional tumor foci in 16  % of newly diagnosed 
breast cancer patients (Houssami et al., 2008).  Increased utilization of bilateral whole 
breast sonography in women with a new breast cancer diagnosis has also led to increasing 
detection of MIBC (Wilkinson et al ., 2005). Other novel imaging modalities, for example 
positive emission mammography  (PEM), breast specific gamma imaging (BSGI) and 
Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI), may continue to increase the detection of MIBC. A PEM/MRI study reported 14 % of patients enrolled were converted to mastectomy based 
on findings from these novel images (Berg and Gilbreath, 2000).  
 The prevalence of MIBC ranges across studies from 13  to 75 % but the true incidence is 
difficult to ascertain given the varying definitions of multifocal and multicentric used 
between studies (Bendifallah et al ., 2010).
  Classically, multifocal disease is defined as 
two or more foci of disease within the same quadrant of the breast and multicentric 
disease as two or more foci of disease in different quadrants of the breast. Differentiating between multifocal and multicentric tumors by [CONTACT_389903]. A tumor at 11 o’clock can be [ADDRESS_488620] from a tumor at the 1 o’clock position and these would be classified as multicentric , 
whereas 2 tumors both a t the 2 o’clock position that are [ADDRESS_488621] confirmed that the rate of mastectomy is increasing in the [LOCATION_002] 
(Katipamula et al ., 2009; McGuire et al., 2009). This may be linked to several factors 
including use of pre-operative MRI and of the resulting increase in detection of MIBC 
(Bedrosian et al ., 2003; Bleicher et al ., 2009; Fischer et al., 1999; Lee et al ., 2004; 
Morrow and Harris, 209; Touttle et al., 2007). Based on historic, retrospective studies 
from the la te 1980s and early 1990s (Kurtz et al ., 1990; Leopold et al ., 1989; Wilson et 
al., 1993), most surgeons are reluctant to proceed with breast conservation therapy (BCT) 
for women with multicentric or multifocal  breast cancer due to a perceived high risk of 
local recurrence (LR). However, no scientific evidence exists to support this increased 
mastectomy rate in MIBC patients (Fisher, 2011). The emotional impact of mastectomy 
on body image and quality of life is well documented (Fung et al ., 2001; Kiebert et al ., 
Z11102 
9 
Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #08  1991); Zhao et al., 2003). The emotional benefit of breast conservation has driven 
surgeons in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe to recommend breast conservation to over 50 % 
of women with a single, early stage malignant focus for three decades (Hershman et al ., 
2009; Komenaka et al., 2010) . BCT is associated with improved patient satisfaction and 
quality of life and has been shown to be cost effective  (Al-Ghazal et al., 2000; Barlow et 
al., 2001; Norum et al ., 1997)   
 
Retrospective studies from the 1980s and early 1990s demonstrated an increased risk of 
local regional recurrence in women with two or more synchronous lesions in the breast in 
comparison to women with unifocal cancers treated with breast conservation. However, 
imaging was less advanced and the margins in the older trial were assessed grossly rather than microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  (Cho et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2003; Kurtz et al ., 1990; Leopold et 
al., 1989; Wilson et al ., 1993) 
 
In contrast, none of the retrospective studies published since [ADDRESS_488622] reported a 
significant increase in  local recurrence rates in women with multicentric/multifocal breast 
cancer who have been treated with BCT  (see Table 1 .1) (Cho et al., 2002; Gentilini et al ., 
Hartsell et al ., Kaplan et al ., 2003; Lim et al ., 2009). Multiple, recent retrospective 
studies support the safety of breast conservation in women with MIBC and confirm a rate 
of recurrence that is comparable to rates observed in women with unifocal disease 
(Bauman et al ., 2010; Cho et al., 2002; Gentilini et al., 2009; Hartsell et al., 1994). The 
largest of these contemporary trials, by [CONTACT_389904] ., reviewed 476 patients with 
multicentric  (12 %) and multifocal (88 %) invasive breast cancer treated betwee n [ADDRESS_488623]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_389873] (55 % of all patients), the local recurrence rate in this trial was 5.1  % at 5 
years (Gentilini et al., 2009).  In this study, 98.3 % of the patients received adjuvant 
systemic therapy  with 12.6 % receiving adjuvant chemotherapy alone , 40.1 % hormonal 
therapy alone,  and 45.6 % both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Adjuvant whole 
breast radiation was delivered to 95 %.   Also of interest, a retrospective study of women 
with MIBC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has documented 5 year locoregional failure rates of 7  % in patients with MIBC  (Oh et al ., 2006)

MIBC today includes patients with 2 small foci of disease detected on screening digital mammogram and/or  MRI compared to decades ago when MIBC often referred to a 
palpable mass. Introductio n of routine screening mammography and increased patient 
awareness has led to identification of breast cancer when tumors are smaller in size and 
early stage breast cancer  has better survival compared to more advanced disease. 
Therefore, more MIBC patients today  are eligible for BCT at time of diagnosis due to the 
smaller tumor size and disease burden, as compared to the 1980s and 1990s when  most 
women with MIBC presented with larger, palpable tumors. Moreover, i n women with 
newly diagnosed breast cancer who undergo MRI for surgical planning, additional 
malignant lesions which alter the surgical plan ( multicentric/multifocal lesions)  are 
detected in 8 to 27 % of patients.  This makes it important for us to reassess the 
indications for BCT versus mastectomy in women with MIBC in [ADDRESS_488624] Cancer Conference (EBCC) has recommended standard 
preoperative breast MRI in all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer given the 
significant number of additional multicentric/multifocal cancers identified using this 
modality ([ADDRESS_488625] Cancer Conference, [LOCATION_010], 15- 19 April 2008). 
In the [LOCATION_002], the role of preoperative breast MRI remains more contr oversial and 
as such it is difficult,  therefore, to determine how many centers are utilizing routine 
preoperative MRI. Using a conservative rough estimate of 30% of breast centers utilizing

Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488626] MRI (the average of 14 to 51  % documented in the literature  (Arrington et 
al., 2009; Sorbero et al ., 2009)  we would expect over 55,[ADDRESS_488627] MRI for surgical planning. Currently, meta- analysis suggests a 16  % 
incidence of identification of a second primary in the ipsilateral breast following a cancer 
diagnosis with further work- up after detection of the initial tumor  (Houssami et al., 
2008). Given the  older  retrospective case studies in the literature, the majority of 
surgeons continue to recommend mastectomy for women with multicentric  breast cancer 
and many with multifocal  breast cancer. Based on estimates above, over 17,[ADDRESS_488628] cancer 
population. Discussion with American College of Surgeons Oncology Group 
(ACOSOG) breast investigators, patient advocates and the Breast Oncology 
Local Disease (BOLD) taskforce have all indicated that a randomized trial design would not be well supported by [CONTACT_389906]. Both patient and surgeon 
bias would negatively  impact timely patient accrual. Therefore, a prospective 
single arm Phase II trial  to address the incidence of local recurrence in women 
undergoing breast conservation surgery and radiation therapy for MIBC  is 
proposed. 
 
1.22 Prognosis 
Controversy exists surrounding the pr ognosis and treatment of MIBC. No 
prospective trial has addressed this issue. Limited retrospective data debunk the 
notion that MIBC is an independent risk factor for worsened overall survival 
(Bendifallah et al ., 2010; Pederson et al ., 2004). A study by [CONTACT_389907] . reviewed 
[ADDRESS_488629] for  inferior outcome  (Oh et al ., 2006).

understanding of these concepts may lead to novel diagnostic, therape utic and

12 
Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488631] cancers are heterogeneous, both in their pathology and in their molecular 
profiles (Hwang -Verslues et al ., 2009; Shipi[INVESTIGATOR_389874] ., 2007)  This heterogeneity 
may be the result of cancer stem cells/progenitor cells which are capable of differentiation along divergent pathways (Nakshatri et al ., 2009) Heterogeneity 
exists both within and between breast cancers. The intrinsic heterogeneity in the 
MIBC population provides an in vivo  platform to better understand the variation 
within individual tumors in a given patient but more importantly, between [ADDRESS_488632] increased understanding of cancer tumor cells and tumor heterogenicity. For women with more than one tumor, understanding 
whether these tumor s are the same or different is important to guide therapy and 
the correlative science section of this study (see Section 14.0) will evaluate the similarities and differences of multiple foci of disease within the breast.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_488633] Cosmesis (Winchester and Cox, 1992) 
A single item question will be administered asking both the patient and her surgeon to assess the overall cosmetic result (excellent, good, fair, 
and poor) (Olivotto et al., 1989; Winchester and Cox, 1992). This 
questionnaire is also being used in the  trial NSABP B -39. Olivotto et al . 
also used this single item questionnaire to assess technical factors impacting whether a patient considered the cosmesis a failure following 
BCT . In g eneral, patients with a fair or poor score are considered to be a 
cosmetic “failure”.  Olivotto et al . demonstrated that cosmetic scores for 
patients classified as excellent or good cosmetic score remained consistent after 3, 5, and 7 years in 88 %, 90%, a nd 78  % of the patients, 
respectively.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_488634] -Q  
The BREAST-Q , a patient -reported outcome ( PRO) instrument for 
breast surgery patients, was recently developed to address the lack of 
instruments to measure outcome in the breast surgical population (Pusic 
et al., 2009) . The questionnaire was developed with strict adherence to 
guidelines recommended by [CONTACT_389908] 
(Lohr, 2002; USDHHS, FDA, CDER, CBER and CDRH (2009). This 
process included development of a conceptual framework, item 
generation, scale formation with item reduction, and psychometric 
evaluation. At present, the BREAST -Q contains three modules ( post 
mastectomy  reconstruction, breast reduction and breast augmentation), 
each with a preoperative and postoperative version. Each module 
includes six independent scales (satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction 
with overall outcome, psychosocial well- being, sexual well -being, 
physical well -bein g and satisfaction with care). P sychometric evaluation 
Z11102

Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #08  suggests that it exceeds criteria for rigorous measurement as established 
by [CONTACT_389909]. More specifically, e ach scale fulfilled both Rasch and 
traditional psychometric criteria (including person separation index 0.76 
to 0.95; Cronbach's alpha 0.81 to 0.96; and test- retest reproducibility 
0.73 to 0.96). The Breast Q was developed using patient interviews, focus groups, expert panels, and a literature r eview to develop a 
conceptual framework and a list of questionnaire items.  
 
Current efforts are now underway to develop a fourth module of the 
BREAST -Q (the ‘Breast -conserving therapy (BCT)’ module) to 
specifically evaluate quality of life in breast cance r patients who undergo 
BCT. The addition of this new module will allow meaningful 
comparisons of groups of patients who elect to undergo BCT, 
mastectomy , or mastectomy with reconstruction.  Preliminary versions of 
the scale have been developed from three sources: review of the 
literature; qualitative interviews with patients; and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Semi-
structured, open -ended interviews (n = 30) were recorded, transcribed 
and analyzed for content. Standard qualitative techniques were then used to identify key doma ins or themes that emerge. Questionnaire items were 
developed to reflect these domains and were phrased to reflect 
terminology and statements typi[INVESTIGATOR_389875]. The preliminary 
measure was then pre- tested in a small sample of patients (n  = 20) to 
clarify ambiguities in the wording of items, and determine acceptability and completion time  (personal communication).  
 
Field -testing of this prelimi nary instrument is now underway (personal 
communication).
 Using Rasch analysis, seven measurement criteria will 
be examined as follows: clinical meaning, thresholds for item response options, item fit statistics, item locations, differential item functioning, 
correlations between standardized residuals, and person separation index. 
The aim will be for each scale to consist of a set of clinically meaningful 
items that satisf y requirements for measurement. This goal will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_43435] a set of items hypothesized to constitute a scale for 
each area, analyzing the observed data against  measurement criteria and 
making decisions on item selection or deletion. Following item reduction, confirmatory tests on the resultant questionnaire will be 
performed using traditional psychometric methods in order to enable comparison with existing breas t scales and meet regulatory requirements.  
To this end, five measurement properties will be examined: data quality, tests of scaling assumptions, acceptability, reliability, and 
responsiveness.  
 
In this study, we will use the independent scales for satisf action with 
breasts and satisfaction with overall outcome from the Breast Q  BCT 
module. Although the final version of the BCT module is still being 
finalized, the individual questions will not change and no questions will 
be added, therefore using these questions will enable calculation of a 
score once the Breast Q  BCT scoring is complete.

Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488636]/axillary surgery , but can also occur in the breast after 
surgery. W e have previously evaluated clinical and surgical factors 
associated with the  development of postoperative breast lymphed ema 
(BLE ); yet, BLE diagnosis is currently non-standardized and is based on 
clinical impression.   
 
Previously, we prospectively evaluated patients undergoing non-
mastectomy procedures for signs and symptoms of lymphedema in the 
operated breast. BLE diagnosis was based on a graded physical exam 
targeting clinical signs of diffuse skin edema, erythema, and their location. Diagnosis was independent of patient reported symptoms. 
Additionally, patients  also rated symptoms in their operated breast for  
heaviness, discomf ort, redness, visible swelling and associated degree of 
distress using a 10 -point scale (“not at all ” = 0 to “a lot” = 10). In 
subjects with clinical BLE, s kin edema and breast erythema were 
observed in 26/26 (100 %) and 13/26 (50 %), respectively, compare d to 
5/38 (13 %) and 4/38 (11 %) without clinical BLE, respectively. BLE 
was observed in more than one quadrant  for the majority of patients  with 
BLE  (skin edema 18/26 = 69  %, and erythema 10/13 = 77 %).  
Additionally, BLE patients had significantly higher scores for breast 
heaviness, discomfort, redness, and swelling and d istress associated with 
these symptoms was significantly elevated only for symptoms of breast 
heaviness (mean 3.4 vs. 1.0, p = 0.01) and discomfort (mean 2.9 vs. 1.4, 
p = 0.03). 
 
Patients undergoing lumpectomy for MIBC and breast radiation with 
boost to both tumor beds are hypothetically a t increased risk of BLE. We 
will evaluate the incidence of BLE and symptoms as diagnosed using 
clinical examination along with  the same questionnaire used in the 
previous study to see if BLE is more common in women treated with 
BCT for MIBC than reported in our previous BLE study evaluating 
patients undergoing lumpectomy and radiation for unifocal breast cancer. 
 
1.25 Linear Analogue Self -Assessmen t (LASA)  
Both fatigue and overall perception of quality of life will be assessed using LASA. Evidence has arisen indicating that baseline single- item assessments of 
fatigue and overall quality of life are strong prognostic indicators for survival in cancer  patients, independent of performance status  (Sloan et al ., 2009;  Tan et al., 
2008).

IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this 
protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory 
Office before they can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site  registration status in 
the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of 
whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to the following:  
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number 
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization 
• A valid IRB approval 
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements.

10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_488704] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. The CTCAE is available 
at All reactions 
determined to be “reportable” in an expedited manner must be reported using the Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP- AERS), accessed 
via the CTEP website, Attribution to protocol 
treatment for each adverse event must be determined by [CONTACT_389931]. Please refer the NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for further details on AE reporting procedures. CTEP- AERS reports 
should be submitted electronically. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_488705] be reported 
in an expedited manner for timelier  monitoring of patient safety an d care. 
Following sections provide information about expedited reporting.

Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488706], identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE v e rsion 4.0.  
Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see 
Section 10.3). With this information, determine whether the event must be 
reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.4). Important:  Expedited adverse 
event reporting requires submission of a C TEP Adverse Event Reporting System 
(CTEP- AERS ) report(s). Expedited reports are to be completed using CTCAE 
version 5.0, within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Section 
10.[ADDRESS_488707] also be reported 
via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.4 and 18.0).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_488708] Level Term (LLT).  Grade is an essential element of the Guidelines and, in general, r elates to severity  for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI . 
  
NOTE:   A  severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT  the same 
as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
 
10.2
 Expected vs. Unexpected  
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on the treatment -
specific information provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol. 
 
• Unexpected AE s are those not listed in the treatment -specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is 
neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk i n the information 
provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite – The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible – The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely – The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated – The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a 
medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relation ship 
between the treatment and the adverse event.  
 
10.31 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting  
Z11102 
42 
Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488709] still be reported via routine reporting a s specified in 
Section 10.5.  The protocol -specific guidelines supersede the NCI Adverse Event 
Reporting Guidelines (See Section 10.4) for AE reporting. 
 
10.32 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
Any AE that results in persistent or significant  incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly re ferred to as disabilities), congenital 
anomalies , or birth defects,must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if they occur at any time 
following treatment since they are considered to be a serious AE and must be reported 
to the sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b) . 
 
10.33 Death  
Reportable categories of Death  
 
 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as grade 5 
“Disease progression” in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.” 
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease 
process) should be submitted.  
 
• A
ny death occurring within [ADDRESS_488710] dose, regardless 
of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention requires 
expedited reporting within 24 hours.  
 
• A ny death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_488711] 
intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only 
if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
intervention. 
 
• When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, 
“Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information 
Form should be completed and submitted, along with any additional medical information (form is available on the CTEP 
website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/). The potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy 
agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” 
section of the CTEP -AERS report . 
 
• In CTCAE v5.0, pregnancy loss is defined as “Death in utero,” and any pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions SOC. A pregnancy loss should NOT be 
reported as a Grade 5 event under the Pregnancy, puerperium 
Z11102 
43 
Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #08  and perinatal conditions SOC as currently CTEP -AERS 
recognizes this event as a patient death.  
 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4, 
“Death neonatal” under the General disorders and 
administration SOC.  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_488712] be reported via CTEP -AERS whether or not they 
are thought to be related to either previous or current treatment. All new 
malignancies should be reported, i.e. solid tumors (including non- melanoma 
skin malignancies), hematologic malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia, and in situ tumors. In CTCAE v5.0, 
secondary malignancies may be reported as one of the following three options: 1) Leu kemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy, 2) Myelodysplastic 
syndrome, or 3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy. Whenever possible, 
the CTEP- AERS reports for new malignancies should include tumor pathology, 
history or prior tumors, prior treatment/current treatment including duration, any associated risk factors or evidence regarding how long the new malignancy may have been present, when and how the new malignancy was detected, 
molecular characterization or cytogenetics of the original tumor (if available) and of any new tumor, and new malignancy treatment and outcome, if available.  
 
10.35 Second Malignancy  
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior 
malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Seco nd 
malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via CDUS.

least two weeks to receive the kits. Kits will arrive inside the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_19263]. 
Kits will not be sent via rush delivery service unless the requesting site provides 
their own FedEx® account number or alternate billing number for express 
service. Alliance will not cover the cost for rush delivery of kits.  
 
14.32 Blood Processing and Submission 
Ship two 10 mL EDTA  tube s with a properly prepared cold pack.  See kit 
instructions for specific details for cold pack preparation (i.e., frozen or refrigerated) and proper packing of blood and cold pack to avoid freezing of 
specimen.

the pathology department as soon as possible (generally speaking, this 
means within 15 minutes after the time of tissue resection). If possible, 
in order to accurately record the ex vivo ischemia time, the time at 
which the specimens are excised from the patient should be recorded. The specimens should be kept fresh and not put into any 
type of fixative, although it may be transported to pathology in a solution of normal saline or any other physiologic buffer. The 
specimens should be reviewed by [CONTACT_389934]

procedures. Any remaining tissue may be sent to the Alliance Central 
Specimen Bank.  
 
 Wh ere possible, representative and grossly apparent tumor tissue from 
each foci of  disease  and one sample of intervening normal breast tissue 
should be collected. Where two foci of disease are resected in one 
lumpectomy, non- malignant tissue from the area between the two  
tumors should also be submitted. Where two separate foci of disease 
are resected in separate lumpectomies, non -malignant tissue from the 
area between the two tumors is not required  to be submitted. Normal 
tissue from the margin of the lumpectomy specimen can be submitted as the intervening normal tissue. Tissue that is grossly necrotic, 
hemorrhagic  or cauterized should be avoided. Tissue should be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_389888] 1 cm

possible (but at least one) of these sized segments should be collected from each  site of disease .  
 
If the foci a re removed separately and margins on both are negative, it 
is assumed that the radiographic distance (closest distance by [CONTACT_389935]) would be the appropriate separation. 
 
 Place the tissue segments in the tissue cassettes provided (usually 2 -3 
segments of tissue per cassette). Use multiple cassettes if necessary - do not “stuff” large amounts of tissue into a single cassette. Label the 
cassette with 'T' for tumor or 'N' for non -malignant tissue using the 
marker provided. Wrap each cassette in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_18087] (provided in the 
kit). Place the cassette at one end of the foil and roll the foil around the 
cassette. Carefully fold over the ends of the foil and crease them tightly 
to create a sealed, compact packet. Immediately immerse the foil -
wrapped casse tte in liquid nitrogen for [ADDRESS_488727] surgical pathology frozen section rooms. If 
using a cryobath, be certain that the temperature of the bath is at or 
below − 40° C. As a last option, specimens may be frozen by [CONTACT_389936] / dry- ice bath. Specimens should be left in the 
cryobath or dry ice bath for at least 15 minutes to ensure complete 
freezing. Specimens should not be frozen by [CONTACT_389937] 
− 80° C freezer or inside a cryostat. The time at which the tissue is 
frozen should be recorded so that, together with the recorded time 
of operative resection, the ex vivo warm ischemia time can be 
calculated.  
 
Once f r

more of the zip-lock bags provided. Be certain that the specimen bag is accurately and legibly labeled with the patient study ID number. Once 
frozen, take extreme care not to let the tissue sp ecimen thaw.   If an 
ultra-cold freezer (i.e., −  80° C or colder) is not  available, the 
specimen s must be shipped the same day they are collected and

shipped ( ≤ 30 days after surgery ). The specimen s must be shipped with 
sufficie nt dry ice for up to two days. Specimens must remain frozen 
at all times.  
 
If re
sources are not available at the site to collect snap frozen 
surgical tissue, FFPE tissues must be submitted (see next section).  
 
 
14.332 FFPE Tissue Processing and Submission  
FFPE blocks/slides should be submitted from each of the foci of 
malignancy and also where available from the interven ing non-
malignant tissue (as described above). The block/slides must be 
appropriately packed to prevent damage (i.e., slides should be placed in 
appropriate slide container) and placed in an individual plastic bag. Tissue specimens must be shipped ≤ 30 days after surgery.

DNA will be extracted from EDTA whole blood and white blood cell s will be 
prepared from residual blood.  Similar to the tumor samples being collected in 
this study (see the following section ), DNA will be isolated and subjected to 1) 
gene expression profiling; 2) array comparative hybridization; and 3 ) gene 
sequencing fo r significantly mutated genes. These studies will be performed in 
conjunction with the tumor studies.

same systemic approach.  
 
To begin to explore this question we will apply genomic approaches, including 
gene expression, gene copy and gene sequencing to the multiple tumor sites to try 
to differentiate between these two possibilities. Tumors with similar gene 
expression profiles, copy number aberr ations and somatic m utations will be 
called related; tumors where these features are discordant will be called 
unrelated. Clearly one can also envisage the possibility of multi -clonality where 
two separate nodules have a common precursor but have diverged over time.  In 
this setting , the digital nature of next generation sequencing is very valuable, as 
not only will we be able to compare a list of mutations, but their frequency, 
allowing us to study clonality in an efficient way. 
 
These experiments will be conducted in two settings. The first setting  is in a 
subset of patients with three available data sources:  1) have consented to  whole 
genome sequencing ; 2) a frozen specimen from each tumor acquired by [CONTACT_389939] ; and 3) a germ -line specimen  (tube of peripheral blood). 
This will allow a very deep unbiased genomic analysis and will provide the most definitive data on the relatedness of two separate sites of disease in the breast.  The second setting  is where one of these three data sources is 
missing.   For patients who did not consent for genomic studies  or in whom only 
fixed material is available or the germline DNA is not available we will use 
techniques adapted to formalin fixed material to examine selected breast cancer 
genes for mutation or expression to determine relatedness.  
 
Since this type of analysis has not been attempted before, all statistics will be 
exploratory; however our primary hypothesis is that unrelated tumors that are

DNA and RNA will be isolated from each separa te tumor site and subjected to 1 ) 
gene expression profiling (addressing the question of whether the tumor foci 
have the same or different intrinsic subtype (basal-like, luminal A, luminal B, 
HER2 -enriched, claudin- low); 2 ) array co mparative hybridization (to determine 
whether they have the same or different patterns of gene copy variation, e.g., 
LOH and amplification) and 3) gene sequencing. The sequencing will be full genome in a subset of patients where high quality frozen samples were taken and 
are available from each tumor site. Then in all cases, a sequencing assay for 
significantly mutated genes in breast cancer can be performed on routinely 
formalin -fixed tumor material.  
 Formalin fixed surgical pathology blocks requested to accommodate individual 
patient management will be returned promptly upon request.

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodolog y 
16.1 Overview 
A single arm phase II clinical trial design will be used to assess whether the local recurrence (LR) rate at [ADDRESS_488732] conserving surgery is greater than 8 %.  
  16.[ADDRESS_488733] conserv ation  surgery with 2 or 3 sites of 
disease resected to negative margins (i.e. , not converted to mastectomy or have not 
refused mastectomy for positive margins) will be included in the analysis of the primary endpoint.  
 
Secondary clinical e ndpoint s are: 
 
• The conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins; poor 
cosmesis within the first year of attempting breast conservation surgery ( BCS); 
or inability to satisfy radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy 
bed of each site of disease  
 
• The type and severity of adverse effects of breast conserving surgery  and 
radiation  for women with multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer  (MIBC)   
 
• The radiation- related side effect s of whole breast radiation with a boost to 1 large 
or > 1 lumpectomy site  
 
• The patient’s perception of cosmesis.

16.3 Sample Size D etermination  
Assuming a cohort of 200 eligible patients is enrolled over a 2 year period, the follow-up 
period after the close of enrollment is 5 years, and the number of local recurrences 
follows a Poisson distribution, the upper bounds of 95 % confidence interval for the cumulative incidence of a local recurrence within 5 years would fall below 8  % if at most 
[ADDRESS_488734] a single contiguous area of malignancy 
at final pathology. During the course of the study, it was found that many patients were 
being deemed ineligible after enrollment because the distance between lesions was 
outside the allowable range. This caused a high rate of ineligibilities. The protocol was 
amended and the ineligibility rate has subsequently decreased. However, in order to obtain the 200 evaluable patients needed for the primary endpoint, the study will need to 
enroll a total of 265 (35 additional) patients. Hence the target accrual for the study is 265 
patients.  
 
16.4 Accrual Time  
American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC) version 7.[ADDRESS_488735] cancers (foci no more 
than 5 cm apart from each other in the same quadrant) or multicentric breast cancers (foci 
in different quadrants or foci in the same quadrant but more than 5 cm apart from each 
other). Moreover, the AJCC states that pathologic tumor size should be based only on the 
single largest tumor and recommends that pathologic T stage be designated as pTany(m) 
where m indicated th e number of multiple lesions. As the presence of multiple ipsilateral 
breast cancers (MIBC) are not routinely collected through AJCC staging or in the setting 
of breast cancer clinical trials, the incidence of this disease in general is not well known. 
Similarly, it is unknown how many women with MIBC have enrolled in clinical trials.  
Retrospective case studies estimate that 15  % of women diagnosed with breast cancer 
have MIBC. The estimated number of new female breast cancer cases in 2010 is 207,090 
(Jemal et al ., 2010) .  Assuming that 15  % of these cases will have multiple ipsilateral 
breast cancers (31,064 cases) and 3  to 5 % of these multiple ipsilateral breast cancer cases 
will consider participating in a clinical trial, there will be [ADDRESS_488736] event , the trial will stop as 
the 5 year local recurrence rate is unacceptably high.  
 
A conversion to mastectomy rate of 25 % or more is considered to be  
unacceptably high. As such, consideration will be given to discontinuing

Version Date: 09/11/2018  Update #[ADDRESS_488737]  100 women enrolled convert to

months of BCS. The lower bound for 95 % binomial confidence interval for the 
conversion rate is 25.7 % (if 35 of 100 women convert to a mastectomy) . 
 
16.[ADDRESS_488738] second 
primary cancers will not be considered competing risk. A 95 % Poisson confidence interval for the cumulative incidence of a local recurrence within 5 years will be constructed.  
 
Gentilini et al . reported that cumulative incidence of local recurrence differed in 
terms of estrogen receptor status, HER2/neu expression, Nottingham grade, and 
Ki-67 expression (univariately)  (Gentilini et al., 2009). Gray’s test will be used 
to explore whether the cumulative incidence of local recurrence differs with 
respect to these factors as well as progesterone receptor status, number of 
positive lymph nodes, number of foci, t- stage, age, perception of quality of life as 
measured by [CONTACT_389940] (poor: 0 to 3; middling: 4 to7; good/excellent: 
8 to 10), and fatigue as measured by [CONTACT_389940] (none to little: 0 to3; 
some: 4 to 7; a great deal : 8 to10).    
 
16.62 Conversion to Mastectomy  
The conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins; poor 
cosmesis within the first year of attempting BCS; or inability to satisfy the 
radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy bed of each site of 
disease  
 
All eligible patients who have initiated surgery will be included in the analysis of conversion to mastectomy. A 95 % binomial confidence interval will be 
constructed for the percentage of patients who converted to mastectomy. Logistic 
regression analysis will be used to assess whether the likelihood of conversion to 
mastectomy differed with respect to patient and/or disease characteristics.  
 
An interim efficacy  analysis will not be performed; final analysis will performed 
at year [ADDRESS_488739] 5 years of follow -up. 
 
Patients enrolled subsequent to surgery will be excluded from this analysis.

A subset analysis will be done of patients with close margins (< 2 mm) who did 
not undergo re- excision.  
The purpose is to see whether the inclusion of these patients inflated the local 
recurrence (LR) rate. In addition,  the LR rate of patients with close margins (< 2 
mm) who did not undergo re- excision will be estimated with point estimate and 
95% confidence interval.

lymphedema will be defined as a patient who has a symptom survey score >  [ADDRESS_488742] edema by [CONTACT_389941].  
  
16.66 Patient’s P erception of C osmesis 
All eligible patients who have undergone surgery that was not converted to a 
mastectomy will be included in these analyses .  
 Patient’s perception of cosmesis will be assessed at their initial post -operative 
visit as well as 1, 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_488743] -Q subscales: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction with overall 
outcome, and physical well-being.  
 
Patients registered after surgery will not partake in the pre- operative assessment 
but will be asked to complete subsequent cosmesis surveys.  
 The followin g statistical analyses will be conducted separately for those women 
who undergo an ALND and those who do not undergo an ALND.  
16.[ADDRESS_488744] -Q scoring module 
 
 For each of the subscales, a 95 % binomial confidence interval for t he 
proportion of patients reporting deficit s in that domain will be 
constructed. Also, a 95 % binomial confidence interval for t he 
proportion of patients indicating that their cosmesis result on the one item questionnaire was poor or fair (scores: 3 or 4) will be constructed. 
For each of the three subscales, a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used

assess which patients, disease, and/or treatment characteristics as well as of breast lymphedema are associated with an increased likelihood of 
each of the following endpoint: reporting a poor to fair cosmesis, poor satisfaction with breast cosmesis, poor satisfaction with overall outcome, and poor physical well-being.  
 
 The agreement between year [ADDRESS_488746] cosmesis, poor satisfaction with overall 
outcome, and poor physical well-being will be assessed using 
McNemar tests.  
 
16.663 Agreement with Su rgeon’s Perception o f Cosmetic Results at I nitial 
Post-surgical Evaluation 
 Impression of cosmesis will be dichotomized as poor to fair versus good to excellent. A 95 % confidence interval will be constructed for the proportion of cases where the patient and his surgeon agree in 
terms of cosmesis results.   
16.[ADDRESS_488747] initiated surgery will be included in the analysis of this endpoint. The maximum lesion dimension and location 
of each lesion found on mammogram will be determined on central review. Agreement between the lesion size on mammogram and the

using the approaches proposed by [CONTACT_148807]. That is, a plot of 
the average of lesion size on mammogram and the lesion size reported 
on surgical pathology report ver sus the difference in lesion size 
between that found on mammogram and that found on surgery will be constructed to examine systematic biases.  A 95  % z-confidence of the 
difference in lesion size between that found on mammogram and that 
found on surgery wi ll be constructed. Percent agreement will be used 
to assess the extent of agreement between location of the lesion seen

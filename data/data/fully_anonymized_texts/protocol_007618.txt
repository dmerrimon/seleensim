DOCUMENT HISTORY  
 
Document  Date of Issue Overall Rationale 
Amendment 03 17-Apr-2023 Protocol amended to widen the allowable range of body 
mass index (BMI) in the inclusion criterion to facilitate 
recruitment of participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD).

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment : 03 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment :  
The upper limit of the BMI is being increased from 40 to 46 kg/m2. This increase in the upper limit of the BMI is to facilitate 
recruitment. Based on review of the site database of eligible participants, the Sponsor was inform ed that many of the ESRD patients 
have BMIs that exceed 40  kg/m2. The upper limit of the BMI for the Sponsor clinical database for MK-6482, that includes adult 
patients with von Hippel- Lindau (VHL) who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (R CC), is 52 kg/m2. Therefore, the 
Sponsor has clinical experience with the use of MK -6482 in patients with BMIs exceeding 40 kg/m2. Based on a population 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) model, body weight (which is highly correlated with BMI) does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
PK of MK-6482. 
Related sections within the protocol were updated to reflect this change, as noted in chronological order below.

participants with healthy renal function are 
required to match the demographics of the 
participants with ESRD, the BMI of the healthy participants  was also widened .

2 INTRODUCTION  
MK-6482 (belzutifan) is a potent oral small molecule inhibitor of HIF -2α, that is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with VHL -RCC, CNS hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors not requiring immediate surgery. MK -6482 is also being evaluated as 
a treatment option for patients with solid tumor and patients with advanced RCC. HIF -2α is a 
transcription factor that is overexpressed in many cancers and promotes tumorigenesis. 
HIF-2α forms a heterodimeric com plex with HIF -1β (also called ARNT), and subsequently 
binds to hypoxic response elements of target genes which regulate hypoxic signaling, tumor 
cell growth and survival. MK-[ADDRESS_712263] UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 enzyme activity. A human ADME study (MK-6482-
008) is currently ongoing, and is anticipated to confirm that hepatic metabolism represents a 
major elimination pathway (>20% of the absorbed drug) for MK-6482. 
Renal excretion is not anticipated to represent a major clearance route for MK -6482. 
However, impaired renal function has been demonstrated to alter drug metabolism and 
transport pathways in the liver and gut, and these effects are more prominent i n patients with 
severely impaired renal function  (Dreisbach,  2009). As an example, CYP2C19 activity was 
reported to be reduced by 25% in patients with chronic renal impairment characterized by a GFR <50 mL/min ( Dreisbach,  2009). There are no published reports on the impact of renal 
impairment on UGT2B17 activity. Furthermore, since nephron-sparing surgery is often the treatment of choice for amenable RCC lesions, VHL -RCC patients may undergo multiple 
sequential renal surgeries, which can  lead to progressive worsening of renal function. In a 
retrospective analysis of 72 VHL patients with a median follow -up period of 61.5 months, 
30% of patients who underwent RCC surgery developed chronic kidney disease while 5% of patients developed ESRD and required HD (Kwon et al., 2014).

2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic  Background 
MK-6482 is a pote nt and selective inhibitor of HIF -2α both in vitro  and in vivo . HIF-2α is 
known to form a heterodimeric complex with HIF-1β, which is also referred to as ARNT; the 
heterodimer can then bind to hypoxic response elements in target genes and induce their transcription. The PAS domains of HIF are essential for heterodimerization of the HIF-2α:HIF-1β subunits, a prerequisite for target gene induction. A unique ligand-binding 
pocket has been identified in the PAS-B domain of HIF-2α ( Scheuermann et al.,  2013). 
MK-6482 binds in this pocket, thereby [CONTACT_544650]-2α:ARNT heterodimerization and 
directly inhibiting the function of HIF-2α. 
In tumor cells in which HIF -2α is activated, MK-6482 blocks the transcription of several 
genes involved in oncogenesis, including cyclin D1, VEGF- A, and the glucose transporter 
SLC2A1. MK -6482 has showed antitumor activity in mouse VHL-deficient tumor xenograft 
models with nearly complete regression of established  tumors after oral administration of 
MK-6482 at 0.3 mg/kg bid. No activity was observed with MK -[ADDRESS_712265] a panel of 
76 receptors and 8  ion channels (at concentrations up to 12.5 µM), and no off- target activity 
at [ADDRESS_712266] a panel of 40  protein kinases and 2 protein phosphatases. 
2.2.2 Preclinical and Clinical Studies 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
MK-6482 PK was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. MK-6482 has low aqueous 
solubility and high permeability (BCS Class 2) and is well absorbed following oral 
administration in animals at clinically relevant doses. The oral bioavailability of MK -6482 
was shown to be high in mice (approximately 100%), moderate in dogs and monkeys (33% and 53%, respectively), and low in rats (18%). The in vitro plasma protein binding of MK‑6482 ranged from 45 to 61% across species (45% in human plasma). 
Following an oral dose of [
14C]MK-[ADDRESS_712267] 
tissues and was reversible. The mean overall recovery of dose ranged from 93.9% to 97.1%. 
Biliary excretion accounted for 85% and 80.2% of the radioactive dose in bile-duct cannulated male  and female rats, respectively.  
In vitro and in vivo metabolism studies for MK -[ADDRESS_712268]:   MK-6482   33 
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-[ADDRESS_712269] for elimination of MK-6482 (≤4% of 
dose) and PT3317 (≤13% of dose) for rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
A summary of MK -6482 nonclinical PK and metabolism is contained in the IB supplied by 
[CONTACT_1034]. The IB should be reviewed in conjunction with this study protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical Toxicology  
MK-6482 was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames), nor in the 
in vitro micronucleus assay, indicating a low genotoxic risk from MK-[ADDRESS_712270] levels were decreased by 
[CONTACT_3450] 30 to 50 % at all doses. The effects on the RBC compartment were reversed once MK-6482 administration stopped and are considered an “on- target” pharmacologic 
activity of HIF -2α antagonism on EPO production. 
In the rat toxicity studies with MK -6482, off- target organ toxicity was identified in the  male 
reproductive system. The MK- 6482 related effects involved testes (smaller/soft testes and 
decreased weight associated with hypo -spermatogenesis, germ cell degeneration and 
multinucleated giant cells), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046] (oligospermia), and were not rever sible within 
26-week recovery periods. These findings were associated with decreased sperm motility and 
sperm counts, and increased number of abnormal sperms in the sperm analysis. No effects on 
sperm evaluation and histopathology of testes/epi[INVESTIGATOR_544641]. No 
effects on the female reproductive organs were observed in either rats or dogs.  
In a preliminary embryofetal toxicity study where pregnant rats were administered MK -6482, 
a significant level of post implantation loss indicative  of embryofetal lethality and/or reduced 
fetal body weight, reduced ossification, and malformations in surviving fetuses was observed at an exposure close to the clinically relevant exposure at 120 mg/day.

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Studies  
As of a cutoff date of 15- JUN-2021, MK -6482 has been administered as single or multiple 
doses to a total of 135 healthy participants. In addition, MK -6482 is being evaluated as 
monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer treatments in participants with solid 
tumors.  
Based on the overall integrated safety summary of MK -6482 monotherapy (N=181) across 
MK-6482-[ADDRESS_712272] anemia events were ≤Grade 2. Anemia is an on- target effect of MK -[ADDRESS_712273] of HIF on EPO expression and reduction in EPO and HGB levels with MK-6482 
administration. Anemia has been medically managed with erythropoiesis stimulating agent administration and/or blood transfusion as indicated  and dose interruption/reduction. 
Hypoxia is manage d by [CONTACT_544651]/reduction. Anemia due to decreased EPO and hypoxia should be closely monitored and medically managed as indicated. 
Single MK-[ADDRESS_712274] been administered to healthy participants in the completed  midazolam DDI study (MK-6482-009). 
MK-[ADDRESS_712275] of about 12% from baseline were observ ed in the completed mi dazolam DDI study 
(MK-6482-009) after multiple daily doses of [ADDRESS_712276] of EPO suppression for MK-6482. 
A summary of the MK -6482 clinical development program is contained in the IB supplied by 
[CONTACT_1034]. The IB should be reviewed in conjunction with this study protocol. 
2.2.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies  
There are 14 ongoing clinical studies with MK-6482 which include: 5 Phase 1 studies, 
1 Phase 1 b/2 study, 5 Phase 2 studies, and 3 Phase 3 studies. The Phase 1 studies include an 
assessment of safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic properties, and anti- tumor activity 
of MK-6482 in participants with advanced solid tumors (MK-6482- 001); investigation of 
absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance of MK -6482 in healthy participants 
(MK-6482-008); evaluation of MK-6482 as monotherapy and in combination with lenvatinib 
with or without pembrolizumab in China participants with advanced RCC (MK-6482-010); evaluation of safety and tolerabili ty of MK-[ADDRESS_712277]:   MK-6482   35

(MK-6482-018); and evaluation of the impact of crystalline drug substance on MK-6482 PK 
in healthy participants (MK -6482-019). The Phase 1b/2 study is an evaluation of immune and 
targeted combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_544642] (MK -3475-U03). The Phase 2 
studies include an evaluation of efficacy and safety of MK -6482 in patients with VHL- RCC 
an evaluation of efficacy and safety of MK -6482 in combination with cabozantinib in adult 
participants with adv anced ccRCC (MK -6482-003); evaluation of efficacy and safety of 
MK-6482 in patients with VHL- RCC (MK-6482-004); evaluation of efficacy and safety of 
MK-6482 in patients with advanced RCC (MK-6482-013); evaluation of efficacy and safety 
of MK-6482 monothera py in participants with advanced pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma 
or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (MK-6482-015); and evaluation of efficacy and safety of 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in combination with MK-6482 in multiple solid tumors (MK-6482-016). The ongoing Phase 3 studies include an evaluation of the efficacy and 
safety of MK -6482 in patients with advanced RCC (MK-6482-005); evaluation of MK-6482 
in combination with lenvatinib versus cabozantinib in participants with advanced RCC (MK-6482-011); and an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in 
combination with MK-6482 and lenvatinib, versus pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in participants with advanced ccRCC (MK -6482-012). In the ongoing trials, MK-[ADDRESS_712278] AEs being mild to moderate in severity.   
One case of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome resulting in death was reported in 
MK-6482-005 for a participant with advanced RCC, who received MK -6482 120 mg daily 
for approximately 2 weeks. The participant was also reported as experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatic failure, hypocalcemia and sepsis. T he Sponsor considers 
that there is no conclusive evidence to support a causal relationship between MK-6482 and 
the aforementioned events since there were several confounding factors in the causality 
assessment reported for these AEs, including but not limited to prior/concomitant 
medications,  and possible concurrent illnesses. However, the 
Sponsor cannot definitively exclude the possibility of a causal  relationship between MK-
6482 treatment and the reported events . Of note, more than 600 participants with solid 
tumors/advanced RCC have received MK-6482 as monotherapy or in combination with other 
anticancer treatments and no other case of multiple organ failure has been reported. The 
Sponsor will continue to monitor the safety profile of MK -6482 in the clinical program . 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Participants in clinical studies will not receive direct benefit from treatment during 
participation as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safety and properties of an investigational medicine. An indirect health benefit to the pa rticipants 
enrolled in this study is the free medical tests received at the prestudy (screening) visit  and 
during the study. 
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this 
clinical study may be found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents.

Assignment to renal function group will be as follows: 
Group N eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) 
ESRD 6 a Require dialysis 
Healthy matched control 6 a ≥ [ADDRESS_712285] equation will be calculated at screening. Baseline eGFR will be 
assessed during the screening period  for study eligibility. If a repeat measurement is obtained, the 
mean of the two values will be used to assess study eligibility.  At the discretion of the 
investigator, a measured CLcr as determined by a 24 -hour urine collection may be used to 
determine eligibility for enrollment. Participants with an eGFR (using the MDRD equation) up to 
10% below 90  mL/min/1.73 m2 (ie, ≥81 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be eligible for the study if their 
measured CLcr (based on a 24 -hour urine collection) is ≥90 mL/min . 
Following enrollment of the ESRD group, the healthy control group will be enrolled. Each 
healthy control participant will be matched to the mean age (± 15 years), BMI (± 20%), sex (with a similar male/female ratio in each group), and UGT2B17 genotype (at least 2 IMs and 
2 EMs) of participants with ESRD. If a UGT2B17 PM ESRD participant is enrolled in the study, a UGT2B17 PM healthy matched control participant should be included in the control group. If after reasonable efforts, a UGT2B17 PM healthy matched control participant cannot 
be enrolled, an additional ESRD participant (ie, a [ADDRESS_712286] participant), who is not 
UGT2B17 PM, will be enrolled. This additional ESRD participant should be matched to the 
mean age (± 15 years) and BMI (± 20%) of the other [ADDRESS_712287] participants. The final healthy 
matched control participant (ie, the 6th healthy control participant), who is also not UGT2B17 
PM, should also be matched to the mean age (± 15 years), BMI (± 20%), and sex (with a similar male/female ratio in each group) of the [ADDRESS_712288] participants (ie, not including the [ADDRESS_712289] participant). 
ESRD participants will receive a single oral dose of [ADDRESS_712290] participants will receive a single oral dose o f 120 mg 
MK-6482 immediately following completion of their normally scheduled HD, followed by 
72 hours of blood sampling for PK assessment of MK-6482. For participants following a 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday HD schedule, MK -6482 will be administered immediately 
following their Friday HD session. For participants following a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday 
HD schedule, study intervention will be administered immediately following their Saturday HD session. The participant’s next regularly scheduled HD session (either Monday or Tuesday) should initiate immediately following the 72-hour blood draw.

4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The primary endpoints for this study will include the PK parameters of AUC0 -inf and Cmax 
of MK-6482. Plasma PK parameters included in this primary endpoint will be evaluated and 
compared between participants with ESRD before and after HD compared to participants 
with healthy renal function, using GMR and CI to assess differences between these two 
groups.  
The secondary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the extent of MK -6482 removal by [CONTACT_544653]  (CLD, plasma). The plasma parameter included in this secondary endpoint will be 
evaluated and compared between participants with ESRD before and after HD compared to 
participants with healthy renal function. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints  
Safety and tolerability of MK -[ADDRESS_712293] common adverse drug reactions identified based on the integrated aggregate safety 
assessment  in VHL-RCC and RCC patients  of all available information include: hypoxia, 
anemia, fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness. Therefore, the standard safety monitoring of AEs , 
physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, pulse oximetry, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum  chemistry, and urinalysis), obtained throughout the study are 
appropriate to assess safety and tolerability of MK -6482 in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_712294] a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug ADME; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or 
molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants.  
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under study, or related diseases. They  may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic 
tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic research may consist of the analysis of [ADDRESS_712295]:   MK-6482   41 
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-[ADDRESS_712296] on MK -6482 PK and drug 
response. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Future Biomedi cal Research  
The Sponsor will conduct FBR on DNA specimens for which consent was provided during this clinical study.  
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriately consented 
participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for FBR is to explore and 
identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their 
therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct  time. The details of FBR are presented in Appendix 6. 
4.[ADDRESS_712297] participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the 
participant is unable to be contact[CONTACT_19379]). 
A study may be paused during review of newly available preclinical/clinical safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, efficacy, or biologic data or other items of interest, prior to a final 
decision on continuation or termination of the study. It may be necessary to keep the study 
open for gathering/reviewing of additional supportive data to optimally complete the

appropriate communication(s) will be generated. If the decision has been made to end the 
study following this review period, the study end will be defined as the date of the Sponsor

4.4.1 Clinical Criteria for Early Study Termination  
There are no prespecified criteria for terminating the study early . 
5 STUDY POPULATION 
Vasectomized or surgically sterilized male participants and female participants of 
nonchildbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 75 years (inclusive) will be enrolled in 
this study.  
Participants with normal renal function will match to the mean demographic parameters of 
the ESRD group. Healthy control participants will be matched for the mean age (± 15 years), mean BMI (± 20%), sex ( with a similar male/female ratio in each group), and UGT2B17 
genotype (at least 2 IMs and 2 EMs)  of the ESRD group. If a UGT2B17 PM ESRD 
participant is enrolled in the study, a UGT2B17 PM healthy matched control participant should be included in the contro l group. If after reasonable efforts, a UGT2B17 PM healthy 
matched control participant cannot be enrolled, an additional ESRD participant (ie, a [ADDRESS_712298] participant), who is not UGT2B17 PM, will be enrolled. This additional ESRD participant should be matched to the mean age (± 15 years) and BMI (± 20%) of the other [ADDRESS_712299] participants. The final healthy matched control participant (ie, the 6
th healthy control 
participant), who is also not UGT2B17 PM, should also be matched to the mean age (± 15 years), BMI  (± 20%), and sex (with a similar male/female ratio in each group) of the 
[ADDRESS_712300] participants (ie, not including the [ADDRESS_712301] participant). 
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study. 
As certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discontinuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled 
follow-up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all 
participants who discontinue study intervention before completion of the protocol- specified 
treatment period will still continue to participate in th e study as specified in Section 1.[ADDRESS_712327] occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by [CONTACT_88682], the study plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section  8.1.10. 
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention, but continue to be monitored in the study, for any of the following reasons: 
• The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue study intervention. 
• The participant has a medical conditi on or personal circumstance which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_19348]/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from continued administration of study intervention. 
• The participant has a positive drug screen at any time during the course of the study (with 
the exception for positive drug screen due to prescription drug use that is approved by [CONTACT_198340]) . The drug screen can be confirmed by a recheck at the 
discretion of the investigator after discussion with the Sponsor.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 
8.4.3 Follow-u p of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Information  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAEs, and other reportable safety events, 
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECIs, cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). In addition, the investigator will 
make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in allocated participants for 
outcome. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]R s according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) fr om the Sponsor will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding  
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to the investigator or their designee), including the pregnancy of a male participant’s female partner, that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor. 
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of 
a pregnancy w ill be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing fetus will be born 
with severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that leads to an elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an SAE for the fetus. 
Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
8.4.6 Disease-r elated Events and/or Disease-r elated Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs

*Note: These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study- site guidance for assessment 
and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent). 
It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in 
the setting of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Director. However, abnormalities of liver blood tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not ECIs for this study. 
3. An AE of anemia  
4. An AE of hypoxia 
5. An AE of dyspnea 
 
8.5 Treatment of Overdose  
For purposes of this study, an overdose will be defined as any dose of any drug administered 
as part of the study exceeding the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_760]. It is up to the investigator or the reporting physician to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor. 
8.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma samples for evaluation of MK -6482 PK will be collected at scheduled time points as 
delineated in the SoA.  
The decision as to which plasma samples collected will be measured for evaluation of PK 
will be collaboratively determined by [CONTACT_1034]. If indicated, these samples may also be 
measured and/or pooled for assay in an expl oratory manner for metabolites.

8.11.6 Study Design/Dosing/Procedures Modifications Permitted Within Protocol 
Parameters  
This is a Phase 1 assessment of MK -6482 in humans, and the PK, pharmacodynamic, and 
safety profiles of the compound are still being elucidated. This protocol is written with some flexibility to accommodate the inherent dynamic nature of Phase 1 clinical studies. Modifications to clinical or laboratory procedures currently outlined may be required to achieve the scientific goals of the study objectives and/or to ensure appropriate safety monitoring of the study participants.  
• Instructions to take study intervention with or without food or drink may also be modified based on newly available data 
• Modification of the PK/pharmacodynamic sample processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_544644] (eg, to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentrations). If indicated, these collected samples may also be assayed in an exploratory manner for metabolites and/or pharmacodynamic markers. 
Up to an additional 50 mL of blood may be drawn for safety and/or PK analyses. The total 
blood volume withdrawn from any single participant will not exceed the maximum allowable volume during their  participation in the entire study ( Appendix 8).  
The timing of procedures for assessment of safety procedures (eg, vital signs, ECG, safety laboratory tests, pulse oximetry, etc) may be modified during the study based on newly available data. Additional safety laboratory tests may be added to blood samples previously

9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN 
Data will be handled and processed  according to Celerion SOPs, which are written based on 
the principles of GCP. 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analyses for this study. Full detail is 
in the SAP to be provided separately. 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical a nalyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in an SAP. The SAP will be prepared by [CONTACT_544662]. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoints definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment. Additional statistical analyses other than those described 
in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate. 
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses  
The statistical analysis o f the data obtained from this study will be conducted by [CONTACT_544663].  
If, after the study has begun, changes are made to the statistical analysis stated below, then 
these deviations to the plan will be listed, along with an explanation as to why they occurred, 
in the CSR.  
9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation  
Primary Estimation: 
Estimation : The plasma PK (AUC0 -inf and Cmax) of MK-[ADDRESS_712353] before and after HD will be estimated 
and compared to each other and to those in healthy matched control participants.  
Secondary Estimation: 
Estimation : The extent to which MK-6482 is removed by [CONTACT_544664] 
(eg, CLD,  
plasma) will be estimated.

received. 
All Participants as Treated (APaT): The All Participants as Treated Population consists of all 
participants who received at least one dose of study intervention. This population will be 
used for assessments of safety and tolerability.  
Per-Protocol (PP) : The Per-Protocol Population consists of the subset of participants who 
comply with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that generated data will be likely to exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model. Compliance covers 
such considerations as exposure to treatment, availability of measurements and absence of important protocol deviations. Important protocol deviations will be identified to the extent possible prior to unblinding by [CONTACT_26378]/compliance, and its analysis and interpretation. Any participants or data values excluded from analysis will be identified, along with their reason for exclusion, in the CSR. At the end of the study, all participants who are compliant with the study procedure as aforementioned and have 
available data considered sufficient to exhibit the effect of treatment will be included in the 
Per-Protocol dataset. This population will be used for the PK analyses. 
9.6 Statistical Methods  
9.6.1 PK Descriptive Statistics  
Individual values will be listed for each plasma PK parameter by [CONTACT_544665], and the 
following (non-model- based) descriptive statistics will be provided: N (number of 
participants with non -missing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent 
CV (calculated as [ADDRESS_712357] deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric percent CV (calculated as 100  x sqrt(exp(s
2) – 1), where s2 is 
the observed variance on the natural log -scale. 
08RR0F
PRODUCT:   MK-6482   78 
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-[ADDRESS_712358] (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation will be used to estimate 
GFR standardized  to a BSA of 1.73 m2: 
eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 × standardized serum creatinine (mg/dL)-1.154× age-0.203 × 
(0.742 if female) × (1.212 if Black or African American).  
2. BSA un-normalized eGFR  
The MDRD equation provides an estimate of GFR standardized to a BSA  of 1.73 m2, and 
it is therefore necessary to multiply this estimate by [CONTACT_20908]’s ratio of BSA/1.73 
to determine the participant specific BSA un -normalized GFR:  
eGFR (mL/min) = eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) × [BSA (m2) / 1.73]. 
The BSA of an individual is calculated using the following equation:  
BSA (m2) = [weight (kg)0.425 × height (cm)0.725] × 0.007184. ( Dubois and Dubois, 1916, 
Wang et al., 1992) Note:  The participants categorized into different renal categories based on BSA 
normalized eGFR may not fall into the same renal categories after re -categorization b ased 
on BSA un- normalized eGFR.  
3. CLcr using the C-G Equation 
CLcr will be estimated using the following equation: 
CLcr 
 = {[140 - age(yr)] × [body wt (kg)] × (0.85 if female)} / [72 × serum creat 
(mg/dL)] 
Note:  The participants categorized into different renal categories based on eGFR using 
MDRD equation may not fall into the same renal categor ies after re -categorization  based 
on CLcr by C-G equation.

measures (before and after HD) within each ESRD participant via the REPEATED and 
SUBJECT statement in SAS PROC MIXED. Kenward and Roger’s method will be used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effect (DDFM=KR). Ninet y 
percent (90%) CIs for the least squares means for each population will be constructed on the 
natural log scale and will reference the t -distribution. Exponentiating the least- squares means 
and their corresponding 90% confidence limits will yield estimates for the population 
geometric means and confidence intervals about the geometric means on the original scale. 
Sample SAS code is given below: 
proc mixed  data=data;  
class population subject;  
model lnpk = population /ddfm=kr;  
repeated population/ subject=subject type=UN;  
lsmeans population /cl alpha=0.10; 
lsmeans population/pdiff alpha=0.10;  
run;  
 
To address the primary estimation objective and compare participants with ESRD before and after HD to participants with normal renal function, a two sided 90% CI for the difference in 
least-squares means (ESRD before HD – normal renal function, ESRD after HD – normal 
renal function) will be calculated for each PK parameter using the aforementioned model. 
These confidence limits will be exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI  for the ratio of geometric 
means (ESRD before HD/normal renal function, ESRD after HD/normal renal function) for 
each PK parameter. The same approach will be used to address the secondary estimation 
objective. The extent to which MK-6482 is removed from plasma by [CONTACT_544666] (ESRD before HD – ESRD after HD), the geometric mean ratio 
(ESRD before HD/ESRD after HD) and their 90% CIs. A sensitivity analysis may be 
performed without PMs  at UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 if applicable as deemed clinically 
appropriate.  
Figures showing summary plasma concentration- time profiles by [CONTACT_544667] -6482 
(linear plot with arithmetic mean (±SD) for concentration and semi- log plot with arithmetic 
mean) will be provided. A table showing summary PK parameter values with GMs (%GCV) 
by [CONTACT_66067], will be provided for MK -6482 AUC0-inf, AUC0 -24, Cmax, Tmax, and 
apparent terminal t½. A table showing the GMR (ESRD before HD /normal renal function, 
ESRD after HD/normal renal function, ESRD before HD/ESRD after HD) and corresponding 90% CI will be provided for PK parameters, AUC0 -inf and Cmax .  
Individual values will be listed for each PK parameter for MK -6482 (AUC0-inf, AUC0 -last,

and/or CYP2C19 phenotypes separately. 
Individual participant PK parameter values will also be plotted against BSA normalized 
eGFR and against BSA un-normalized eGFR, using different symbols to identify participants 
from each population. For this analysis, eGFR may be calculated as the mean of the two 
values determined at the prestudy (screening) visit . Plots of PK parameters versus CLcr  
obtained from C-G equation may be provided. Additionally, plots of PK parameter values 
versus age and BMI may be provided. PK conce ntration listings for MK -6482 in plasma,

was not chosen to satisfy any a priori statistical requirement. This sample size (N=6 per 
group) has historically been shown to be sufficient for studies of this type and should provide adequate data to support the planned analyses. Nevertheless, estimates of the expected precision of the estimates, based on these sample sizes and the known variability obtained from renal PK studies are presented below.

90% CIs expected for the given sample size and assumed variability. The observed 
between-participant coefficients of variation were 62.44% (~0.[ADDRESS_712363] deviation on the 
log scale) and 56.29% (~0.[ADDRESS_712364] deviation on the log scale) for AUC0- inf from 
food-effect study (Protocol MK-6482-002) and comparative bioavailability study (Protocol 
MK-6482-006), respectively. Assuming a sample size of 6 participants per population and 
observed between-participant SD is 0.574 on the log scale, then the half width of the 90% CI 
of GMR for MK-6482 AUC0 -inf on the log scale will be 0.545. The lower and upper 90% 
confidence limits for the GMR will be given by [CONTACT_111963]/1.72 and OBS*1.72 for AUC0 -inf, 
where OBS is the observed GMR. Thus, for example, if the observed GMR for AUC0 -inf 
was 1.50, then the approximate 90% CI for the GMR would be [0.87, 2.59]. 
Similarly, the observed between -participant coefficients of variation were 26.04% 
(~0.256 SD  on the log scale) and 25.25% (~0.249 SD  on the log scale) for Cmax from 
Protocol MK -6482-002 and Protocol MK -6482-006, respectively. Assuming a sample siz e of 
6 participants per population and observed between-participant SD is 0.256 on the log scale, 
then the half width of the 90% CI of GMR for MK -6482 Cmax on the log scale will be 
0.243. The lower and upper 90% confidence limits for the GMR will be given by [CONTACT_111963]/1.28 and OBS*1.28 for Cmax. Thus, for example, if the observed GMR for Cmax was 1.50, then the approximate 90% CI for the GMR would be [1.18, 1.91].

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study O versight Considerations 
10.1.[ADDRESS_712365] for Clinical Trials 
[COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, [LOCATION_003]  (MSD) 
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials  
I. Introduction 
A. Purpose 
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials will be conducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and  
regulations), and International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP), and also in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
B. Scope 
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
[CONTACT_19481] (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator-initiated trials, which are not under the 
full control of MSD.  
II. Scientific Issues  
A. Trial Conduct  
1. Trial Design  
Except for pi[INVESTIGATOR_19354], cl inical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpo int measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.  
The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific 
purpose of the trial  and shall respect the data protection rights of all participan ts, trial site staff and, where 
applicable, third parties . All trial protocols are and will be assessed for the need and capability to enroll 
underrepresented groups. Participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.  
2. Site Selection 
MSD’s clinical trials are conducted globally in many different countries and in diverse populations, including 
people of varying age, race, ethnicity, gender, and accounting for other potential disease related factors. MSD selects investigative sites  based on medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities 
and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by [CONTACT_26397] (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability to 
successfully conduct the trial.  
08RR0F
PRODUCT:   MK-6482   83 
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
Where appropriate, and in accordance with regulatory authority guidance, MSD will make concerted efforts 
to raise awareness of clinical trial opportunities in various communities. MSD will seek to engage 
underrepresented groups and those disproportionately impacted by [CONTACT_26398]. MSD will support 
clinical trial investigators to enroll underrepresented groups and expand access to those who will ultimately 
use the products under investigation.  
3. Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity 
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consisten cy. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if  
potential fraud, scientific/research misconduct , privacy incidents/breaches  or Clinical Trial-related 
Significant Quality Issues are reported, such matters are investigated. When necessary, appropriate corrective 
and/or preventative actions are defined and regulatory authorities and/or ethics review committees are 
notified. 
B. Publication and Authorship  
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pi[INVESTIGATOR_26346] -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing; in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by [CONTACT_19482]. 
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by [CONTACT_26399] (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications. 
III. Participant Protection  
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC]) 
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_88708]/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.  
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial documents must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. 
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with local and/or national regulations.  
B. Safety 
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, tr ial designs will take into account the local standard of care.  
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained. Participants may withdraw from an MSD trial at any time, without any  influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.  
08RR0F
PRODUCT:   MK-6482   84 
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-[ADDRESS_712366] extent possible , as well as all 
applicable data protection rights. Unless required by [CONTACT_2371], only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting on 
behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records 
that might identify the participant by [CONTACT_2300].  
D. Genomic Research  
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by [CONTACT_88709].  
IV. Financial Considerations  
A. Payments to Investigators  
Clinical trials are time - and labor-intensive. It is MS D’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging,  additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.  
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible participants.  
B. Clinical Research Funding  
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_19487], and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a source of funding.  
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests 
Funding of travel by [CONTACT_19488] (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices.  
V. Investigator Commitment 
Investigators will be expected to review MSD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. 
 
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure  
Financial disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Admi nistration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230] (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor’s responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for financial disclosure information is required. It is the investigator’s/subinvestigator’ s 
responsibility to comply with any such request. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by [CONTACT_19489] 
21 CFR Part 54, to provide their  financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor 
to allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements.

10.3 Appendix 3: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-u p, and Reporting  
10.3.1 Definition of AE  
AE definition 
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention. 
• Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention. 
• Note: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as  Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, medical device, combination product, or protocol specified procedure whether investigational or marketed  (including placebo, active comparator product, or run-in 
intervention) , manufact ured by, licensed by, provided by, or distributed by [CONTACT_88715]. 
 
Events meeting the AE definition 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. 
• For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
• Surgical procedure(s) planned prior to  informed consent to treat a preexisting condition 
that has not worsened. 
• Refer to Section 8.4.6 for protocol-specific exceptions.  
10.3.2 Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met. 
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening  
• The term “life -threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, even if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19358] a preexisting condition that has not worsened is not an SAE.) A preexisting condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to  the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history. 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
f. Other important medical events  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may

• Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
10.3.3 Additional Events Reported  
Additional events that require reporting  
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor. 
• Is a cancer  
• Is associated with an overdose  
10.3.4 Recording AE and SAE  
AE and SAE r ecording 
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.   
• The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE eCRFs/worksheets at each examination.  
• It is not acceptable for the  investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE e CRF page.   
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_88650]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_47957].  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity 
• An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. 
 
• The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following 
categories:  
- Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities (for pediatric studies, awareness of symptoms, but easily tolerated).  
- Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to inter fere with normal 
everyday activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong). 
- Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities).  
Assessment of causality 
• Did the Sponsor’s product cause the AE? 
• The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the AE will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures tha t a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information. 
• The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor’s 
product caused the AE: 
- Exposure:  Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the 
Sponsor’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
- Time Course:  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug- induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal 
product)? 
- Likely Cause:  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_19511], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors. 
- Dechallenge:  Was the Sponsor’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?

◦ If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
◦ If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.  
◦ If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_55530]’s 
product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.) 
- Rechallenge:  Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor’s product in this study? 
◦ If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
◦ If yes, this is a pos itive rechallenge.  
◦ If no, this is a negative rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single-dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor’s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.) 
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_26370]’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_93333], AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
IRB/IEC.  
• Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor’s product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology? 
• The assessment of relationship will be reported on the eCRFs/worksheets by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician according to their best clinical judgment, including consideration of the above elements. 
• Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a Sponsor’s product relationship). 
- Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship: 
◦ There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor’s product. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor’s product is reasonable. The AE is more likel y explained by [CONTACT_1034]’s product than by 
[CONTACT_5748].  
- No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship: 
◦ Participant did not receive the Sponsor’s product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of th e Sponsor’s product is not reasonable 
OR the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_26372]’s product. (Also entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)

• The investigator must review and provide an assessment of causali ty for each AE/SAE 
and document this in the medical notes. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigato r always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change their opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the upda ted causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.   
Follow-up of AE and SAE  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/o r evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_19514]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.   
• New or updated information will be recorded in the e CRF. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
10.3.5 Reporting of AEs , SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor  
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via e lectronic data 
collection tool 
• The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool. 
- Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent). 
- If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper AE Reporting form. 
◦ Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off- line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off-line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE for m or by [CONTACT_756] (see next section).  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).

SAE reporting to the Sponsor via p aper CRF  
• If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_22855].  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. 
• Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

Research  
1. Definitions  
a. Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may 
be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disea se or condition.

b. Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics 
as related to drug/vaccine response.2 
c. Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence 
of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2 
d. DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. 
e. RNA: Ribonucleic acid.  
 
2. Scope of Future Biomedical Research3, 4 
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section  8.9 will be 
used in various experiments to understand: 
• The biology of how drugs/vaccines work 
• Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by [CONTACT_10489] 
• Other pathways with which drugs/vaccines may interact 
• The biology of disease 
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development. 
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by [CONTACT_63558]. 
3. Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research
3, 4 
a. Participants for Enrollment  
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enrollment in future biomedical research . 
b. Informed Consent  
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a study 
visit by [CONTACT_544672]. Informed consent for future biomedical 
research should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If 
delayed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by

the participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secu re storage for 
regulatory reasons.  
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the 
Sponsor’s clinical document repository. 
c. eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research  Specimens 
Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical research  will be captured 
in the eCRFs. Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified 
will be destroyed. 
d. Future Biomedical Research  Specimen(s)  
Collection of specimens for future biomedical research  will be performed  as outlined 
in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future biomedical research , these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for other study purposes. 
4. Confidential Participant In formation for Future Biomedical Research
3, 4 
In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with future biomedical research  
specimens, it is critical to link participants ' clinical information with future test results. In 
fact, little or no resear ch can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing participant characteristics like sex, age, medical history and intervention outcomes are 
critical to understa nding clinical context of analytical results.  
To maintain privacy of information collect ed from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical research , the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single-coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.  
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical research  
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 
5. Biorepository Specimen Usage
3, [ADDRESS_712374] party (eg, a university investigator) designated by [CONTACT_1034]. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope o f analysis outlined in future biomedical research  protocol and consent . 
Future biomedical research  specimens remaining with the third party after specific 
analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-[ADDRESS_712375] the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@ MSD.com). Subsequently, the participant's specimens 
will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to study use only. If specimens were 
collected from study  participants specifically for FBR, these specimens will be removed 
from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator 
confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, 
if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction 
or already performed before the request being received by [CONTACT_93336]. No new analyses would be 
generated after the request is received.  
If the medical records for the study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no 
longer required by [CONTACT_544673]) or the specimens 
have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the 
participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 
7. Retention of Specimens
3, [ADDRESS_712376] results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access.

9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants3, 4 
No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the participant include: lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation. 
If important research fin dings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to

10.9 Appendix 9: Algorithm for Assessing Out of Range Laboratory Values 
For all laboratory values obtained at prestudy (screening) visit and/or predose evaluation: 
A. If all protocol-specified laboratory values are normal, the participant may enter the study. 
B. If a protocol specified laboratory value is outside of the parameter(s) outlined in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (including a repeat if performed), the participant will be 
excluded from the study. 
C. If ≥1 protocol- specified laboratory value not specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
is outside the normal range, the following choices are available:  
a. The participant may be excluded from the study. 
b. The participant may be included in the study if the abnormal value(s) is NCS (the 
investigator must annotate the laboratory value “NCS” on the laboratory safety 
test source d ocument). 
c. The participant may be included in the study if the abnormality is consistent with a pre-existing medical condition which is not excluded per protocol (eg, elevated 
eosinophil count in a participant with asthma or seasonal allergies), the medical  
condition should be annotated on the laboratory report. 
OR 
d. The abnormal test may be repeated (refer items a. and b. below for continuation of algorithm for repeated values).  
a. If the repeat test value is within the normal range, the participant may enter the study. 
b. If the repeat test value is still abnormal, the study investigator will evaluate the potential participant with a complete history and physical examination, looking especially for diseases that could result in the abnormal laboratory value in ques tion. If such diseases can be ruled out, 
and if the abnormal laboratory value is not clinically relevant, then the participant may enter the study. 
D. If there is any clinical uncertainty regarding the significance of an abnormal value, the participant will be excluded from the study.

Diagnosis and main criteria for 
inclusion  Men or women aged 18 years and older, inclusive  
Systemic Sclerosis as defined by 2013 the American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) / European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 
classification.  
Patients had to have at least one visible, active ischemic  digital ulcer (DU) or 
painful indeterminate DU  at screening located at or distal to the proximal 
interphalangeal joint, and that developed or worsened within 8 weeks prior to 
screening  
Oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiot ensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are permitted if the participant is on a 
stable dose for ≥ [ADDRESS_712608] use reliable methods of contraception.  
Study design  Randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multicenter, US study  
Methodology  This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of riociguat (1 
mg, 
1.5 mg, 2 mg and 2.5 mg TID; 0.[ADDRESS_712609] dose administered if the 
participant experiences side effects) in patients with SSc -DU. The study 
consists of two parts:  1) a main double -blind placebo -controlled 16 -week 
study treatment phase, and 2) an optional 16 -week open -label extension phase 
for participants with active digital ulcer/reoccurrence of digital ulcers within 1 
month of the end of the main treatment phase.  
Type of control  Placebo  
Number of participants  20 randomized participants  
Primary variable  Change in digital ulcer net burden from baseline to the end of the double -blind 
study treatment phase  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 5 of 56  
Plan for statistical analysis  The planned sample size of 20 SSc participants is based on practical 
considerations to obtain preliminary estimates of the magnitude of treatment 
differences in efficacy and safety rather than a desired power for a pre - 
specified difference as would be nec essary for a confirmatory study. 
However, with this proposed sample of 20 participants (10 riociguat and 10 
placebo), we can calculate the magnitude of treatment differences (riociguat – 
placebo) for the primary efficacy endpoint – the change from baseline  to end 
of double - blind treatment in digital ulcer net burden (a continuous endpoint), 
or safety outcomes – characterized by [CONTACT_544858]. There would be 80% power to detect an effect size (mean 
treatment difference divided by [CONTACT_157516]) of 1.253 or greater with a 
two-sided type I error of 5% in the primary endpoint. Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_544837], the difference between mean change in digital ulcer net 
burden between riociguat and placebo tha t can be detected with sufficient 
power is large. Similarly, we can calculate power for safety outcomes for this 
sample size: there is 81% power to detect treatment differences of 51%, 
assuming  40% of placebo -treated participants experience an AE.  
 
Descri ptive statistics will be derived for all clinical variables, mean and 
standard deviation for continuous outcomes and percentages for categorical 
and dichotomous variables. The main outcome of interest is the mean change 
in digital ulcer net burden at the e nd of [ADDRESS_712610] for baseline 
digital ulcer net burden will be used if the assumptions of the parametric 
ANCOVA model are violated. We will also compare the proportion of 
patients with healing of the cardinal DU, the mean change in number of DUs 
from baseline to week 16, the number of new DUs during the  double blind 
phase of the  study, new ulcers or healing of ulcers over the distal 
interphalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and elbows, and the change in patient - 
reported outcomes (PROs) including Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) measures 
and global assessments by [CONTACT_544859].  
placebo group using similar methods as used for the primary endpoint for 
continuous outcomes and Fisher’s exact tests for discrete outcom es. 
 
The p -values resulting from formal statistical tests will be interpreted from a 
hypothesis -generating, rather than a confirmatory framework.

1. Introduction  
 
1.1 Background  
 
1.1.1 Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)  
 
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, orphan disease featuring chronic, fibrosing, autoimmune 
responses characterized by [CONTACT_104698], autoantibody production, and fibroblast 
dysfunction leading to increased de position of extracellular matrix( 1). 
 
Systemic sclerosis is further divided into 2 subtypes defined by [CONTACT_544860]: 
limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcS Sc). In 
limited disease (formerly called CREST [calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal 
dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias] syndrome), skin tightening is confined to the 
fingers, hands, and forearms distal to the elbows, with or without t ightening of skin of the feet 
and of the legs distal to the knees. Proximal extremities and the trunk are not involved.  In 
dcSSc, the skin of the proximal extremities and trunk is also involved.  Both dcSSc  and lcSSc  are 
associated with internal organ inv olvement; however, patients with dcSSc  are at greater risk for 
clinically significant major organ dysfunction. dcSSc  is one of the most fatal rheumatic diseases, 
and is associated with substantial morbidity and many detrimental effects on health -related 
quality of life.  
 
SSc is an orphan disease with an estimated prevalence of 50,000 in Europe and 276 per 100,000 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US). Applying these estimates to the [ADDRESS_712613] number of patients in the US with SSc is less than 100,000.  Approximately 60% 
have lcSSc  and 35 -40% have dcSSc.  
 
Raynaud’s phenomenon ( RP) is an almost universal manifestation of SSc, with 95% of all 
patients being affected, and resulting in digital ulcers (DUs) in approximately 30% of the 
patients each year. DUs are a major clinical problem, being associated with substantial morbidity 
(reduced quality of life, pain, disability and disfigurement) that can escalate to gangrene and 
amputation in approximately 15% of patients. Treatments that ha ve shown potential include 
calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin analogues and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) .  
Bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is approved in Europe to reduce the number of 
new DUs in patients with SSc. However, b osentan is not approved in [LOCATION_002] and does not 
appear to heal the ulcer. Small studies and case series have shown efficacy of PDE -5 inhibitors 
in scleroderma -spectrum DU and this finding is supported by a meta -analysis( 2). 
 
Riociguat  is the first -in-class of a new group of compounds, soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC) 
stimulators. Riociguat  directly stimulates sGC, thereby [CONTACT_544861]. The cGMP molecule plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_544838], such 
as vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. Two key features of riociguat are ( i) it 
directly stimulates sGC independently of nitric oxide (NO), and (ii) it sensitizes sGC to low 
levels of NO.
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 10 of 56  
Riociguat  has recently been approved in the US and Canada for two forms of pulmonary 
hypertension, namely pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and treatment of chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).  
 
From the literature, there is ample evidence fro m in vitro and in vivo investigations for efficacy 
of cGMP elevation in fibrotic diseases and a large trial is planned in skin fibrosis associated with 
SSc( 3-6). 
 
The goal of the current study is to provide preliminary data o n the efficacy and safety of 16 
weeks of treatment with riociguat in a randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial in patients 
with SSc -associated DU.  
 
1.1.2 Riociguat  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mechanism of Action  
 
As described above, riociguat is the first -in-class sGC stimulator tha t directly stimulates sGC  
independently of NO and sensitizes sGC to low levels of NO. Because of the broad spectrum of 
cGMP actions and specific mode of action of riociguat, the efficacy of sGC  stimulators for the 
treatment of patients with systemic sclero sis (SSc) was investigated.  Both, the vascular effects 
of riociguat  and the direct antifibrotic  effects could be beneficial for the treatment of patients 
with SSc.  More specifically, it was shown that sGC stimulators decrease collagen production in 
derma l fibroblasts from SSc  patients.  In addition, sGC stimulators block fibroblast to 
myofibroblasts  differentiation of dermal fibroblasts. Thus, sGC stimulators could block 
production of collagen and extracellular matrix components, which may explain, at lea st in part, 
the antifibrotic effects of sGC stimulators.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Data  
 
Riociguat  (Adempas) was recently approved in the US and Canada for the treatment of PAH 
and/or CTEPH.  
 
The safety data described below reflect exposure to riociguat  in two, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trials in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST -1) 
and treatment naive or pre -treated PAH patients (PATENT -1). The population ( Riociguat: n = 
490; Placebo: n = 214) was between t he age of 18 and 80 years.  
 
The safety profile of riociguat  in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH 
(CHEST -1) and treatment naive or pre -treated PAH (PATENT -1) were similar. Therefore, 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from the 12 - and 16 -week placebo -controlled trials for 
PAH and CTEPH, respectively, were pooled, and those occurring  more frequently on riociguat 
than placebo (≥3%) are displayed in Table [ADDRESS_712614] adverse reactions in Table 1 can be ascribed to the vasodilatory mechanism of action of 
riociguat. The overall rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_41958] - 
controlled trials were 2.9% for riociguat and 5.1% for placebo (pooled data).

1.2 Rationale of the study  
 
DUs occur in approximately 30% of the patients each year  (2). DUs are a major clinical problem, 
being associated with substantial morbidity (reduced quality of life, pain, disability and 
disfigurement) that can escalate to gangrene and amputation in approximately 15% of patients. 
There are no drugs approved in the  US for treatment of DU. Riociguat is a direct stimulator of 
the sGC in vitro and in vivo which is independent from NO, the endogenous activator of the 
enzyme. Moreover, in the presence of NO, it enhances the effects of NO.  
 
The sGC catalyzes the productio n of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) upon binding of 
NO.  Increased intracellular cGMP levels induce vasorelaxation, inhibition of cell proliferation 
and migration as well as inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation.  
 
Because various preclinic al in vitro and in vivo data revealed that riociguat was safe and 
efficacious in PAH, the hypothesis is that riociguat may bring significant clinical benefit to 
patients with scleroderma by [CONTACT_544862]. In addition, riociguat has anti -fibrotic 
action that may augment the benefits in the vascular pathway.  
 
1.3 Benefit -risk assessment  
 
There are currently no disease -specific pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_544839] a high unmet medical need in this indication. During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_544840] -1 trial for PAH, participants with PAH -SSc were included and the overall benefit -risk 
profile was positive.  
 
Considering the mechanism of action of riociguat and the results of the PAH trials, we believe 
that riociguat will : 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 12 of 56  
 
 Decrease digital ulcer net burden.  
 Heal digital ulcers.  
 Decrease number and severity of Raynaud’s attacks.  
 
Taking into account the seriousness of the disease as well as the medical need for an effective 
and safe therapy, on balance the expected benefit to participants with this life -threatening 
condition outweighs potential risks.  
 
2. Study objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary data on the efficacy (digital ulcer 
net burden) of riociguat administered 3 times daily (TID) in c omparison to placebo in patients 
with SSc.  
 
The primary efficacy outcome is the change from baseline to end of double -blind treatment in 
digital ulcer net burden.  Digital ulcer net burden is defined as the total number of “active” and 
indeterminate digital ulcers  at an assessment . 
 
 
 
2.1 Secondary objectives  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are to provide preliminary data on safety and additional 
measures of efficacy of riociguat administered TID as compared with placebo.  
 
Additional efficacy meas ures include:  
 
 Healing of the cardinal DU. For each participant, one digital ulcer must be identified 
and designated by [CONTACT_544863] . The cardinal ulcer 
must have met the qualifications for designation as an active  or painful indeterminate  
ulcer. If only one ulcer was determined at entry to be active  or painful indeterminate , it 
will be designated as the cardinal ulcer. If several digital ulcers qualified, the cardinal 
ulcer could be either the largest or the most p ainful ulcer, or the ulcer that disturbed the 
patient the most. The cardinal ulcer will be selected by [CONTACT_544864].  
 Development of DU  
 Development and healing of pressure ulcers over the Distal Interphalangeal 
(DIP), Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP), Metacarpophalangeal (MCPs) and 
elbows.  
 Time to healing of cardinal DU  
 Time to healing of all DU  
 Improvement of Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) ( 7, 8) 
o Raynaud’s condition score  
o Number of Raynaud’s attacks/day  
o Patient and physician assessment of RP; pain, numbness, and tingling during an 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 13 of 56  
RP attack; and duration of attacks  
 Patient’s and physician’s global assessment on a Lik ert scale  
 Health -related quality of life (HRQOL) using PROMIS -29 
 Physical function as assessed by [CONTACT_53820] -DI and HDISS -DU 
 Visual analog scales from scleroderma -health assessment questionnaire (SHAQ) 
assessing burden of digital ulcers, Raynaud’s disease, gastro intestinal involvement, 
breathing, and overall disease  
 Digital ischemia requiring intravenous prostacyclin or digital gangrene or amputation  
 Vascular biomarkers in the plasma (VEGF, tPA, sE -Selectin, BFGF, VCAM -1, ICAM)  
 
Safety  outcomes  include  adverse  events,  clinically  significant  changes  in  vital  signs, 
laboratory test abnormalities, and clinical tolerability of the drug.

4.1 Design overview  
 
This clinical trial is a US, multicenter, double -blind, randomized placebo -controlled, parallel - 
group study with a total of 20 participants planned to be randomized (approximately 10 
participants to the riociguat group and 10 to the placebo group). In add ition, a standardized 
wound care protocol (see Appendix 11.2) will be followed by [CONTACT_544865].  
 
The study will allow standard of care medications for the manag ement of DU as background 
therapy. These may include calcium channel blockers, low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], angiotensin enzyme 
inhibitors, etc. and will be determined by [CONTACT_2299]’s local physician.  
 
The study design consists of three phases:  
 
 Screening phase: up to 2 weeks  
 
 Double -blind Treatment phase: 16 weeks of double -blind treatment, consisting of:  
o Dose titration period of up to 8 weeks, and  
o Stable dosing period of up to 8 weeks  
 
 Open -label Extension phase for participants with active  or painful indeterminate  DU at 
the end of the double - blind treatment phase or development of an active  or painful 
indeterminate  DU within a month of completing double -blind phase, consisting of:  
o Dose titration phase of up to 8 weeks  
o Stable dosing period for 8 weeks  
 
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 15 of 56  
 
 
4.1.1 Screening phase (up to 2 weeks)  
 
After providing written informed consent, participants will undergo a screening evaluation to 
determine their eligibility (see Section 7.1 for a detailed schedule of events).  Participants will 
complete a diary detailing the number and duration of Raynaud’s attacks per day for a period of 
at least 7 consecutive days leading up to the start of treatment / Day 0.  
If the Raynaud’s attack diary can be completed prior to the screenin g visit  it will allow the 
patient with a painful ulcer to be screened and randomized the same day thereby [CONTACT_544866].   
 
4.1.2 Double -blind Treatment phase (Week 0 to Week 16)  
 
At the baseline visit, participants who hav e met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to riociguat or placebo using a web -based 
randomization system.  
 
Dose titration phase (Visits 1 to 5)  
 
In the first 8 weeks of the double -blind treatment phase,  participants will undergo individual 
dose titration.  
 
The starting dosage is 1.0 mg TID.  The dose should be increased by 0.5 mg increments no 
sooner than 2 weeks(± 4 days) apart to 1.5 mg, 2 mg and 2.5 mg TID, resulting in a maximum 
total daily dose of 7 .5 mg  (2.5 mg TID) .  Participants can be maintained on a lower dose if 
higher doses are not tolerated (minimum dosage of 0.5 mg TID, total daily dose 1.5 mg).  It is 
possible for a participant to be up -titrated and then down -titrated during the course of t his phase 
of the study.  

 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 16 of 56  
 
However, once a participant has been down -titrated, they will remain at that dose and escalation 
will not be implemented again.   If necessary, a participant can down -titrate multiple times to  a 
minimum of 0.5 mg TID.  
 
To maintain b linding of the treatment arms, participants randomized to the placebo group will 
undergo sham titration from Visit 1 onwards during the dose -titration period following the rules 
of the individual dose titration scheme.  
 
Individual dose titration algorithm  
 
The individual study medication dose for the next titration step will be determined every 2 weeks 
according to the patient’s well -being and the peripheral systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured 
at trough before intake of the morning dose according to the following algorithm (individual 
dose titration scheme):  
 
 If SBP is ≥ 95 mmHg and the participant has no signs or symptoms of hypotension , the 
dosage should be increased by 0.5 mg TID.  If the participant has signs or symptoms of 
hypotension, the dose should  be decreased by 0.5 mg TID, regardless of SBP.  
 If SBP is < 95 mmHg, the dosage should be maintained provided the participant does not  
show any signs or symptoms of hypotension . 
 If SBP is < 95 mmHg and the participant exhibits signs or symptoms of hypotens ion the 
current dosage should be decreased by 0.5 mg TID.  
 If the participant develops SBP < 95 mmHg or exhibits signs or symptoms of 
hypotension on 0.5 mg TID, then the participant is discontinued from study medication 
but should  continue with follow -up visits. The participant may continue in  the open label 
phase at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_544843] 16 or week 20 .   
 
Stable dosing period (Visits  6, and 7)  
 
The overall duration of the double -blind treatment phase is 16 weeks, including the dose titration 
period.  At the end of the dose titration period (Week 8/Visit 5), the participant’s stable dose for 
the next 8 weeks will be determined using the treatment algorithm above.  No further increase in 
dose will be allowed.  The established individual dose will then be taken as the “optimal 
individual dose” to be administered for the remaining duration of the main study (up to  Week 
16). 
 
Dose reductions for safety reasons (e.g., in case of any treatment -emergent adverse event [AE]) 
are allowed, but a subsequent dose increase during the maintenance period is not permitted.  
 
Dose Interruptions  
 
If treatment is interrupted  between visits  for any reason other than signs and symptoms of 
hypotension, the following rules should be applied:  
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 17 of 56  
 ≤ 3 consecutive days without treatment:  restart with last dose  
 > 3 days but ≤ [ADDRESS_712621] igator whether the study medication can be restarted : if  restarted, start with last 
dose 
 > 14 consecutive days without treatment:  withdraw the participant from study 
medication (but continue follow -up in the study).  
 
The algorithm below will be followed for dose titration at study visit s 2-5 and OL Visits 9 -12 if 
treatment is interrupted for any length of time:

4.1.3 Open -Label Extension phase (OLE)  
 
At Visit 7 (Week 16), all participants with active  or painful indeterminate DU will be offered the 
opportunity to initiate active treatment with riociguat, as part of the open -label phase.  
 
At Visit 7 (Week 16), participants without an active or painful indeterminate  DU will stop 
double -blind therapy and be scheduled for a Safety Follow -up at Week 20. Those who have a 
reoccurrence of  DU prior to and including their scheduled Week 20 visit (i.e., the 4 week period 
after the end of the double - blind period), will be offered open -label riociguat.  Those who do not 
develop an active DU by [CONTACT_10585] 20 will terminate the study at the Week 20 vi sit. 
 
 
 All participants who agree to remain in the study for the OLE, regardless of their original 
randomized treatment, will receive riociguat  for an additional 16 weeks  according to the 
dose-titration and stable dosing regimen that was used in the double  blind phase, starting 
with 1.0 mg riociguat .   
 
Figure 7.1 provides a flow diagram of the end of double -blind to either end -of-study or start of 
open -label extension phases of the study.  
 
Dose Titration Phase (Visits 7 to 12)  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 18 of 56  
 
At Visit 7 (Week 16), all pa rticipants who agree to continue in the open -label extension will be 
assigned to treatment with riociguat. During the first 8 weeks of the open -label extension phase, 
participants previously on placebo will be up -titrated on riociguat according to the indi vidual 
titration algorithm described above in the double -blind treatment phase. Participants randomized 
to riociguat in the double -blind study treatment phase will also undergo  titration (to protect the 
blind of the double -blind portion of the study).  
 
Stable dosing period (Visits 13 and 14)  
 
Stable dosing will continue for another 8 weeks.  
 
4.1.4 Early Termination Visit and Safety Follow -up Visit  
 
A termination visit and a safety follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_712622] dose of study medication) 
should be performed for all patients who withdraw from study at any time during the double 
blind phase.  A termination visit should be performed for anyone who withdrawals early during 
the OLE.   If there are no study medication related Adverse events nor any digitial ulcers t he 
follow -up visit can be performed as a phone call to alleviate the participant’s burden  of an in 
person clinic visit.

5.1.3 Justification of selection criteria  
 
The selection criteria were carefully selected to exclude participants from the study who may 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version [ADDRESS_712626] be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
 At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative  
At any time during the study and without giving reasons, a participant may decline to 
participate further.  The participant will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
 If, in the in vestigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the study would be harmful to the 
participant's well -being  
 Occurrence of AEs or intercurrent diseases which the investigator judges unacceptable 
for continuation of participation in the study  
 Occurrence of adverse drug  reactions, which in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_18218] a negative 
impact on the participant’s individual risk -benefit ratio.  (Investigators are obliged to 
reassess the participant’s individual risk -benefit ratio on a continuous basis. Factors such 
as antici pated treatment effect, progression of underlying disease, occurrence of side 
effects, and alternative treatment options must be considered.)  
 Non-compliance with the conditions for the trial or instructions by [CONTACT_544869] . 
 Although not preferred, participants may interrupt their intake of study medication for 
reasonable circumstances/reasons at any time (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51531] a remote hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104684], safety reasons, and side effects).  If an inte rruption lasts 
longer than [ADDRESS_712627]  the opportunity to participate in 
OLE if s/he meets the criteria.  In case treatment requires in terruption for > 3 days and ≤ 
14 days, it is at the discretion of the investigator if the study medication can be restarted.  
 In case of pregnancy or breast feeding.  
 In case a female patient of childbearing potential is not compliant with 4 -weekly 
pregnancy  testing.  
 Participation in another clinical trial.  Participation in observational registries is allowed.  
 In case no further dose reduction is possible and the participant does not tolerate the 
lowest possible riociguat dose (0.5 mg TID).  
 
Participants may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
 At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator (e.g., safety 
concerns).  
 Development of DU complications requiring prostacyclin therapy, gangrene, or 
amputation.  
 
Escape t herapy  
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version [ADDRESS_712628] of care.  
 
All reasons for withdrawal (in cluding lost to follow up), will be recorded in the eCRF and site 
medical record.  
 
In the event that a participant is lost to follow -up, every possible effort must be made by [CONTACT_544870].  
 
A participant may withdraw from further participation in the study and still allow further release 
of information. In this situation, the participant’s consent to the collection of further data should 
be documented in the site’s source documents.

The individual optimal dose should be determined during the initial 8 -week dose titration period 
based on monitoring of the participant’s systolic blood pressure and well -being.  
 
The starting dose is 1.0 mg TID. The intervals between drug intake should be 6-8 hours.  The 
dosage should be increased by 0.5 mg increments no sooner than 2 weeks apart to 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 
and 2.5 mg TID, resulting in a maximum total daily dose of 7.5 mg  (2.5 mg TID) .  Participants 
should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated (minimum dose of 0.5 mg 
TID.).  If the participant cannot tolerate 0.5 mg po TID, then the participant is discontinued (see 
section  5.2.1 ). After the dose titration period, riociguat should be continued at the optimal 
individual dose for the duration of the stable dosing period.

Storage requirements:  
 
All investigational drugs used during the trial will be stored at the investigational sites at room 
temperature in a place inaccessible to unauthorized personnel, i.e. in a locked cabinet.  
No special storage conditions are required.  
 
6.3 Treatment assignment  
 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study. 
Participants who complete all screening procedures and meet all the eligibility criteria are to be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either riociguat or placebo. The randomization schedule will 
be prepared by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC)  using a computer -generated block 
randomization with the block size(s) known only by [CONTACT_544871]  
 
6.4 Dosage and administration  
 
6.4.1  Selection of doses in the study  
 
Riociguat has been safe and well tolerated in previou s clinical studies at multiple doses between  
0.5 and 2.5 mg TID in patients with various forms of PH, including PAH, CTEPH, and, in a 
small patient population, SSc -related PH. The starting dose for this study will be at 1.0 mg PO 
TID.  
 
6.4.2  Special popula tions  
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 26 of 56  
Riociguat has not been studied in all populations. Particular care should be exercised when 
dosing the following:  
 
Elderly  
 
In elderly patients (≥65 years) particular care should be exercised during individual dose titration 
as this population showed a higher exposure.  
 
Renal impairment  
 
Patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 -80 mL/min) 
showed a higher exposure to riociguat. Patients with creatinine clearance <15 mL/min or on 
dialysis have not been studied. Therefore, the use of riociguat is not recommended in these 
patients who are consequently excluded from the study.  
 
Hepatic impairment  
 
Patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh B) showed a higher exposure to 
riociguat. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C) have not been studied 
(Appendix 11.1). Therefore, the use of riociguat is not recommended in these patients who are 
consequently excluded from the study.  
 
Smokers  
 
Plasma concentration s in smokers are reduced by 50 -60% compared to nonsmokers. Safety and 
effectiveness of riociguat doses higher than 2.[ADDRESS_712633] two wee ks prior 
to screening may be considered as a “non -smoker.  
 
6.5 Blinding  
 
The study will be conducted in double -blind fashion.  Active riociguat and placebo tablet 
formulations will be identical in appearance (size, shape, color) and smell.  The packaging and 
labeling will be designed to maintain blinded conditions for the investigator’s team and the 
participants. The study data will remain blinded until database lock and authorization of data 
release according to standard operating procedures.  
 
Unblinding by d rug safety personnel of the sponsor  
 
For regulatory reporting purposes, drug safety personnel of the sponsor are permitted to unblind 
individual cases.  
 
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a suspected unexpected serious 
adverse react ion (S[LOCATION_003]R) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), the participant’s treatment code will usually be 
unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, Independent Ethics Committees / 
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and investigators (s ee Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) if the S[LOCATION_003]R was 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version [ADDRESS_712634] received 
riociguat  if the pregnancy is confirmed . 
 
Drug logistics and accountability  
 
All study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance w ith Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and GMP requirements and the instructions given by [CONTACT_544872], and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  Special storage 
conditions and a complete record of batch numbers and expi[INVESTIGATOR_544846]; the site -relevant elements of this information will be available in the investigator site 
file. The responsible site personnel will confirm receipt of study drug and will use the study drug 
only within t he framework of this clinical study and in accordance with this protocol. Receipt, 
distribution, return and destruction (if any) of the study drug must be properly documented 
according to the sponsor’s agreed and specified procedures.  
 
Written instructions  on medication destruction will be made available to affected parties as 
applicable.  
 
6.6 Treatment compliance  
 
A drug dispensing log will be completed for each participant. The date of dispensing the study 
drug to the participant will be documented.  
 
Participants will receive study medication dispensed per visit schedule (see Section 7.1). 
 
To record treatment compliance, participants will be instructed to bring all study drug packaging, 
including unused study drug and emp ty packaging, to the investigative site at each study visit.  
Tablets will be counted for a compliance check.  
 
If a dose of study drug is missed, the participant should take a dose immediately and continue 
with the TID intake as recommended on the following  day. The dose should not be doubled to 
make up for a missed dose within the same day.  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 28 of 56  
 
Participants should not take study drug the day of their clinic visit at the end of the double -blind 
period of the study (Visit 7/Week16).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_712635]-study therapy  
 
In case participants permanently discontinue study drug treatment during this study, further 
therapy is at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.8 Prior and concomitant therapy  
 
A summary of the prohibited prior and concomitant therapy, outlined in the exclusion crit eria 
(Section 5.1.2 ), is provided in Table 6 -1.

with study  drug 
 
In addition, caution is advised during the intake of any of the following concomitant 
medications:  
 
 The concomitant use of riociguat  with strong multi -pathway cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 
P-glycoprotein 1 (P -gp)/breast cancer resistance protein inhibitors such as azole 
antimycotics  (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) or human immunodeficiency virus 
protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) is not recommended, due to the pronounced increase 
in riociguat exposure.  
 The concomitant use of riociguat  with strong CYP1A1 (CYP family 1, subfamily A, 
polypeptide 1) inhibitors, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, and strong P -gp 
inhibitors, such as the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A, may increase riociguat 
exposure (see section ‘interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction’). These drugs should be used with caution.  Blood pressure should be 
monitored and dose reduction of riociguat  considered.  
 
Other medications considerations  
 
 Pre- and concomitant treatment with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once 
daily) reduced riociguat mean area under the plasma concentration versus time curve 
(AUC) by 26% and mean maximum plasma concentration (C max) by 35%.  This is not 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 29 of 56  
considered  clinically relevant.  
 Co-administration of the antacid aluminum hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide reduced 
riociguat  mean  AUC by 34% and mean C max by 56%. Antacids should be taken at least 
1 hour after riociguat.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Visits 2 through 7 – Dose titration/Stable dosing periods (Double -blind 
treatment phase)  
 
At these study visits, the participant should attend the clinic without having taken the morning 
dose of study medication.  
 
During the dose titration period and stable dosing periods of the double -blind treatment phase 
(Visits 2 to 7), the following assessments will be performed according to the schedule of events 
(Section 7.1.1):  
 
 Physical examination at Visits 3 and 7, including weight  
 Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) at every visit.  Blood pressure and heart rate 
will be measured at all visits in a sitting position after the participant has been at rest fo r 
at least 5 minutes.  The same arm is always used for these measurements  
 Discuss adherence with the local wound care at every visit  
 Take digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_544848] 7  
 Digital ulcer assessment at all visits  
 Recording and assessment of AEs  at all visits  
 Pregnancy test (urine) for all women of childbearing potential at Visits 3, 5, 6, and 7  
 A standard [ADDRESS_712640] 5 minutes at Visits 5 and 7  
 Hematology and  serum chemistry at Visits 5 and 7  
 Patient reported outcomes (patient global assessment, PROMIS -29, HAQ - DI/SHAQ  and 
HDISS -DU) and physician global assessment at Visit 7.  
 Assessment of Raynaud’s attacks – participant to be provided 1 -week diary at Visit 6 and 
returned on Visit 7. Since the diary is only for 1 week, participant can do it for one  
continuous week between the 2 visits and bring it back at Visit 7.  
 Concomitant therapy at all visits  
 Dispensation of study drug (At Visit 7 if participant has active  or painful indeterminate  
DU, Open Label drug will be dispensed if participant consents to continued participation 
in the study.)** Important note: Participants should not take the last dose of randomized 
drug the night prior to coming to the clinic for vi sit 7.  
 Blood plasma sample for biomarkers to be obtained before the start of study drug

treatment (see Section 7.6.3 ) at Visit 7  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Early Termination Visit during Double Blind  
 
In the case of an early termination/withdrawal during double -blind period, follow the schedule of 
events for Visit 7. The only exception is that Raynaud’s diary is not collected if it was not 
dispensed at least 1 week prior to early termination visit.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unscheduled visit  
 
Participants can be brought into the clinic for an unscheduled (UNSCH) visit should they 
experience dose toleration issues or other treatment related adverse events in between their 
regularly -scheduled visits.  
 
During an UNS CH visit, vitals , physical exam, and assessment for AE’s should occur. Should a 
dose reduction be warranted the participant should return the previously dispensed medication 
bottles .  The site can then dispense a lower dose through the drug dispensing system.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit  8 Sa fety Follow -up for double -blind period or start of Open -label  
 
If the participant does not qualify for or chooses not to participate in the open -label phase of the 
study at visit 7, they will return in 4 weeks for visit 8 which is intended to be a Safety Follow -up 
visit.  However, if at this time (visit 8), they have a DU and choose to enter the open -label phase, 
this visit is considered to be the start of the Open -Label phase (OLE Week 0) and they can 
receive study medication at this visit.  If at this ti me (visit 8), they don’t have DU, then this visit 
is the Week 20 Safety Follow -up (Visit 8) .  If a participant does not have any adverse events  that 
are attributable to the study medication [as assessed by [CONTACT_099]]  the week 20 safety follow -
up can be  performed over the phone , if the participant chooses , in order to minimize their 
burden.

Pharmacokinetic s will not be performed in this study.  
 
7.5 Safety  
 
7.5.1 Adverse events  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
 
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
 
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings],  symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigatio nal) product.  
 
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_544874] (however, the condition for which the surgery is 
required may be an AE).  
 
In the following different iation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may 
include abnormal physical examination findings, symptoms, diseases, laboratory results, and 
ECG findings.  
 
 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms  or 
treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical history 
(e.g., seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history (e.g., allergic pollinosis).  
 Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as AEs. 
 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version [ADDRESS_712642] medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a – f): 
 
a. Results in death  
 
b. Is life -threatening  
 
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the participant  
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544849]:  
 
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours  
- The admission is pre -planned  
(i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study)  
- The admission is not associated with an AE  
(e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).  
 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471426] ‘medically importan t’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities 
specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
 
d. Results in persistent or significant disab ility / incapacity  
 
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
 
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
 
f. Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classifications for  adverse event assessment  
 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_336456].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_712643] be determined according to the criteria given in Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] . 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 39 of 56  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Severity  
 
The severity  of an AE is classified according to the following categories:  
- Grade 1 Mild  
- Grade 2 Moderate  
- Grade 3 Severe  
- Grade 4 Very Severe  
- Grade 5 Death   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Causal relationship  
 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a 
clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF.  
 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “r easonable causal relationship” to 
the study treatment in question.  
 
Possible answers are “ Related ” or “ Not Related ” An assessment of “ Not Related ” would include:  
 
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g., mechanical bleeding at surgical site.  
 
or 
 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g., the participant is struck by [CONTACT_23634]; cancer 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration.  
 
An assessment of “ Related ” indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_544850].  
 
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment 
include:  
 
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  
The event should occur after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re -introduction (r e- 
challenge):  
Participant’s response after de -challenge or participants response after re -challenge 
should be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in 
question.  
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:  
Each event should b e evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of 
the disease being treated and any other disease the participant may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 40 of 56  
The other drugs the participant is taking or the treatment the participant receiv es 
should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause 
the event in question.  
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion) of the  study treatment, coupled with the individual participant’s 
pharmacodynamics should be considered.  
 
Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)  
 
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is  based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).  
 
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action taken with study treatment  
 
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using  the categories listed 
below.  
 
- Drug withdrawn  
- Drug interrupted  
- Dose reduced  
- Dose not changed  
- Not applicable  
- Unknown  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events  
 
- None  
- Remedial drug therapy  
- Other  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].6  Outcome  
 
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
 
- Recovered/resolved  without sequelae  
- Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not resolved  (ongoing)  
- Fatal  
- Unknown  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments and documentation of adverse events  
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 41 of 56  
The investigator has the obligation to report AEs. All non -serious events will be assessed and 
recorded during the specified observational phase (from signing the informed consent form up to 
30 [+5] days after last study medication intake), whether believe d to be related or unrelated to 
the treatment. AE forms will be included in the eCRFs. The record will include clinical 
symptoms or final diagnosis when available, date of appearance, duration, severity and 
relationship to treatment. A record will also be kept of the action taken and the follow -up until 
resolution of the AE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of serious adverse events  
 
Reporting of SAEs to the FDA  
 
The sponsor -investigator will report serious adverse event to the FDA according to the 
regulations found at 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
Notification of the IECs / IRBs  
 
Notification of the IECs / IRBs about all relevant events (e.g., SAEs, suspected, unexpected, 
serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]) will be performed by [CONTACT_8975].  
 
Spon sor’s notification of the investigational site  
 
The sponsor will inform all investigational sites about reported relevant events (e.g., S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
according to all applicable regulations.  
 
Sponsor Investigator reporting to Bayer  
 
All serious adverse events  should be reported to the DCC who is responsible for reporting  all 
serious adverse events that are unexpected and related to study medication  to Bayer, the 
manufacturer of riociguat, within 24 hours.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adverse events  
 
For this study, the applicable  reference document is the most current version of the package 
insert.  
 
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_544875].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events of special safety inter est 
 
Symptomatic hypotension and serious hemoptysis have been defined as AEs of special interest 
and must be documented accordingly in the corresponding AE eCRF.  Events of symptomatic 
hypotension and non -serious hemoptysis should not automatically be upgr aded by [CONTACT_544876].  Declaration of an event as serious should only occur when 1 or more of 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 42 of 56  
the serious criteria (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) are applicable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose of Study Medication  
 
In cas e of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required.  In case of 
pronounced hypotension, active cardiovascular support may be required.  If symptoms develop 
after the investigational drug has been administered, any therapy that become s necessary has to 
be guided by [CONTACT_544877]. Participants must remain under medical supervision 
until all relevant adverse effects have resolved in the event of overdose; participant continuation 
remains at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_712644] report to the sponsor any pregnancy occurring in a study participant during 
the participant’s participation in this study.  The report should be submitted  within the same 
timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE.  Any pregnancies 
should be reported to the DCC who is responsible for reporting to Bayer, the manufacturer of 
riociguat.  
 
For a study participant, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any 
outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.  
 
 

 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 43 of 56  
 
 
7.6 Other procedures and variables  
 
7.6.1 Pregnancy testing  
 
Pregnancy testing is to be performed at the Screening Visit, Visit 1 (Day 0; urine) and in 4 - 
weekly intervals thereafter (urine) until one month after the participant stops intake of study 
drug. The results are to be documented in the eCRF and in the pati ent file. 
 
In the event of pregnancy,  study medication must be stopped and  a referral to a gynecologist for 
confirmation of pregnancy must be organized as soon as possible.  In addition, the pregnancy 
must be reported to the sponsor as described in Section  7.5.[ADDRESS_712645] the si te 
immediately to discuss further steps (e.g., exclusion of pregnancy by [CONTACT_142668]).  
 
Women of childbearing potential and non -vasectomized male participants must agree to use 
adequate contraception when sexually active.  
 
‘Adequate contraception’  is defined as any combination of at least [ADDRESS_712646] one is a physical barrier (e.g., condoms with hormonal contraception or 
implants or combined oral contraceptives, certain intrauterine devices).  
 
7.6.2 Laboratory parameters  
 
The laboratory parameters will be analyzed in a local laboratory  and reported on the eCRF . 
 
7.6.3 Exploratory Biomarkers  
 
Exploratory vascular biomarkers will be evaluated at Visit 1 (Day 0) and Visit 7 (Week 16). 
Plasma for determination of VEGF, tPA, sE -Selectin, BFGF, VCAM -1, and ICAM will be 
collected and shipped to the University of Michigan laboratory. Details on collection, processing 
and storage are described in the Manual of Operations.  
 
7.6.[ADDRESS_712647] for 5 minutes. The same arm is always used for these measurements.  
 
Methodology:  Noninvasive measurement preferably with a validated electronic  device in 
accordance with published guidelines (e.g., American Heart Association Recommendations for 
Blood Pressure Measurement in Humans and Experimental Animals).  
 
7.6.5 Digital ulcer net burden  
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 44 of 56  
Digital ulcers are defined as a full thickness skin lesion with  loss of epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. Ulcers should be 
> 3mm in maximal diameter. Healing is defined by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_544851]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_544852]. Also, eschar is not 
considered as a DU.  
 
Digital ulcer net burden will be assessed by [CONTACT_51856]:  
 
 Ulcer count – Ulcer assessment  will ideally be performed by [CONTACT_544878]:  
o Total ulcer counts distal to MCP joint (this can include both distal ulcer [defined 
as distal to PIP joint] and proximal ulcer [defined between MCP and PIP joint}  
o Distal (fingertip) ulcer counts:  any ulcer including skin area distal to proximal 
interphalangeal (PIP) joint  
 Ulcer net burden: Ulcer net burden is defined as the total number of “active” or 
indeterminate digital ulcers at that assessment .  Any ulcer from the  Metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP) joint to distal phalanges on the dorsal and palmar (volar) surface of the hand, 
(including the digital tip) and the elbows will be  assessed.  
 Visual analog sco re for patient -reported severity of digital ulcers as part of the SHAQ 
(see section 7.6.8 ) 
 Non-ischemic ulcers over the dorsum of DIP, PIP, MCP and over elbows will also be 
evaluated for healing as secondary outcomes  
 
7.6.[ADDRESS_712648] the same digit.  
 
Gangrene is defined as diffuse necrosis (pathologic death of deeper, e.g. subcutaneous, 
structures) due to obstruction, loss,  or diminution of blood supply; it is of black color and 
painful, and may be localized to parts of the finger or involve an entire finger. It may be wet or 
dry, reflecting a degree of adjacent tissue perfusion, time course of necrosis and presence or type 
of associated secondary infection.  
 
7.6.7 Raynaud’s attacks assessment  
 
Raynaud’s attacks will be assessed using the composite of the following 6 individual outcome 
measures in order to minimize the measurement variability and placebo response( 7): Raynaud’s 
condition score, patient assessment of Raynaud’s phenomenon, physician assessment of 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, attack symptoms, duration of attacks, and number of attacks per day.  
 
The Raynaud’s condition score is a daily patient assessment of Raynaud’s phenomenon activity 
using a [ADDRESS_712649] of Raynaud’s phenomenon attacks, reflecting the overall degree that Raynaud’s has 
affected use of the participan t’s hands. The Raynaud’s condition score, along with details of the 
frequency and duration of Raynaud’s attacks, will be incorporated into the daily diary that 
participants will be asked to complete for 1 week (7 days) at the time points shown below.  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 45 of 56  
 
The patient and physician assessment assesses the severity of Raynaud’s phenomenon in the past 
week using a 0 -100 VAS.  
 
Frequency: Daily diary to be completed by [CONTACT_462746] 7 consecutive days prior to study visits 
at Screening and Week 12.  
 
7.6.8 Patient -Report ed Outcomes (PROs) / Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
questionnaires  
 
Three patient -reported outcomes (PROs) —the HAQ -DI/SHAQ , HDISS -DU and PROMIS -29—
will be completed by [CONTACT_544879].  
 
Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ -DI/SHAQ)  
 
The HAQ -DI consists of [ADDRESS_712650] week.   It additionally measures 
5 domains specific to scleroderma using a continuous VAS:  Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital tip 
ulcers, lung symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a global patient assessment.  The VAS 
subscales of the SHAQ were shown to be signi ficantly correlated with objective parameters and 
were responsive to change in a cohort and in a Raynaud’s phenomenon trial in SSc. The SHAQ 
requires approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
 
Hand Disability in Systemic Schlerosis -DU (HDISS -DU™)  
 
The HDISS -DU™ was developed in accordance with the 2009 guidance from the US Food and 
Drug Administration.The concepts and items comprising the HDISS -DU were developed based 
on an initial phase of interviews of digital ulcer (DU) patients that included con cept elicitation 
and cognitive debriefing on the Cochin Hand Function Scale (an 18 -item functional disability 
questionnaire that uses tasks of daily living to assess function), and a second phase of patient 
cognitive debriefing interviews on a revised inst rument. Results from the cognitive debriefing 
interviews suggest that the draft HDISS -DU is a comprehensive measure assessing the impact of 
DUs on hand functioning that asks patients to rate their ability to complete common activities 
over the past 7 days.  The psychometric evaluation, including final validation of the HDISS -DU 
and derivation of a scoring algorithm, is under development based on blinded data from the 
DUAL studies.  The HDISS -DU requires approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
 
Patient -Reported O utcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) -29 
 
The PROMIS -29 is a validated instrument to measure the health status of SSc patients, 
demonstrating moderate to high correlation with other instruments validated in SSc, including 
the SF -36 physical compo nent score and HAQ -DI. It incorporates 7 core domains from the 
PROMIS questionnaire, which specifically relate to physical, mental, and social health aspects of 
chronic illness:  pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep, and physical function, as well as one 
11-point rating scale for pain intensity.  It contains 8 items with 29 weighted responses in total, 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 46 of 56  
and requires approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
 
7.6.9 Participant and Physician Global Assessment  
 
A global assessment for patient and physician will be obtained.  
 
The participant assessment represents the patient’s assessment of the patient’s global 
scleroderma on a 0 -10 Likert scale. “On a scale of [ADDRESS_712651] 
week? 0=Excellent; 10=Extremely Poor.  The physician global a ssessment represents the 
physician’s assessment of the patient’s current disease activity on a 0 -10 Likert scale. “On a 
scale of 0 -10, how was your patient’s overall health in the last week? 0=Excellent; 10=Extremely 
Poor”. Both assessments are made at bas eline and Week 16, OLE Week 0 and OLE Week 16.  
 
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
 
8.1 General considerations  
 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses.  A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) will be written for the study that contains detailed descriptions of the analyses to be 
performed.  The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the data.  
 
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics including n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, rang e (e.g., minimum and maximum). Qualitative variables will be 
summarized using counts and percentages. Summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_14459].  Graphical methods will be heavily used in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_544853] o ver time for key variables and to assess the relationships among variables. For most 
outcomes, separate analyses will be performed for the double -blind and open -label extension 
treatment periods.  
 
Unless otherwise specified, statistical analyses will be pe rformed using SAS Version 9 or higher.  
Where appropriate, statistical tests will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level (with no 
adjustments for multiplicity) using two -tailed tests and p -values will be reported.  
 
Given the rare nature of SSc and the consequent small sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_544854], 
the statistical power of any comparisons is limited (i.e., there is sufficient power to detect only 
large treatment differences). As such the analysis will be  largely descriptive in nature as the 
study is not powered to determine a statistical difference between riociguat vs. placebo.  The p -
values resulting from formal statistical tests will be interpreted from a hypothesis -generating, 
rather than a confirmato ry framework.  
 
8.2 Analysis sets  
 
The main population for efficacy will be the modified intention -to-treat population (MITT), 
defined as all participants randomized, receiving at least one dose of treatment, and having at 
least one post -baseline efficacy asses sment. Participants will be analyzed by [CONTACT_220261].   
The primary endpoint and all secondary outcomes will be assessed using this analysis set.  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 47 of 56  
 
The Per Protocol population (PP) will consist of all participants in the MITT population who did 
not ha ve a major protocol violation, inclusive of violation of entry criteria. Participants in this 
population will be referenced as evaluable.  Only the primary endpoint will be assessed using 
this analysis set (sensitivity analysis).  
 
The Safety Population is defined as all participants who were randomized and received at least 
one dose of the study drug. The Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses. 
Participants will be analyzed by [CONTACT_82153]. If participants inadvertently receive both 
active drug and placebo, they will be included in the riociguat group.  
 
Membership in the analysis populations will be determined before study unblinding.  
 
8.3 Statistical and analytical plans  
 
8.3.1 Demographic and other baseline characteristics  
 
Demographic variables and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
8.3.2 Efficacy  
 
The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline to end of the double -blind study 
treatment phase (Week 16) in the digital ulcer net burden. For the primary analysis, changes in 
digital ulcer net burden will be compared in the two treatment groups using an ANCOVA model 
with terms for treatment group and baseline digital ulcer net burden value. If the assumptions of 
this parametric model are not met, an alterna tive non -parametric model will be used. This model 
is based on the extension of the Wilcoxon rank -sum test to allow for covariate adjustment (9). 
This rank ANCOVA can provide additional power associated with baseline covariate adjustment, 
even when the out come variable is not normally distributed 1(10).  
 
Analysis for secondary outcome measures that are continuous will be performed using a similar 
approach as that for the primary endpoint. We will compare the change in each secondary 
outcome measure from bas eline to week 16 between the two treatment groups  
using an ANCOVA model or its non -parametric counterpart if the model assumptions aren’t met.  
Analyses of secondary outcomes measures that are discrete will be performed using Fisher’s 
exact tests. Analyses  of secondary outcome measure that are counts will be performed using 
Poisson regression.  
 
8.3.3 Safety  
 
Descriptive summary statistics for treatment -emergent adverse and serious adverse events will be 
reported. Adverse events will be grouped by [CONTACT_544880]; serious adverse events will be enumerated and described as 
appropriate. The total number of adverse events of each grade occurring in the two treatment 
groups by [CONTACT_10585] 16 will be compared using a Fishe r’s exact test. Poisson regression or 
comparable non -parametric methods will be used to compare the total number of serious adverse 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 48 of 56  
events during the double -blind 16 -week period and (separately) during the open -label extension 
16-week period, by [CONTACT_1570]. Similar analyses will be conducted for treatment -emergent 
AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and of special safety interest.  
 
The other safety outcomes will be presented with descriptive statistics.  
 
The safety evaluation of labor atory data will include:  
 
 Incidence rates of treatment -emergent laboratory values outside of normal range.  
 Incidence rates of pre -specified laboratory data abnormalities.  
 Descriptive analysis of continuous laboratory parameters, and their changes from 
baseline by [CONTACT_6982].  
 
Descriptive analysis of vital signs, and their changes from baseline, will be performed by 
[CONTACT_6982].  
For ECGs, the status pre -treatment and post -treatment will be tabulated.  The incidence rates of 
treatment -emergent ECG abnormalities will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  A descriptive 
analysis of continuous ECG parameters and their changes from baseline by [CONTACT_544881].  
 
8.4 Planned interim analyses  
 
No formal interim  analysis of the double -blind treatment phase is planned.  
 
8.5 Determination of sample size  
 
SSc is a rare disease. The planned sample size of 20 SSc participants is based on practical 
considerations to obtain preliminary estimates of the magnitude of treatmen t differences in 
efficacy and safety rather than a desired power for a pre -specified difference as would be 
necessary for a confirmatory study. However, with this proposed sample of 20 participants (10 
riociguat and 10 placebo), we can calculate the magnit ude of treatment differences (riociguat – 
placebo) for the primary efficacy endpoint – the change from baseline to end of double -blind 
treatment in digital ulcer net burden (a continuous endpoint), or safety outcomes  – characterized 
by [CONTACT_544882].  There would be 80% power to detect an 
effect size (mean treatment difference divided by [CONTACT_157516]) of  1.253 or greater with a 
two-sided type I error of 5% in the primary endpoint, based on a two - sample t test.  G iven the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_544855], the difference between mean change in digital ulcer net 
burden between riociguat and placebo that can be detected with sufficient power is large.  
Similarly, we can calculate power for safety outcomes for this  sample size:  there is 81% power 
to detect treatment differences of 51%, assuming 40% of placebo -treated participants experience 
an AE based on a two -sample binomial test.

are readily available upon authorities’ request.  
 
Participant (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with 
the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private practice. Where the 
archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required by [CONTACT_456],  alternative 
arrangements must be made to ensure the availability of the source documents for the required 
period.  
 
The investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change (eg, 
relocation or transfer of ownership).  
 
The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval.  
 
The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the study 
center.  
 
9. Premature termination of the study  
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 50 of 56  
 
The sponsor ([CONTACT_203512]) has th e right to close this study (or, if applicable, individual segments 
thereof [e.g., treatment arms; dose steps; centers]) at any time, which may be due but not limited 
to the following reasons:  
 
 If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for examp le, 
- Safety findings from this study (e.g., SAEs)  
- Results of any interim analysis  
- Results of parallel clinical studies  
- Results of parallel animal studies (e.g., toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity or 
reproduction toxicity).  
 If the study conduct (e.g.,  recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time 
frame.  
 
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at any time.  
 
For any of the above closures, the following applies:  
 
 Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.  
 All affected institutions (e.g., IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority ( -ies); study center; 
head of study center) m ust be informed as applicable according to local law.  
 All study materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be 
returned to the sponsor.  The investigator will retain all other documents until notification 
given by [CONTACT_544883] r destruction.  
 In case of a partial study closure, ongoing participants, including those in post study 
follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
 
Details for individual participant's withdrawal can be found in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_712655], evaluation, and documentation 
of this study, are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator abide by [CONTACT_544884].  The study will also be 
carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and regulation(s).  
 
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is  required for all aspects of study 
conduct; the investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in this protocol.

11.2 Digital Ulcer Care Protocol  
 
Digital Ulcer Care protocol:  
 
Active ulcers:  
 
Clean the ulcer once daily. This can be done by [CONTACT_544886] (this can be bought from any drug store).   Allow the ulcer to air -dry or pat -dry using a 
sterile gauze.  
 
Apply vitamin E oil once daily. This should be done by [CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_544857]. The gauze will then be placed over the ulcer, and secured by [CONTACT_5640] 3M™ Coban  
(sold as breathable gentle tape), absolute water proof tape (sold by [CONTACT_544887]) or a 
Band -Aid. 
 
 
 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version [ADDRESS_712656] once daily.  If the ulcer appears macerated the option of 
leaving the wound open at night may be considered.  
Indeterminate ulcers with significant eschar/crust formation (no longer open):  
 
Ulcers should continue to be cleaned once daily.  AT this time either sterile normal saline or 
sterile water may be used by [CONTACT_544888].  
 
When eschar/crust forms, hydrogen peroxide onc e daily should be used (to help remove eschar 
formation).  The 3% hydrogen peroxide solution can be used by [CONTACT_544889] a 
sterile q - tip, depending on the size of the ulcer. Add 1 table spoon of hydrogen peroxide solution 
in 5 table spoons of water (1:5 concentration).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At this stage the ulcer may be kept clean and dry overnight. During activities a dressing of gauze 
and secured by [CONTACT_544890], Nexcare waterproof tape or a Band -Aid may be used to protect the 

 July 10, 2017  Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version 4 Page 54 of 56  
wound.  
 
You may continue with vitamin E oil applied one daily.  In this case the vitamin E oil can be 
applied directly to the ulcer.  
 
Debridement should not be performed during the double -blind phase of the study unless it is 
clinically indicated.  (e.g.,  for treatment of  an infection. )

Version: 03.09.[ADDRESS_242652]: [ADDRESS_242653] in- office postpartum blood pressure monitoring to at -home monitoring for patient 
diagnosed with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, pre- eclampsia with or 
without severe features, and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre- eclampsia) with regard to 
identification of elevated blood pressures , adherence to ACOG guidelines for blood pressure 
monitoring, timing of the identification and treatment of elevated blood pressures, readmission, and 
patient satisfaction  
 
B. Background  
 
A large segment of our patient population is diagnosed with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, 
including gestational hypertension and pre- eclampsia. New ACOG guidelines recommend postpartum 
monitoring of blood pressures via blood pressure checks on day [ADDRESS_242654] postpartum office- based blood pressure monitoring in 
performing the recommended postpartum follow -up for patients with hypertensiv e disorders of 
pregnancy.  
 C. Study Methodology  
 
1. Study Design  
 
Randomized control led trial 
 
2. Comparison Groups: 
 
1: Control group:  
 
A. Standard monitoring: Postpartum blood pressure checks in the outpatient 
setting on postpartum days 7- 10 
 
2: Intervention group:  
 
B. At-home monitoring: Postpartum blood pressure checks twice a day for 16 
days using supplies and phone app provided by [CONTACT_203397] 
 
3. Procedures:  
 
Identification of Potentially Eligible Patients  
 
1. Potentially eligible patients identified in the postpartum period at GMH and MUSC  
based on documented diagnosis of pregnancy -related hypertension in the antepartum, 
intrapartum, or postpartum period  
 
 
Study Enrollment  
 
2. The patient is approached for study participation by a member of the study staff  
3. The enrollment process involves a face- to-face interview with study staff  for verification 
of study eligibility and counseling regarding study procedures, potential benefits and 
risks, prior to obtaining written consent.  
4. Enrollment will occur on the post partum unit in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203396] 03.09.[ADDRESS_242655] call/text from a provider  
C. Assurance that mobile phone number listed in the chart is correct  
D. See flowsheet at the end of this document for decision tree regarding patient contact [CONTACT_203398]  
 
4. Outcomes:  
 
1. Primary: percentage of patients with blood pressure ascertainment within the first 10 
days following discharge  
2. Secondary outcomes:   
A. Adherence to ACOG guidelines for postpartum blood pressure monitoring  
o Defined as blood pressure ascertainment at [ADDRESS_242656] delivery  
B. Rates of initiation of anti -hypertensive medication  
C. Rates of readmission and postpartum triage utilization  
D. Timing of the identification and treatment of severe blood pressures  (>/= 
160/100) . See flow  diagram for further details  
E. Patient satisfaction with question scored by a  5 point Likert scale  
F. Subgroup analysis of primary outcome stratified by [CONTACT_203399]- White race  
 
5. Study Population:  
 All postpartum women  at GMH and MUSC with a diagnosis of gestational hypertension, 
pre-eclampsia with or without severe features  which also includes chronic hypertension 
with superimposed preeclampsia  
 6. Inclusion Criteria:  
 1. Age >18  
2. English is primary language 
3. Ability to receive calls and unlimited texts  
4. Unlimited texting on cell phone  
5. Can receive phone calls on cell phone  
6. Arm can accommodate BP cuff  
 
7. Exclusion Criteria:  
 
1. BMI > [ADDRESS_242657] unlimited texting capability on cell phone 
 
8. Allocation Method  
 
Randomization will be done after consent is obtained by [CONTACT_203400] 03.09.2021  4 
  
9. Withdrawals, Losses and Deviations  
 
As the primary outcome is ascertainment of blood pressure within 10 days of discharge, 
we will be observing if patients do not participate in their group’s allocated care; they will 
not be removed from their study group  
 
10. Data Collection/Outcome Measurement  
 
Baseline patient characteristics will be obtained on enrollment. Subject outcomes will be catalogued by [CONTACT_203401]. REDCap will be utilized for data 
collection.  
 
11. Study Size and Power  
 
Our sample size calculation for this study is based upon a prior published study 
investigating  postpartum blood pressure ascertainment in  a similar population of women 
with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy by [CONTACT_203402].  In their cohort, a blood 
pressure was obtained in 43.7% of patients in the usual care group versus  92.2%  in the 
text-based blood pressure monitoring group. We will assume a slightly more conservative 
estimate of 50% blood pressure ascertainment in the usual care group and 70% in the text -
based group. With a two-sided alpha of 0.05% and 80% power, we would need to enroll 
93 patients in each arm for a total population of 186 .  
 
12. Analytic Plan  
 
• Intention to treat analysis  
• No exclusions for protocol violations or post -randomization exclusions  
• Calculation of RR and 95% CI for primary outcome  
• Univariate analysis of independent variabl es 
 
D. Possible Risks  
 Minimal risk to the patient  is associated with this study. The most likely risk to the patient would be loss 
of confidentially. I f a patient is started on antihypertensive therapy,  it is possible that  side effects from 
the chosen medicine may be experienced. However,  the medications used for treatment are standard 
of care for patients outside of the study as well .  
 E. Possible Benefits  
 
This research study is not expected to directly benefit individual subjects,  but is likely to yield 
generalizable knowledge which contributes to the field.  It may benefit individual patients by [CONTACT_203403].  
 
  
Ver 03.09.[ADDRESS_242658] already deployed this 
process. Their experience has shown this to be safe and feasible  
 G. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality  
 
Individual patient data collected as part of this investigation will remain confidential.  Composite results 
from this investigation, however, will be disseminated t o the scientific community.  The data sheet will 
contain the patient’s name [CONTACT_203405].  Actual data collection will only be performed by [CONTACT_203404].  Once 
the data is collected, each patient will be assigned an alpha- numeric identifier which will allow entry of 
de-identified data in a computer database. The original data sheets will be stored in a secure location 
in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

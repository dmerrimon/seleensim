VERSION NUMBER: Version 18 
VERSION DATE: May 24, 2018  
OBJECTIVES:  
The goal of this research project is to see if deficient sleep and/or circadian disruption are partly 
responsible for the increased risk of diabetes among African Americans by [CONTACT_562781]. 
 
Specific Aim 1: Disparities in sleep and circadian timing at home  
Hypothesis 1: African-Americans will have shorter habitual sleep duration (wrist actigraphy), 
less slow-wave sleep (polysomnography [PSG]) at home, and as our pi[INVESTIGATOR_562767], 
sleep at later clock times, have a later circadian phase (dim light melatonin onset [DLMO]), and thus sleep at a different circadian phase (DLMO-midpoint of sleep interval) than non-
Hispanic whites. 
  
Specific Aim 2: Association between sleep/circadian measures and diabetes risk   
Hypothesis 2: Deficient sleep duration and quality (shorter habitual sleep time, less slow-wave sleep [SWS], lower slow-wave activity [SWA]), a later DLMO and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] a 
different circadian phase (DLMO-midpoint of sleep interval) will be associated with greater 
diabetes risk (indicated by [CONTACT_562782]).   Hypothesis 3: African-Americans will have gr eater risk of diabetes (indicated by [CONTACT_562783]) than non-Hispanic whites and this difference will be partially and significantly mediated by [CONTACT_562784] (identified by [CONTACT_562785] 2). 
 
STUDY DESIGN 
INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 
This study will recruit African Americans (AA) and non-Hispanic whites (WH) with equal 
numbers of men and women in each group completing the entire study. Ages will be 21-50 
years and body mass indices (BMI) will be <40 kg/m2.  To ensure equal age and BMI 
distribution, we will recruit stratified by [CONTACT_654] (21-35 or 36-50 years) and BMI (<30 or 30-39 kg/m2) 
within each racial group.   
Each subject will undergo an overnight screening that will include a clinical examination, 
and routine laboratory tests (including CBC/hematocrit).  An overnight PSG will be performed to rule out sleep disorders, including moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-
hypopnea index>15/hour).  We will also perform an oral glucose tolerance test (see details 
below).  Additional inclusion criteria include no major illness and no history of psychiatric, 
Version #:18 Version Date:  05/24/2018 Page 2 of 11 endocrine, cardiac or sleep disorders, and premenopausal women.  Those with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_562768] a stable treatment, such 
as lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications (except beta-blockers).   
Exclusion criteria include: persons with diabetes, diagnosed sleep disorders, history of 
cardiovascular event or disease (excluding controlled hypertension), major psychiatric disorder 
or other major illness.  Persons taking medications, including but not limited to antidepressants and hypnotics (but excluding lipid-lowering dr ugs and anti-hypertensive medications as 
mentioned above), will be excluded.  Also persons regularly taking medication that affects 
melatonin such as beta blockers and exogenous melatonin will be excluded.  We will also 
exclude anyone who tests positive for common drugs of abuse, people with color blindness and people who have had Lasik eye surgery, or work night shifts in the month prior to study.  Participants who travel across time zones will be studied only after they have remained in the Central Time Zone (or Indiana) for one month prior to the study. Adults unable to consent, 
individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers), pregnant women, and prisoners are also excluded.  Subjects who remain eligible after screening will then be scheduled for a one week in-home assessment, which will be followed by [CONTACT_1629] 18- hour laboratory study.  The subjects will be 
given a brief sleep diary at screening to complete prior to the naturalistic session if they are 
eligible for the study.  This brief diary asks for bed times and wake times, which is used to set 
up the equipment for the at-home saliva sampling.
 
  
STUDY-WIDE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: 
The study was previously conducted at Univer sity of Chicago, recruitment, enrollment, and 
study procedures occurred from 2012 to November 2016. In that time, the study consented 176 
subjects, screened 107, and had 53 subjects complete  the study. Now Northwestern University 
will be the only site where recruitment and partici pation in the study will occur. See “Number of 
Local Participants” for total study numbers.   
 
STUDY TIMELINES:  
Each subject is expected to participate for a total of about 12 days: 1 overnight screening visit, 10 days in naturalistic session, followed by [CONTACT_562786]. Overall duration of this protocol from signing consent form to completing of the entire study will range from 4-12 weeks.  Recruitment will be comp leted by 5/31/2018 and primary data analysis by 
5/31/2019.  STUDY ENDPOINTS: 
The goal of this research project is to see if deficient sleep and/or circadian disruption are partly 
responsible for the increased risk of diabetes among African Americans by [CONTACT_562787]. 
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVED: 
In-home assessment :  The in-home assessment will last  approximately [ADDRESS_739581] actigraphy monitor and complete sleep diaries to 
estimate habitual sleep duration and timing ( Figure 1).  On the Days [ADDRESS_739582] saliva samples (details below) to estimate 
circadian phase (DLMO).  Participants will be asked to refrain from taking NSAIDs during these two days during the in-home assessment because they suppress melatonin levels.  A list of NSAIDs by [CONTACT_562788] a sample of Tylenol 
Version #:18 Version Date:  05/24/[ADDRESS_739583].  On one 
of the nights after the DLMO collection (between Days 5 through 9), a mixed gender research 
team will visit the participant’s home to pi[INVESTIGATOR_562769]-home PSG recording.  A sound pressure meter and light sensor (Actiwatch-2) will 
be placed in the participant’s bedroom the night of the PSG recording to measure sound and light levels during the sleep period.  On Days 7-9, they will also complete a 3-day food diary that 
asks for both the amount and types of food eaten and time of meals and snacks.    
 
During this session, participants will also complete questionnaires that assess subjective sleep 
and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272], Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], Sleep Habits 
Questionnaire, Sleep Environment, Sleep Recordi ng Experience), circadian preference (Horne-
Ostberg, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire), physical activity (International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire – Short Version), health factors (self-rated health 1, Physical Health 
Questionnaire 2., caffeine, alcohol and tobacco use) sociodemographic factors and psychosocial 
measures.  Sociodemographic information will include employment status, education, work hours, household size, number of children, the presence of a bed partner and the MacArthur 
Socioeconomic Questionnaire.  We will also administer several psychosocial questionnaires, 
including Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale 
3, chronic stress questionnaire 4, three-item 
Loneliness Scale 5, Perceived Racism Scale 6, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List 7, the 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7307] - Depression Scale 8, and the short version of the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73612]-Trait Anxiety Inventory 9. Questionnaire responses will be entered into the password-
protected REDCap database and saved accord ing to confidential study ID number.  
 
Laboratory Session :  Within one week of the in-home assessment, participants will spend 
approximately 21 hours in the sleep research laboratory (W4) or Clinical Research Center (W5) to obtain detailed characteristics of diabetes ri sk.  They will be admitted to the laboratory by 
17:00.  Saliva samples will be collected every 30 minutes beginning 4.5 hours before bedtime, at 17:30, up to bedtime at 22:00 (total of 10 samples) for cortisol and melatonin. Time in bed in the laboratory will be from 22:00 to 8:00.  PSG will be recorded if the at-home PSG is invalid.  
Actigraphy will be recorded through the session. Urine samples will be collected from 6:[ADDRESS_739584] for secretion of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6-s), a principal metabolite of melatonin excreted in urine and has been associated with glucose metabolism 
10. ELISA readouts for aMT6-s are calculated after 
adjusting for creatinine levels in each sample.  In the morning after the first night, bioimpedance will be measured to estimate body fat percent age.  Then, a 5-hour frequently-sampled oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be perform ed.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be measured 
continuously.  Blood pressure (BP) will be recorded starting at 20:[ADDRESS_739585] day until 2:00, Figure 1. Full Protocol

samples will be collected for the measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide concentrations at –10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300 min after glucose ingestion. Insulin secretion rates (ISR) will be calculated by [CONTACT_562789] C-peptide levels 
11. In addition to 
fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and ISR levels, the areas under the curve (AUCs) will be calculated using the trapezoid method. Homeos tasis model assessment (HOMA) measures of 
beta cell function and insulin resistance will be calculated from fasting values and the insulinogenic-index will be derived. Indexes of bet a-cell function and insulin sensitivity will be 
estimated using the oral minimal model. Indexes of beta-cell function will be estimated from 
plasma glucose and C-peptide concentrations using the oral minimal model of C-peptide 
secretion and kinetics 
12-[ADDRESS_739588] (OGTT) will be performed after an overnight 
fast to rule out the presence of diabetes.  Blood samples will be taken beginning with baseline samples at -15 and 0 minutes. At time 0, 75g of glucose will be administered orally over 5 minutes. A final blood sample will then be collected at 120 minutes after ingestion. The glucose levels at 0 and 120 minutes will be used as diagnostic measures for diabetes.   
 
Sleep Measures 
Polysomnography (PSG)  
Sleep will be recorded in the home, during the screening session and in the laboratory 
session if necessary using digital acquisiti on systems (Nihon Kohden, CA). Recordings will 
include electroencephalography (EEG), electrooc ulography (EOG), electromyography (EMG) 
and electrocardiography (ECG) signals. In addition, oronasal airflow by [CONTACT_562790], respi[INVESTIGATOR_562770], 
and pulse oximetry will be recorded at screening. Each 30-sec epoch of recording will be scored as stage Wake, I, II, III or REM following standard criteria 
15,[ADDRESS_739589]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343], periodic limb movements and microarousals will be scored according to established criteria 
17,18. Spectral 
analysis of EEG in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta and gamma bands will be performed using the PRANA software (PhiTools, Strasbourg, [LOCATION_009]).   
 
Wrist Actigraphy Monitoring 
 Sleep timing and duration will be assessed during the naturalistic and laboratory sessions using waterproof wrist actigraphy monitors (Actiwatch-2, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770]/Philips).  Due to the 
unobtrusive nature of this device, habitual sleep behavior can be measured over several days.  [CONTACT_562820] has extensive experience working with actigraphy data and has found a great deal of variability within individuals from day to day 
19.  Thus, a full week of actigraphy is necessary to 
estimate habitual sleep patterns.  Participants will be asked to wear the Actiwatch continuously 
for the entire naturalistic session and during the laboratory session.  Actiwatch activity monitors 
feature digital integration, which is the most accurate measure of both movement level and intensity.  In order to calculate the various sleep characteristics, an estimate of bedtime and wake time is obtained from two sources, the Actiwatch event marker and the sleep log.  The 
Version #:18 Version Date:  05/24/[ADDRESS_739590] presses to “mark” the data.  This does not 
affect data collection but simply provides a mark in the data which can be used to set the bed 
time and wake time.  The subject is also asked to complete a sleep log each morning, and this 
provides an additional method to determine bedtime and wake time.  The combination of these two collection methods provides the most accurate determination of bedtime and wake time.  Our primary measure of habitual sleep will be nocturnal sleep duration as well as the timing of sleep, however, we will also examine indicators of sleep quality (sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation) and nappi[INVESTIGATOR_172510].  Circadian Measures 
 As described above, we will collect saliva samples in the home to estimate circadian phase 
from the DLMO, and this will be our primary measure of circadian phase.  During a start-up appointment, subjects will receive the Actiwatch, questionnaires, and at-home saliva collection 
kit and given extensive verbal and written instructions about the procedures.  On the day of the 
planned saliva collection, a research assistant will call the participant at a prearranged time and 
remind them of the instructions for the at-home saliva collection.  Collection will begin 6 hours prior to bedtime.  The at-home saliva colle ction kit comes in a black messenger bag and 
consists of: a step-by-step checklist (with sta ff phone number), track cap bottle (with microchip 
in lid that records opening, MEMS, Aardex) containing [ADDRESS_739591] tube rack, timer (PDA) with preprogrammed alarms, label dispenser (pre-labeled to avoid incorrect sample labeling), soft toothbrush (to avoid toothpaste contamination), insulated travel bag for frozen samp les, 8 Tylenol pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (to avoid inadvertent use 
of NSAIDs), photosensor to be worn around the neck on top of clothing (Actiwatch Spectrum, wrist worn photosensors are easily covered by [CONTACT_562791]), and sunglasses (Noir medicals; frame 
style 21 or frame style 30 fitted with a filter #23) worn through the evening of the saliva sampling session until bedtime (to reduce light intensity received by [CONTACT_562792]).  The checklist advises participants to close bl inds and/or curtains to avoid outdoor light, and 
dim lights to a practical level (including bathroom lights).  Participants are prompted by 
[CONTACT_562793] [ADDRESS_739592], subjects remove their light medallion and go to bed.  On the following night the research team that sets up the at-home PSG, will pack all 
frozen samples in the insulated travel bag and transport samples to the lab. 
 On arrival in the laboratory the saliva samples are thawed, centrifuged and then refrozen and shipped for RIA assay by [CONTACT_562794] (Portland, ME).  The sensitivity of the assay is 0.7 pg/ml, intra-assay variance (<11%) and inter-assay variance (<14%).  The results of the assay will be emailed to [CONTACT_562820] who will remove subject and condition codes and forward the 
data to [CONTACT_409720].  [CONTACT_409720] will calculate the DLMOs and a research assistant will confirm 
the scoring before the results are unblinded.  As recommended by a consensus report [CONTACT_409720] recently coauthored 
20, we will calculate the DLMO threshold as the mean of 3 low 
daytime points plus 2 times the SD of the 3 points.  Our previous study 21 showed that in 100% 
of our large sample (n=170) the DLMO occurred within the 6 hour window prior to habitual bedtime.  Even DLMOs of extreme night owls are captured before habitual bedtime if low 
thresholds for DLMO detection are used 
22-24.  If we find that there are not enough low daytime 
points in a melatonin profile, we will follow the consensus report and use a fixed low threshold of 
3 pg/ml.  Very occasionally melatonin levels rise above and then fall below the threshold more than once. In this case the DLMO will be defined as when melatonin levels begin to stay above threshold for ≥  2 h (e.g. 
25). 
Version #:18 Version Date:  05/24/[ADDRESS_739593]. Burgess has a lot of experience collecting and analyzing light data and can easily 
identify noncompliance (e.g. artificially stable light indicates photosensor taken off).  She has 
previously recorded ambient li ght levels in people’s homes 25,26 and found they are naturally 
quite low (<50 lux). Research indicates that melatonin is not significantly suppressed by [CONTACT_562795] 27 and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_562771]. In addition to the DLMO we will also examine 
the timing of habitual sleep based on actigraphy, the timing of meals and circadian preference based on the Horne-Osberg Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire 
28. 
 
Cardiovascular and Autonomic Measurements  Systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure will be measured at 30-minute intervals from 
the non-dominant arm using ambulatory moni toring equipment (Oscar II, SunTech Medical 
Instruments). Heart rate variability will be calculated using the ECG recording from the PSG recording. Please note [CONTACT_409720] is experienced in the assessment of heart rate variability 
measures 
29-34. We will also assay an inflammatory marker, high sensitively c-reactive protein 
(hsCRP), and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_562772]. 
Power Analysis 
For the grant transfer, we calculated the sample size required to detect a difference between the 
whites and African Americans using the standard deviation from the already-collected data in 
this study for independent sample t tests.  I used an alpha of .[ADDRESS_739594] significant associations (p<.05) between two continuous variables using the same standard deviations as in table below. We will have 80% power to detect a change in 1000 units of DI per 1 SD of each sleep/circadian variable with [ADDRESS_739595] 80% to detect a change in 500 units of DI per 1 SD of each sleep/circadian variable with [ADDRESS_739596] a change of 5 units per SD of each sleep/circadian variable (80% power, alpha=.05) with ~9 subjects and 2 units with ~[ADDRESS_739597] differences between races.

Version #:18 Version Date:  05/24/2018 Page 7 of 11 using a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of α = 0.005, to reduce type I errors due to multiple

the dependent variables will be considered if the model residuals are not approximately 
normally distributed.  All regression models descr ibed below will be checked for fit to the data 
through examination of residuals and other regression diagnostic techniques 35.   
 Linear regression models will be estimated to test for differences in the sleep and circadian measures between African Americans and whites.  Covariates for which we will adjust include age, sex and BMI or body fat percentage.  Secondary analysis will include examination of 
potential sociodemographic and psychosocial confounders of this association. Linear regression 
models will also be estimated to test for associations between our primary metabolic outcome, Disposition Index, and measures of sleep, in cluding duration and percentage from actigraphy 
and Stage [ADDRESS_739600]-protected computers.  Data files and documents (with the exception of the consent form) will be stripped of identifying information and subjects will be identified only by a study ID code.  Only one file will have the 
name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_562796], and this information will be linked for the 
duration of the study (5 years).  After this time, the linked information will be destroyed. 
 
PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS:  
All adverse events, serious and non-serious, occurring during the course of the study will be 
collected, fully documented, and reported to the Northwestern University Internal Review Board 
(IRB) by [CONTACT_079], [CONTACT_562820]. For each adverse event, the investigator will 
provide the onset, duration, intensity and treatment required, outcome and action taken. We 
anticipate that adverse events during this study would be related to drawing blood, resulting in a 
bruise at the site of vein puncture, inflammation of the vein, and infection. All reasonable care 
will be taken to avoid these complications. In addition to adverse event reporting, the 
investigators will report a summary of the prot ocol findings, subject recruitment, drop-outs, and 
events to the IRB annually. The physiological studies will be conducted in the Northwestern 
CRU, and as such, will be overseen by [CONTACT_562797]. All data will be 
kept confidential and in a locked cabinet. On ly approved study personnel will have access to 
study related documents.  
 WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS: 
Participants are free to choose to stop participation in the study at any time.  They will be 
explicitly told that choosing not to be in this study  or to stop being in this study will not result in 
any penalty to them or loss of benefit to which th ey are entitled.  Specifically, the choice to 
withdraw will not negatively affect the right to any present or future medical treatment to which 
they are otherwise entitled. If participants withdraw, the procedure will immediately stop, they 
will be asked to fill out paperwork regarding monetary compensation for the completed portion 
of the study.  Compensation will be prorated on the number of visits completed as described in 
the consent form.   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_562773]. Reasons for removal may include: 1) it is in the best interest of the participants’ health, 2) the participant is unable to follow the directions of the study, or 3) the participant no longer qualifies for the study, or 4) the study stops. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_533784] a participant from the study, they 
Version #:18 Version Date:  05/24/2018 Page 8 of 11 will always explain the reasons for doing so and will help arrange for continued care the 
participants own doctor, if needed.   RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS: 
The clinical procedures involve minimal discomfort associated with venipuncture. There is also 
slight risk of inflammation of the vein or infection. However, our nurses who perform these procedures are highly trained and thus these risks are minimal. The amount of blood withdrawn is minimized to prevent significant blood loss. Baseline hematocrit will be measured in all 
subjects to ensure that this risk is not excessive.  Furthermore, a study physician will be 
available should any medical concerns arise. Participation is voluntary and participants may 
withdraw from the study at any time.  There is potential risk of breach of privacy and confidentiality which will be minimized by [CONTACT_562798] a participant number. Names will not be stored 
with the participant data. Identifying information will be stored separately in a password protected file that will be linked to a participant number.   POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS: 
There is no direct benefit to the subject for participating in this study. The information gained 
from this study will help to better understand the relationship between habitual sleep behavior and characteristics in real-life conditions (i.e. the person’s own home) and cardiometabolic risk.  
Furthermore, this study will also determine whether differences in sleep characteristics partly explain differences in diabetes risk between African Americans and whites. Ultimately, future 
studies may provide novel insights into the mechanisms linking impaired or insufficient sleep 
with the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. The risks are only minimal and the risk-to-benefit ratio is very small. 
 
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS: 
Potential risk of breach of privacy and confidentiality will be minimized by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-identifying the data 
with participant number. Paper copy of the su rveys will be stored in a locked cabinet in the 
Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Research Laboratory. Each participant will be assigned a study number, and the participant name [CONTACT_562815], which is only accessible to IRB-approved study team me mbers, and requires a unique password for each 
user.  REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capt ure) is a secure, web-based application for 
building and managing online data capture for research studies. Northwestern University is a member of the REDCap consortium. All data co llected from the surveys will be de-identified and 
entered into REDCap or an excel file that is on a password protected computer and server.  Data collected from PSG and electrocardiogram will be downloaded to a password protected computer in the Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Research Laboratory for analysis. After all data is 
collected and analyzed, all files containing identifying information will be destroyed. Only one file 
will have the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_562796], and this information will be linked for the duration of the study (5 years).  After this time, the linked information will be destroyed.  Note this protocol involves collaboration with [CONTACT_449241] from Rush University.  Her 
expertise in assessing DLMO at home is required. She will assist with data analysis of 
melatonin to identify DLMO, but the data will all be de-identified before being shared.  This protocol will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_562799].

University.
Why am  I being asked to take part in this research study?
We are  asking you to take part in this research study because you are a healthy adult between 
the ages of 21-50.
What should  I know about a research study?
Someone  will explain this research study to you.
Whether  or not you take part is up to you.
You  can choose not to take part.
You  can agree to take part and later change your mind.
Your  decision will not be held against you.
You  can ask all the questions you want before you decide.
Why is  this research being done?
The purpose  of this study is to determine if deficient sleep and/or disruption with the body’s 
internal clock (“circadian rhythms”) are associated with diabetes risk. This study is being done to 
look at the possible relationships between sleep and risk of diabetes by [CONTACT_562802].  
How long  will the research last and what will I need to do?
We expect  that you will be in this research study for two-four weeks and require [ADDRESS_739602] an 
“oral glucose tolerance test,” which measures how your body uses sugar. An IV will be inserted 
into your arm and blood will be sampled before and after drinking a sugary solution, totaling less 
than [ADDRESS_739603] an unattended in-home sleep recording.Key Information:  
The first few pages of this document include a summary of this study to help you 
decide whether or not to participate. Detailed information is provided after the 
summary.

during the screening visit but lasting 5 hours.
More detailed  information about the study procedures can be found under the section What 
happens if I say “Yes, I want to be in this research”?
Is there  any way being in this study could be bad for me?
You may  experience slight irritation at the site where polysomnography sensors are placed. You 
may also experience pain, irritation, or inflammation from the IV insertion and blood draws. 
Irritation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_562776]. There is a risk of loss of 
confidentiality, but all personal information will be kept in locked cabinets. 
More detailed  information about the risks of this study can be found under “Is there any way 
being in this study could be bad for me? (Detailed Risks)”
Will being  in this study help me in any way?
There are  no benefits to you from your taking part in this research. We hope the information 
learned from this study will help us further understand the relationship between sleep and 
diabetes.
Who can  I talk to?

Page 3  of 10 Version Date: 03/08/2018Screening:  One single overnight stay followed  by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_739605] any sleep disorders. 
The screening  will include the following: 
A  sleep study with electrodes (sensors) pasted on your head to measure your brain waves 
and on your legs to measure your leg movements. You will also be wearing sensors that 
will be put in front of your nose, around your chest and belly to measure your breathing 
and a small sensor will be taped on your finger to measure your blood oxygen level 
(without collecting any blood) overnight.
The  next morning, you will have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). For this test you 
will fast (only water and no food) beginning at 9 pm the night before the OGTT. In the 
morning a small flexible needle (an IV) will be inserted into a vein of your arm to allow for 
blood samples to be drawn. You will be given a drink (about 1 1/3 cups) which contains 75 
grams of glucose (sugar). You will be asked to drink this sugar mix over 5 minutes. Twice 
before taking the drink and then 2 hours after drinking the sugar solution, approximately 
1/3 of a teaspoon of blood will be drawn for measurement of glucose (sugar) levels. To 
allow for continuous blood sampling from the IV, a small amount of saline will run through 
the IV. In total less than [ADDRESS_739606] is designed to determine if your pancreas responds normally to this 
oral glucose challenge. 
You  will also have a medical history, a physical examination, and urine drug screening. 
Also, during the OGTT, an additional 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for a complete 
blood count (CBC), liver, and kidney tests, and a urine pregnancy test for women. If you 
are pregnant, you will not be able to participate. If your blood count is low you may be 
given iron supplements and asked to come back for a repeat blood count in about [ADDRESS_739607] depressive symptoms.  If so, you will be given the University of Chicago mental 
health clinic phone number for follow-up care.
In-home Assessment :  
The In-home  Assessment will last 10 days (see outline below) during which you will 
continuously wear a waterproof wrist activity monitor and complete sleep diaries to estimate 
sleep duration and  timing.  The activity monitor is a way we can get an idea of your sleep 
patterns by  [CONTACT_562803].  The monitor also measures the light in the 
room.  You will  also complete a 3-day food diary that asks for both the amount and types of food 
eaten and time of meals and snacks.  On the first and second day you will be instructed to 
abstain from caffeine and alcohol and that afternoon and evening, and you are also asked to 
avoid taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDS”), including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], ibuprofen 
(Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).  We will give you a complete list of these drugs. On 
the second day you will be instructed to collect saliva samples every 30 minutes beginning 6 
hours before your bedtime up until bedtime.  We will ask you to tell us what your usual bedtime 
is in order to schedule this session.  You will visit the laboratory either the day before Day 1 or

these samples. On one of the nights between days 5 and 10, two research team members will 
visit your home to pi[INVESTIGATOR_562777]-home 
sleep recording (“PSG”).  The sleep study will include these sensors as in the screening sleep 
study.  A sound meter and light sensor will be placed in your bedroom to measure sound and 
light levels during your sleep period. One of them will return in the morning to pi[INVESTIGATOR_562778]. During this week, you will also complete questionnaires that ask about your sleep 
habits, time of day preferences for various activities, and several measures of mood and health.

Detailed Risks:  Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?
This research  may hurt you in the following ways: 
There  is a slight risk of irritation at the site of the electrode (sensor) placement for 
polysomnography.  This irritation would be temporary and care will be taken to avoid any 
irritation.
There  is the risk of loss of confidentiality of your information.  All data will be kept in locked 
cabinets in research offices and care will be taken to prevent loss of confidentiality.
Temporary  pain, slight bruising, possible inflammation, and possible fainting may occur from 
IV insertion during the oral glucose tolerance tests.
Low  blood glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test may also result in 
lightheadedness, rapid heartbeat, irritability, shakiness, headache, and fainting.  
Care will  be taken to avoid these complications. An experienced research nurse will insert the IV 
under sterile conditions, and glucose levels are measured immediately, so if levels get too low, 
the test will be stopped and juice will be provided.
This study involves  the use of your identifiable, personal information and there is a chance that 
a loss of confidentiality could occur. The researchers have procedures in place to reduce the

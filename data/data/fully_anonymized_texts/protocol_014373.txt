Issued 10 January 2017  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
PROTOCOL TITLE  Molecular -guided therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed 
and refractory childhood cancers  
PROTOCOL NUMBER  NMTRC009  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Feasibility  
OBJECTIVES  Primary  
Determine feasibility of using tumor samples to assess genomic 
sequencing using predictive modeling to make real -time treatment 
decisions for children with relapsed/refractory cancers  
 
Secondary  
• To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on:  
• Overall response rate (ORR)  
• Progression free survival (PFS)  
• To continue to evaluate the safety of allowing a molecular tumor 
board to determine individualized treatment plans  
• (Voluntary) To explore the relationship between tumor 
phenotype/genotype and response by [CONTACT_59506] a correlative biologic study  
• To compare PFS interval to PFS intervals of previous 
chemotherapy regimens since relapse for each subject . 
• Sub analysis  examination  of disease types.  
STUDY DESIGN  A prospective open label, multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  
of molecularly guided therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory childhood cancers  
 
A total of [ADDRESS_1210813] relapsed on conventional therapy will be treated 
with molecular guided therapy.  Additional patients may enroll through 
compassionate access if no other treatment options are available.  
 
Subjects will be evaluated in 3 strata:  
• Stratum 1 : 50 subjects with refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma 
• Stratum 2 : 50 subjects with relapsed or refractory brain tumors  
• Stratum 3 : 100 subjects with refractory or relapsed rare tumors  
 
Guided therapy will allow the use of individualized therapeutic 
combinations (up to 4 agents). All subjects will be followed for 
survival, disease response, progression and safety.  All subjects will be 
treated according to the discretion of the treating oncologist and study 
committee (minimum [ADDRESS_1210814]). Extent of 
disease will be measured and assessed for changes throughout the 
course of the study.

1 Background  
 
1.1 Study Disease 
 
Relapsed or refractory  neuroblastoma, brain tumors, and rare childhood tumors.  
 
1.2 Rationale  
 
Lethality of Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Cancers  is an Unmet Clinical Need . 
 
Although improvements in the past [ADDRESS_1210822] led to markedly improved survival rates of 
approximately 80% overall for pediatric cancers, patients with relapsed, rare and advanced stage 
tumors still have a very poor prognosis. Soft tissue sarcomas account for ~ 7% of pediatric 
cancers, with 850 -900 new cases annually in the [LOCATION_002] [1] .  Rhabdomyosarcoma, the most 
common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, affects nearly 350 children in the [LOCATION_002] each year [1].  Patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma have a poor prognosis with an overall survival rate of ~30% [2]. The non- rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas affect ~[ADDRESS_1210823] 
long- term survival < 20% [3] .  Malignant bone tumors (mainly Ewing’s Sarcoma and 
Osteosarcoma) account for 6% of childhood cancers, with ~400 cases of osteosarcoma and 200 
cases of Ewing’s Sarcoma diagnosed annually [1]. Patients with localized osteosarcoma, who 
have a poor response to pre -operative chemotherapy have a survival rate of around 50%, while 
patients with metastatic osteosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma disease at presentation, have a survival 
of < 20% [4, 5] .  Renal cancers account for ~6% of pediatric cancer diagnoses, with 95% of cases 
being Wilms Tumor, which has a very favorable prognosis [1].  However, rare and high risk renal 
tumors such as metastatic anaplastic Wilms tumor, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, renal cell 
carcinoma, and malignant rhabdoid tumor have an inferior outcome, with survival of < 20% [6, 
7]. For all these patients survival remains poor, despi[INVESTIGATOR_59318] -intensified multi- agent 
chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Therefore, new approaches such as targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59319].  
 
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, with approximately 700 
new diagnoses per year . It accounts for 7% to 10% of childhood cancers [8, 9] .  Whereas the 
prognosis for infants with neuroblastoma is generally good, currently only 30% of children 
diagnosed after 12- 15 months of age survive despi[INVESTIGATOR_59313] [10, 11] .  
Even with high- dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed
 by [CONTACT_59512] 
(HSCT) and maintenance therapy with retinoic acid the 5 -year event -free survival remains below 
50% [12, 13] .  Long- term survival of patients who are treated with conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_867926] <5%. As such, neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths in the [LOCATION_002] [14] . Consequently, the evaluation of
 new drugs is strongly needed in this 
disease.  
 
Recent evidence has established the genetic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma  and revealed the 
existence of several major molecular subsets that collectively may provide prognostic value for future disease management [15]  [16]. While the poor prognosis for older neuroblastoma patients 
underscores the need for new treatment strategies, the elucidation of specific biologic subsets of neuroblastoma suggests a way to improve disease management. The current standard- of-care 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210824] response rates (10% -35%) [11]. Even in responding patients, tumors 
often go on to further rapid relapses and novel strategies to treat this patient population are 
urgently needed. There are currently few treatment options from which pediatric oncologists can 
select with any degree of confidence to improve the management of multiply recurrent 
neuroblastoma patients. The current strategy is to add salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59315], which often lead s to drug- related toxicity but may or may 
not extend life. The identification of agents that target specific molecular pathways associated with the development and/or progression of neoplastic diseases holds promise. Improved 
approaches that identify in a more rational (data- driven) fashion combinations of existing agents 
that are likely to be effective should result in a survival benefit in the clinical setting, while 
avoiding the toxicity associated with agents that are unlikely to be beneficial. [17] . 
 
CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, with 3000- 4000 new diagnoses each 
year. CNS tumors account for approximately 25- 30% of all childhood cancers. Though many of 
these CNS tumors are quite treatable, the 5 -year survival for pediatric CNS tumors is only 
71%[18]. Patients who have relapsed and refractory CNS tumors are those most likely to 
succumb to their disease, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_59316], often followed by [CONTACT_59513] [19, 20] . Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed for control of CNS tumors.  
 There is a growing focus on treating CNS tumors based on the biology of the disease [21, 22]  
rather than with “one size fits all” therapy. Risk stratification in CNS tumors based on biology is 
increasingly understood to be a priority. For example, medulloblastoma has been broken into 4 
biologic categories with different genetic mutations and different clinical outcomes [23-25]. 
Similar to neuroblastoma, these differences in the biology and clinical outcome of patients with 
medulloblastoma suggest new strategies to improve disease management. Ongoing clinical trials 
of upfront therapy for medulloblastoma are attempting to incorporate molecularly guided 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The current standard -of-care treatments for relapsed CNS tumors include Phase I and 
Phase II therapi[INVESTIGATOR_867927], if any, responding patients [26, 27] . Again reflecting the 
challenges in neuroblastoma, responding patients with high grade CNS tumors often experience multiple relapses and are in dire need of novel treatment strategies. Improved approaches that can 
inform treatment regimens based on the biology of the disease could result in a survival benefit in 
this challenging patient population.  
 
Molecular Networks as the Drug Target .  
It is now firmly established that cancer results from perturbations in the molecular networks 
within cellular systems that disturb the normal homeostatic state [ 28-30]. Fluctuations in these 
networks can result from genetic or epi[INVESTIGATOR_59320]/or changes in the molecular 
constitution of the tumor microenvironment, which collectively dictate the phenotype of the 
biological system. The molecular networks engaged during tumor development and/or 
progression are complex. Molecular networks have evolved to provide the ultimate level of 
cellular plasticity, allowing cells to adapt to or exploit extracellular cues within the local milieu 
[31]. The complexity of a tumor system is further exaggerated by [CONTACT_59514], which leads to an accelerated micro -evolutionary process that results in 
further cellular and tumor sub- system heterogeneity [ 32, 33]. This variability combined with the 
adaptability of many molecular pathways provides a somewhat predictable and highly probable path to resistance for any given agent that targets a subset of cellular systems within a tumor’s 
molecular and genetic repertoire [ 34]. A fundamental challenge in the area of targeted cancer 
treatment is how to identify optimal therapeutic combinations that can treat heterogeneous tumors that are both highly adaptive and that exhibit significant inter - and intra -patient variation [ 28, 35-
37]. Our proposal outlines an approach by [CONTACT_59515] a growing pharmacopeia [38, 39] in 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210825] likely to respond to a specific therapy. For 
example, activation of the ALK gene through sequence variation mutations has been identified in 
a subset of neuroblastoma patients, and small -molecule inhibition of the ALK -encoded receptor 
tyrosine kinase caused cytotoxicity in affected neuroblastoma cell lines [ 40]. Such studies, in 
conjunction with a large body of in vitro and in vivo data, have further demonstrated that the 
efficacy of specific treatment modalities is dependent upon the molecular constitution of the 
tumor, and that the observed variations in tumor response to current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59322].  
 
While individual biomarkers may be predictive of responses to specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], especially in 
the context of front -line treatment, a different approach to the management of patients with 
refractory disease is needed in order to identify effective treatments from the catalog of available 
agents. Advances in informatics and molecular technologies, coupled with our expanding 
knowledge of molecular networks and mechanism of action of the existing pharmacopeia, 
provide a great opportunity in translational medicine to develop a model that more accurately 
predicts tumor response. The studies outlined in this proposal are a step in the development of 
personalized oncology, in which each patient is truly treated individually based upon the 
systematic molecular analysis of their disease. Our project is focused on testing the merits of a 
specific data- driven predictive method through which any number of drugs in our current 
knowledge base has a chance of being recommended, of these only the FDA approved drugs 
listed in Appendix III will be used. Although this novel approach to personalized therapeutics 
brings with it to the concern that toxicities that may arise from novel combinations of agents, it is 
strongly felt by [CONTACT_59516] a committee 
of highly qualified physicians and pharmacist s in order to identify drug candidates for 
consideration in the treatment of a patient population with few alternative options is a worthwhile 
endeavor. The systematic biomarker -driven approach outlined in this proposal, by [CONTACT_59517] a 
combination of drugs targeting the specific molecular composition of a tumor —irrespective of 
tumor classification or anatomical origin — provides a feasible alternative to the conventional 
approach that targets specific organs or tissues without consideration of the underlying tumor 
biology.  
 
 
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_59331] -Guided Therapy in Patients with 
Refractory or Recurrent Neuroblastoma.  
 
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_59332] -wide mRNA expression profiles of neuroblastoma tumor biopsies to 
make real -time treatment decisions.  Feasibility was defined as the completion of the following in 
a two week time period: tumor biopsy, quality RNA extraction, mRNA U133 2+ Affymetrix gene chip hybridization, analysis utilizing a series of predictive meth odologies, report generation, 
tumor board review with formulated treatment plan, and medical monitor review.  Subjects were 
not treated on this study.  There were [ADDRESS_1210826] s had soft tissue disease which 
was able to be biopsied. All biopsies were adequate by [CONTACT_59518] (>75% viable tumor) 
and RNA quality (>6.5 RIN). Gene chips were completed in 3- [ADDRESS_1210827] s. Correlative biology specimens were obtained and grown in culture. 
Mice xenografts of 3 /[ADDRESS_1210828] s were establ ished. Cultures and xenografts are able to be  used for 
validation studies of predicted drug sensitivity.  In conclusion i t is feasible to obtain real- time 
genomic profiling for molecularly guided therapy for use in treatment decision making.  
 
 
A Feasibility Trial using Molecular -Guided Therapy in Patients with Refractory or 
Recurrent Neuroblastoma.  
 
The primary objective of this feasibility  study was to evaluate the feasibility  and safety  of using 
predictive modeling based on genome -wide mRNA expression profiles of neuroblastoma tumor 
biopsies to make real -time treatment decisions.  Feasibility was defined as “enrollment onto 
study, quality mRNA obtained, gene chip completed, tumor board held, medical monitor review 
and approval, start of treatment by [ADDRESS_1210829] biopsy/surgical resection date, and completion of 
1 cycle of therapy.” Sixteen (16)  subjects were enrolled to this study, all with multiply relapsed or 
refractory neuroblastoma. Subjects were between [ADDRESS_1210830] diagnosis. All subjects had soft 
tissue disease which was able to be biopsied. All biopsies were adequate by [CONTACT_59518] 
(>75% viable tumor) and RNA quality (>6.5 RIN). 2 subjects were deemed ineligible due to 
tumor type after biopsy. Gene chips were completed in 3 -8 days (95% CI: 3.8 –  6.8), report 
generation took 0- 3 days (95% CI: 0.0 – 1.5), tumor board took 1- 6 days (95% CI: 1.6 – 4.2), 
medical monitor sign off took 1- 2 days (95% CI: 0.8 –  1.4). The total time from date of biopsy to 
tumor board was 6- 11 days (95% CI: 7.5 –  10.2) for all subjects and 7- 20 days to treatment (95% 
CI: 8.9 –  16.1) , with an average of 12.[ADDRESS_1210831] was able to create 
individualized therapy regimens for all subjects. Correlative biology specime ns were obtained 
and grown in culture. Mice xenograft establishment is ongoing. Cultures and xenografts are able 
to be used for validation studies of predicted drug sensitivity. Triplicate biopsies showed 
reproducible sets of drugs and the comparatively large differences in drug lists between patients 
show that the drug lists are tailored to patients. Comparison of RNA expression profiles with 
RNA sequencing from each patient showed strong correlation.  
 
The study endpoint show ed that 14/[ADDRESS_1210832] (this is not usually present at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59333]) and will continue to be incorporated in this and future trials.   
All patients tolerated therapy well and were treated without any serious adverse events related to 
study drugs.  Clinical benefit was seen 64% of patients.   This study shows that it is feasible to 
create therapeutic treatment plans based on genomic profiling in real time and that patients are able to be treated safely on a tumor board derived molecular guided therapy using existing 
medications  
 
 
In this study w e proposed to study reproducibility by [CONTACT_867947]. The primary goal of the reproducibility study is to evaluate the variation among sets of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_867928]. Secondary goals are 1) 
to compare the variation among sets of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_867929]009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210833] patients and 2) to evaluate variation associated with earlier steps in 
the process, in particular, expression profiles and comparative expression profiles.  
   
  
Distance- based nonparametric multivariate 
analysis of variance [41, 42]  allowed us to reject the null hypothesis that variation between 
biopsies can be accounted for by [CONTACT_59523] (p=0.001). That the variation 
among expression profiles associated with the same biopsy is small compared with the variation 
between expression profiles associated with different biopsies is apparent from Princi pal 
Component Analysis (Figure 1).  
 Sets of drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_59336], the variation among drug sets associated with the same biopsy is small compared with 
the variation among drug lists associated with different biopsies (p=0.001). The reproducibility 
averaged over patients, replicates, and drugs is 0.68.  As the threshold score increases the reproducibility increases to 1 (Figure  2). 
 A Feasibility Trial using Molecular -Guided Therapy in Patients with Relapsed and 
Refractory Childhood Cancer.  
 The primary objective of this study was  to determine feasibility of using tumor samples to  assess 
genomic mRNA expression arrays and DNA Mutation Panels using predictive modeling to make real-time treatment decisions for children with relapsed/refractory cancers.   Feasibility was 
defined as “enrollment onto study, RNA expression profile completed, DNA Mutation Panel

Conclusion  
Collectively, the early preclinical and current  clinical data suggests that this integrated approach 
is highly feasible  and safe in pediatric cancers  and that it is reproducible among repeat samples 
within patients.  Based upon the significant need for a more rational -based approach to therapeutic 
select ion in these difficult to treat pediatric tumors  continued development of this approach is 
warranted . The area of genomic analysis is advancing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_867930]. We have adapted our analysis 
to move from RNA expression profiling to RNA sequencing and DNA mutation panel to DNA 
exomes. This will be evaluated in this study for use by [CONTACT_867948].

of the tumor tissue biopsy will be shipped overnight to the Sholler  Pediatric Oncology 
Translational Research Laboratory  on dry ice.  
 Upon arr ival of the tumor specimens at Ashion  and the Sholler Pediatric Oncology Translational 
Research Laboratory , the samples will be logged and immediately processed according to details 
in Section 9 . 
2.4 DNA and RNA Sequencing  
 
Sequencing for this study will be performed at Ashion Analytics, LLC (Ashion).  Ashion is a 
CLIA -certified laboratory developed by [CONTACT_867951] a clinical laboratory to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and quality of the data. The 
sequencing will be performed on the Illumina HiSeq [ADDRESS_1210837] will be created and the tumor and blood samples for the patient will be given a sample identifier and stored in the NMTRC laboratory management 
database (LIMS). The samples, tagged with the LIMS sample identifier, will then be sent to the 
CLIA laboratory in Phoenix, A Z.  Once there, whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing 
will be performed on the tumor sample. Whole exome sequencing will also be performed on a blood sample from the patient. For exome sequencing, fastq files are aligned with BWA 0.6.2 to 
GRCh37.62 and the SAM output are converted to a sorted BAM file using samtools 0.1.18. BAM 
files are subjected to indel realignment, mark duplicates, and recalibration steps in this order with GATK 2.2 where dpsnp135 is used for known SNPs and 1000 Genomes’ 
ALL.wgs.low_coverage_vqsr.[ADDRESS_1210838] of these 
files is a VCF file that specifies the variants that were observed in the tumor sample. The second 
file is an FPKM file that specifies the expression levels of genes in the tumor sample. Both of 
these files will be in the VCF 4.1 format -  an example of the VCF 4.1 format for expression is 
shown in the appendix.  At the completion of the whole exome sequencing, a single file VCF file 
containing the variants for the tumor sample and identifying them as either somatic or germ line 
by [CONTACT_867952]. The tumor variants will be in VCF4.1 spec 
generated by [CONTACT_867953] 2.5.  An example of a variant (for the V600E mutation of BRAF) is shown in 
the appendix below where AR is allele ratio, DP1 is depth of normal, DP2 is depth of tumor, LN1 
is length.  The effect of the variant is extracted with the following regular expressions, regex is 
EFF=/ \((.*)\ )/.

Issued 10 January 2017  Patient data captured on the Ashion  server is encrypted and pushed via a file transfer server  (FTP)  
for secure delivery of data to authorized NMTRC study personnel. The LIMS system contains a 
file detection system that will identify when samples are made available on the FTP site. These 
files, tagged with the sample identifiers will be pulled from the FTP site and imported into the 
LIMS system. The LIMS system will then process the three files into a personalized medicine 
report as described in the algorithms section.  
 
2.5 NMTRC Drug prediction report  
 
The following describes  the NMTRC report generation  which utilizes data generated from 
Ashion  (as described in section 2.4  above).  
 
 
Predicted Therapeutic Compounds:  At this time, there are currently greater than [ADDRESS_1210839] variant/drug matching  
2. Inferred variant/drug matching  
3. Expression of biomarkers/drug targets (biomarker expression)  
The algorithms are described in detail below. Although there will not be formal ranking of the 
drug calls, there are different levels of confidence in the three algorithms and as such, the drugs 
will be listed in the report in the order of the confidence in the algorithms that identified them as 
candidate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_867931] (Direct variant first, followed by [CONTACT_867954], followed by 
[CONTACT_867955]). This is because sequence variants (whether direct or inferred) provide stronger evidence of tumor dependence than simple gene expression calls, with direct 
drug/variant relationships being the highest confidence of all three.  Within the biomarker 
expression, the drugs will be listed in descending order from most to least differentially 
expressed.  
 
Variant drug matching  
 
The NMTRC LIMS system has a database that contains a table linking drugs, variants, and genes 
with evidence from peer reviewed literature. The patient's tumor variants from the VCF files 
produced by [CONTACT_867956][INVESTIGATOR_014]. This matching provides the output for direct variant/drug matching and inferred variant 
drug/matching. The inferred and direct refer to the strength of the evidence supporting the 
relationship between the drug and the variant. The first level of confidence, direct evidence 
indicates that the literature indicates that 1) the variant has been directly associated with a change in response to the therapy (either becoming more sensitive or more resistant) and the gene is the 
target of the drug or 2) the variant has been directly shown to activate the pathway for which the 
drug is a target or 3) the variant has been associated with changes in response to the drug due to 
indirect mechanism including but not limited to transportation or metabolism. Evidence of direct 
activation of the drug target by [CONTACT_867957] a sensitivity indicator, unless there is 
specific evidence that the variant induces resistance to the drug. The second level of confidence, 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210840] be a somatic mutation (present in the tumor only) and also have a minor allele 
frequence from the [ADDRESS_1210841] which is less than 0.5%.Whether the evidence is direct 
or inferred will be indicated by a column in the report. The evidence that resulted in the drug selection will be provided as a hyperlink in the table.  
 Biomarker Expression  
 The third algorithm utilizes the gene expression as measured by [CONTACT_867958]. A consistent step for 
the NMTRC methodologies outlined in this proposal is the conversion of normalized probe set 
intensities to a relative measure of transcript abundance.  We utilize a standardized z- score 
method (described below in Signal Pre -Preprocessing and Z -Score Calculation) to determine 
statistically significant differences in each sample relative to a whole body reference and relative to cancer reference.  This method assigns a z- score to each probe set based upon the number of 
standard deviations from the normal sample population mean.  This provides a good assessment 
of transcript “differences” relative to a whole body reference or cancer reference sets which may 
not necessarily be associated with large fold changes in transcript expression. Having established a consistent data input of relative transcript abundance in each subject ’s tumor specimen, the 
following analytical methods will be applied to the standardized data to predict drug efficacy.  
 The method is fundamentally very straightforward. There are two classes of expression rules. The first of these rules are biomarker rules and are of the type “ overexpression of gene g1 implies 
sensitivity (or insensitivity) to drug d1” or “underexpression of gene g2 implies sensitivity (or 
insensitivity) to drug d2” whereas the second is “g3 is the target of drug d3, thus overexpression of g3 implies sensitivity to d3 ”. The NMTRC LIMS contains a database of drugs and the genes 
along with a column that implies whether over or under expression of that gene indicates 
sensitivity (or insensitivity)  to the drug and the evidence for that rule. In order for a gene to be 
called over or underexpressed a method is required to identify calls. This is described in more 
detail in the next section.  
Gene expression calls  
 
Two distinct perspectives are consistent with using over - or underexpression to guide therapy but 
suggest different sets of reference samples and different statistical tests. If gene expression level 
is interpreted to reflect sensitivity of a cell to a drug then elevated (alternatively, depressed) 
expression should be anomalous  by [CONTACT_867959] (the whole 
body normal reference). The drug should then kill the tumor cells before it kills normal cells. We call elevated (depressed) expression relative to samples of the whole body N ormal Reference 
using a standard score ( Z-score), referred to as the NRZ.  
In contrast, if gene expression level in a cancer cell is interpreted as reflecting comparative drug sensitivity among cancer cells then elevated expression should be called based on its rank among 
other cancer samples (the cancer reference). We call elevated (alternatively, depressed) 
expression relative to the Cancer Reference based on the C umulative distribution, referred to as 
the CRC statistic.  
We report indications based on both the NRZ and CRC, based on only the NRZ, and based on 
only the CRC. For each such indication we report both the NRZ and the CRC.

deviation of 𝑋𝑋. The NRZ is consistent with the statistic we used previously for microarray -based 
expression measurements. We use a threshold of 2, that is, NRZ> 2 indicates overexpression NRZ 
< -2 indicates underexpression. The normal reference set comprises 42 normal tissues, organized 
into 21 tissue types: Adrenal Gland, Brain, Bronchus, Corpus uteri, Corpus Uteri, Esophagus, 
Gland, Heart, Large Intestine, Liver, Lymph Node, Nipple, Prostate Gland, Salivary Gland, 
Skeletal Muscle, Skin, Small Intestine, Spleen, Testis, Tonsil, Uterus. Many (28) of the samples are also given a sub -type designation, for example, Brain: Hippocampus .

from case 𝑖𝑖  , and 𝑠𝑠𝐶𝐶 is the sample standard deviation, obtained from 𝐶𝐶. CRC estimates the 
proportion of cancer samples that are less extreme than the query, that is, a higher CRC indicates 
more strongly for treatment based on the rule. For example, with an overexpression rule, CRC = [ADDRESS_1210842] chosen to call samples that are in the top quartile 
(CRC>0.75) as elevated or depressed in expression.  We also identify genes support by [CONTACT_867961] > 2 and CRC > 0.5.  
In contrast to the use of the use of the NRZ, with which the objective is to call anomalous 
expression, comparison with the cancer reference requires estimating the quantile associated with 𝑋𝑋
𝑞𝑞. The proportion of cancer samples that express a gene at a level below the query sample might 
be estimated using the empi[INVESTIGATOR_173824], for example, in the case of 
overexpression 
𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖∈𝐶𝐶�𝑋𝑋𝑞𝑞>𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖�. 
However, variation arises as a result of biological differences between tumors and as a result of 
differences in observations of the same tumor. If all tumors were biologically identical with 
respect to expression of a gene then quantiles would reflect exclusively the observation and 
variation would not be relevant.   Since our cancer reference set includes samples representing pediatric oncology tumors  we can estimate the variation within  cancer case and therefore estimate 
the proportion of cancer cases for which expression of the gene falls significantly below (overexpression) or above (underexpression) the query.

criteria for an inferred indicator of drug response (described in the algorithms section) it will 
generate a line in the report which indicates that the relationship between the drug and gene is 
inferred. For each differentially expressed biomarker indicating/not indicating, a line will 
be generated in the report. For all rows in the report there will be a link to the PubMed article that 
supports the identified aberration/drug relationship. The set of rules will be in a read only 
database that will be inaccessible for changes during the trial.  
The software has been validated to show that:

2. Simple yet sophisticated rules management.   
3. Cross reference data with several open source data sets.  
4. Generation of a clinically understandable, actionable report.  
Positive mutation findings from the whole exome and RNA sequencing will be verified using Sanger Sequencing. While all attempts will be made to have this data available to the tumor board, due to the potential length of time to process Sanger Sequencing samples, these results 
may not be available until after the tumor board has met and the patient has started protocol 
treatment. If Sanger Sequencing results differ from the original sequencing, the results and the

[ADDRESS_1210844] ’s tumor. The molecular tumor board consists of pediatric 
oncologists, pharmacists, bioinformations, genomicists, and pathologists  (as available).   Specific 
treatment details will consist of a regimen chosen from a guided list of agents implicated in 
critica l molecular signaling pathways  summarized in the guided therapy report s and may include 
one standard chemotherapy agent  not included on the report . All agents are listed in the current 
FDA approved pharmacopoeia  with age appropriate dosing, but will differ amongst individual

approved and over the counter medications  predicted by [CONTACT_867962]. For the se panel s the analytical methods

toxicities the following databases will be used: MicroMedex LexiComp, Facts and 
Comparisons , Natural Medicines Database.  
Subject s’ history and previously received treatments will be reviewed. Drugs which a subject  
has failed will be given low priority and used only if there is a rationale for synergy in 
combination therapy.  
3.1.2 Recommended  priorities for determining drug dosing to be used in individualized 
treatment plans include the following:  
1. For a given proposed individualized combination of drugs the first priority to establish 
doses will be to identify the same combination of drugs in a peer -reviewed journal article 
or presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an ongoing peer -reviewed clinical 
trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  
2. When a proposed individualized combination of drugs has not previously been reported, 
the process to establish doses will be to then identify individual members of the proposed 
combination that have been used in combination with other cytotoxic agents similar to 
those being considered for combination therapy. The source of information will be a 
peer-reviewed journal article or presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an 
ongoing peer -reviewed clinical trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  
3. When a proposed individualized combination of drugs have no available combination 
data, dosing guidelines will start with the MTD determined from a phase I/II pediatric 
study.  Reference information will be based upon either a peer -reviewed journal article or 
presented as a reviewed abstract, or which is part of an ongoing peer -reviewed clinical 
trial registered with clinical trials.gov.  Doses will be reduced to compensate for potential 
additive toxicities of combination agent s.  
Please note that many of the drugs that will be considered for proposed individualized combination therapy in this protocol are not considered cytotoxic agents and therefore will not have previously been specifically tested as part of conventional antineoplastic protocols. 
Examples of these medications may include anti -seizure or anti -cholesterol agents. These non-
cytotoxic agents will be used at standard doses based on recommendations of an experienced pediatric pharmacis t and described pharmacy programs that are used to evaluate potential 
interactions and combina tion dosing for all medications . The final treatment regimen  will be 
subjected to a [ADDRESS_1210846]  and their

7.3 Response Criteria  
Overall response rate (ORR) in subject s with radiologically assessable disease will be determined 
by [CONTACT_59548] -sectional imaging, MIBG /PET  scans, and/or bone marrow assessment.  
Response Assessment:  Each subject will be classified according to their “best response” for the 
purposes of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the objective statuses described below.  
Response Criteria for Subjects with Solid Tumors:  This study will use the (RECIST) 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (version 1.1) from the NCI [44]. Key points are that 
a maximum of [ADDRESS_1210871] diameter (uni -
dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
• Measurable disease:  The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension with the longest diameter at least 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). The investigator will identify up to [ADDRESS_1210872] demonstrate clear evidence of progression to 
be considered measurable.  
• Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with CT or MRI, using the same method of 
assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and 
during follow -up. 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 43 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  • Quantification of Disease Burden The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions 
will be calculated and reported as the disease measurement.   
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target and non- target lesions. 
• Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Greater than 90% decrease of the disease 
measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry. Non -target CT/MRI lesions stable to smaller in 
size. 
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study enrollment. No new lesions or progression of any non- target measurable lesion.  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD from study entry.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements 
for measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment (nadir), and minimum [ADDRESS_1210873] s with Bone Marrow Disease:  
• Those subject s with morphologic evidence of disease by [CONTACT_59549] H and E staining (NSE 
staining only is not evaluable) will be evaluable to assess bone marrow response.  
• Complete response: No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_631084][INVESTIGATOR_59345].  
• Progressive disease: Tumor seen on morphology on two consecutive bone marrows done at 
least three weeks apart in subject s who had NO tumor in bone marrow at study entry. (Note: 
Subject  may be declared as progressive disease in bone marrow after only one diagnostic bone 
marrow at the discretion of the treating physician after discussion with the study chair.)  
• Stable disease : Persistence of an amount of tumor in the bone marrow by [CONTACT_59551].  
 
Response Criteria for Subject s with MIBG or PET  Positive Lesions  
• Subject s who have a positive MIBG or PET scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for 
MIBG or PET  response. All MIBG’s  and PET scans  will be performed at the research 
institution and then centrally reviewed.  
• Complete response = complete resolution of all positive lesions  
• Partial response = resolution of at least one positive lesion, with persistence of other MIBG 
positive lesions.  
• Stable disease = no change in scan in number of positive lesions (includes subject s who have 
same number of positive lesions but decreased intensity)  
• Progressive disease = Development of new positive lesions  
 The intensity of MIBG uptake is not to be considered in the above institutional evaluation.  
Duration of response : 
Duration of response is defined as the period of time from when measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whichever is first recorded, until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The assessment of response will include the initial measurable targets and will be performed after 
the second cycle, then after every other cycle (or [ADDRESS_1210874]). Serial results 
of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], biopsies and urinary catecholamines will be reviewed for responding 
subject s to confirm response or lack of progression.   
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210875] stable disease or better and  a 
decrease in their tumor markers by ≥ 50%. Clinical response will also be defined as a subject that 
has a complete clearing of a previously positive bone marrow while on study.  
Progression Free Survival  
Time to progression, defined as the period from the first day of administration of study drug until the criteria for progression are met taking as reference the screening measurements, will be assessed.   
 
8 Sample Size Justification  
 
Feasibility  
Since this is primarily a feasibility trial, the definition of feasibility for this study will include:  
 “Enrollment onto study, genomic profile, analysis and report generation completed, tumor board held with treatment decision, treatment review completed, start of treatment, and 
completion of 1 cycle of therapy .” 
 
Our preliminary results for [ADDRESS_1210876] a sample collection success rate of 
5/5 (100%) subject s, a genetic report profile success rate of 5/5 (100%) within the 7- 10 day time 
window as well as a treatment agreement success rate of 5/5 (100%) within the 5 day time window.  The average time (+/ -SD) for completion of the genetic profile was 6.6 days (+/ -1.7 
days) with a median of 7 days.   The average time (+/ -SD) for time to Treatment was 3.2 days (+/ -
0.8 days) with a median of 3 days.   Data preliminary to date for each of these three feasibility 
markers are very consistent with our anticipated performance standards.   
  
Our initial feasibility trial continues to show that it is feasible and safe to use RNA expression 
analysis and a DNA mutation panel for tumor boards creating treatment decisions for patients 
without curative options. This study will ask the feasibility of utilizing  DNA exomes and RNA 
sequencing in a tumor for molecular guided therapy. 
 
 Assumptions :  The feasibility o utcome is a binary measure for each of the three clinical strata 
with a lower success null value of 50% which would require reconsideration of the full process and an upper success value of 75% for the alternative which would be deemed worthy of further 
consideration for an efficacy trial at the next phase. A binomial distribution was used for the 
testing process with a combination of Type I error levels (10%) and Power (75 %).  The  basic 
design overall is a MiniM ax approach which minimizes the overall sample size. The MiniMax  
design with an interim look will require an overall sample size of n = 16 .  Each of the three 
clinical strata will use a two -stage decision rule.  
 
The Two -Stage Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59346]:  
 Stage 1: Stop and accept the null hypothesis if the observed feasibility rate is less than or equal to 
5/9.  Otherwise, continue to stage 2.  
 The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10036] 0. 746 when Ho is true and 0.166 when Ha is true.  
 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 45 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  Stage 2: Stop and accept the null hypothesis if the observed feasibility rate is less than or equal to 
10/16.  Otherwise, stop and reject the null hypothesis.  
 
As of Amendment 3.0, [ADDRESS_1210877] been met.   To gain additional feasibility with the new Drug Prediction Report and additional 
safety and efficacy data, additional subjects will be enrolled to meet a revised goal of 200 total 
evaluable subjects.  
 The expanded access for 100 patients will enroll following implementation of Amendment 
3.0.  Their tumor samples will be analyzed using an updated Drug Prediction Report (Appendix 
III).  Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) for this group will be 
compared to those of the first 100 patients who received treatment based upon the original Drug Prediciton Report and Pharmacopeia Library.  
 
9 Laboratory Evaluations  
9.1 Specimens to be Collected, Schedule and Amount  
Required samples will be collected at the start of study. Recommended /Secondary  
(volunteer /optional ) samples  will also be collected  at the start of study. Additionally,  optional 
bone marrow samples will  be collected  every 6-[ADDRESS_1210878] ’s study number , date of 
extraction and sample contents . If excess tissue is available, then snap frozen tumor tissue 
approximately 5mm in size should be wrapped in foil, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC. Tissue samples will be coded. Fixed tissue remaining from diagnostic evaluation may be 
used.  Bone marrow samples will also be sent to the 
Pediatric Oncology Translational 
Research Laboratory for tumor cell isolation and culture . 
 
At the  Pediatric Oncology Translational  Research Laboratory  tumor cells will be grown to 70% 
confluency in cell growth media . Cell lines will be maintained in culture for biology studies. 
These will include determining the growth curves and responsiveness of cells derived from these 
tumors to a variety of agents identified on the report in vitro  (both the chosen regimen as well as 
alternate options). Cells will be injected into the inguinal fat pad of NOD SCID mice for 
generation of subject  xenografts. These mice will be used for correlative drug testing experiments 
based on predictive models. Evaluation of mechanism of action of new drug combinations will be evaluated in mice models and in cell culture through immunohistochemical staining , 
phosphoproteomics , PCR , and western blotting. These models will allow us the opportunity to 
evaluate alternate drug combinations that might have been superior to the chosen regimen.

potential subject  will undergo consent and completion of all required screening procedures and 
certification of all inclusion and exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_737].  If the subject  fits all 
enrollment criteria, the site will again contact [CONTACT_867964],  Ashion,  Spectrum Health, and the Pediatric Oncology Translational Research Laboratory 
in preparation for collection and processing of tissue sample. The research coordinator at 
NMTRC  will organize the convening of members of the tumor board for discussion of the current 
case once the full report is available. In addition, a study enrollment form will be faxed to the 
coordinator at  NMTRC , a unique subject  identifier will be assigned and the enrollment form will 
be sent back to the participating site. The NMTRC will contact [CONTACT_59556] e -mail if the study 
enrollment is on hold or closed at any time.  
 Subject  samples will be collected at each institution and follow the flow chart above.  Once the 
report s are generated they will be sent to NMTRC/ [CONTACT_59647].  The Principal Investigator

unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
An untoward medical event which occurs outside the period of follow -up as defined in the 
protocol will not be considered an adverse event unless related to study drug.  Worsening of a 
medical condition for which the efficacy of the study drug is being evaluated will not be 
considered an adverse event.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1210895] medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)  
• Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
• Results in  a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59358].  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of an event; the event itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This is not the same 
as “serious”, which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning.

All adverse events, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents and Grade 3 
or higher (per CTCAE 4.0) related and unexpected adverse events that occur while on study 
should be captured on the adverse event case report form.  All Baseline AE’s will be captured on 
a separate baseline Adverse event case report form. All Grade [ADDRESS_1210897] 
be captured.  
 Information to be reported in the description of each adverse event includes:  
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded)  
• The date of onset of the event and relatedness to treatment regimen.  
• The date of resolution of the event and whether the event is serious or not  
• Action taken; drug treatment required; non- drug treatment required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59359]; diagnostic procedure performed; subject

10.1.6  Grading and Relatedness of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Grading of Severity of an Adverse Event  
Each adverse event (Grade 2 or higher) will be graded for severity per the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V 4.0), and these criteria 
must be used in grading the severity of adverse events.  The criteria can be found at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 
Grading of Severity of an Adverse Event Not Listed in Published Criteria:  
For those adverse events which are not listed as part of the NCI CTCAE V 4 .0, the same grading 
system should be used, where:  
• Mild corresponds to an event not resulting in disability or incapacity and which resolves 
without intervention  
• Moderate corresponds to an event not resulting in disability or incapacity but which 
requires intervention  
• Severe corresponds to an event resulting in temporary disability or incapacity and which 
requires intervention  
• Life-threatening  corresponds to an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the 
time of the event  
• Fatal  corresponds to an event that results in the death of the subject

Version 3.0 FINAL  Page 55 of 70 Confidential  
Issued 10 January 2017  [IP_ADDRESS] Relatedness to Study Drug  
The Investigator must attempt to determine if an adverse event is in some way related to the use 
of the study drug and define an attribution category. This relationship should be described as 
follows:  
 
RELATIONSHIP  ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated to 
investigational 
agent/intervention  
 Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the 
intervention.  
The event is clearly due to causes distinct from the use of 
the study drug, such as a documented pre -existing 
condition, the effect of a concomitant medication, or a new 
condition which, based on the pathophysiology of the 
condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would 
be unrelated to the use of the study drug . 
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention.  
Adverse event does not have temporal  relationship to 
intervention,  could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, could have been due to environmental or other interventions, does not follow 
known pattern of response to intervention, does not 
reappear or worsen with reintroduction of intervention . 
Related to 
investigational 
agent/intervention  
 Possible  The AE may be related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug and the event follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug BUT the event 
could have been produced by [CONTACT_241803], based on the pathophysiology of the 
condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would 
be unlikely related to the use of the study drug OR the 
event could be the effect of a concomitant medication . 
Probable  The AE is likely related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, the event follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug AND the event 
cannot have been reasonably explained by [CONTACT_867965] a 
concomitant medication . 
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the intervention.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug, the event follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug and based on the 
known pharmacology of the study drug, the event is 
clearly related to the effect of the study drug.  The adverse 
event improves upon discontinuation of the study drug and 
reappears upon repeat exposure.  
 
 
 
 
Clinical Protocol NMTRC009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210901] Off -Therapy  
Subjects will be removed  from the study therapy for the following reasons:  
• Subject completes p rotocol defined therapy (a minimum of one cycle)  
• Progressive neoplastic disease 
• Subject  or guardian withdraws consent to continue in the trial  
• Subject  develops an intercurrent illness that precludes further participation, or requires a 
prohibited concomitant treatment  
• The Investigator withdraws the subject  in the subject ’s best interests  
• Subject  is lost to follow -up (defined as the inability to contact [CONTACT_59561] 3 separate 
occasions over a period of 2 weeks)  
• Administrative reasons (e.g., the subject  is transferred to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677])  
• An adverse event, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], precludes further trial 
participation or fulfills the protocol requirements for withdrawal  
• Death  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1210902] Off -Study  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study completely which includes withdrawal from survival follow -up for the following reasons:  
• Completion of all study requirements  
• Subject or guardian withdraws consent to continue in the trial  (if this occurs, no further 
study visits or data may be collected)  
• Subject is lost to follow -up (defined as the inability to contact [CONTACT_1175] 3 separate 
occasions over a period of 2 weeks)  
• Death  
 
11.3 Trial Discontinuation   
The Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (NMTRC) may 
discontinue the trial as a whole or at an individual investigational site at any time. Reasons for 
early trial discontinuation may include, but are not limited to, unacceptable toxicity of 
treatment regimens, a request to discontinue the trial from a regulatory authority, protocol 
violations at an investigational site, violations of good clinical practice at an investigational 
site, or poor enrollment. The NMTRC  will promptly inform all Investigators in the event of 
premature study discontinuation and provide all Investigators with instructions regarding the 
disposition of subject s still on study. Should the study be terminated prematurely, all case 
report forms and any other study material will be returned to the NMTRC .  
 
[ADDRESS_1210903] (DSMB)   
An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the conduct of the study. The members of this Board will receive database summaries, including adverse event 
reports, and will convene either in person or via teleconference according to section 3.[ADDRESS_1210904] will be responsible for decisions regarding possible termination and/or early reporti ng of 
the study.  
12.[ADDRESS_1210905] deviations, and 95% confidence intervals.  The total time duration to treatment initiation and time to completion of the first cycle of treatment will also be 
examined using Kaplan- Meier plots since some patients who are considered process failures or 
who do not complete the full duration to the completion of the first cycle of treatment may 
contribute censored data.  The formal hypothesis testing of the feasibility or success is based upon the 2 -stage Mini -Max testing process outlined in Section 8: Sample Size Justification.   Further 
quantification of the feasibility success rate will be based upon the percentage of the n = [ADDRESS_1210906] 95% confidence interval using a Binomial distribution model due 
to the small sample size involved.  
12.4 Secondary Data Analysis  
Overall response rates (ORR) will be examined using rates for each of the clinical response 
categories supplemented using exact 95% confidence intervals.  Progression free survival (PFS) data for each of the three clinical strata will be examined using Kaplan -Meier time to event plots.  
Differences in the PFS for the current treatment protocol with historical PFS values will be 
explored using Cox proportional hazard rate methods when possible.  Patients that enroll through 
compassionate access will be included in secondary data analysis.  
 
[ADDRESS_1210907] ’s legal representative 
has given written informed consent. The NMTRC  will provide the site Investigators with a 
sample informed consent document that conforms to all the requirements for informed consent 
according to ICH GCP and US FDA guidelines (21 CFR 50). However, it is up to each site 
Investigator to provide a final informed consent that may include additional elements required by 
[CONTACT_737]’s institution or local regulatory authorities. The IRB/EC for each investigational 
site must approve the consent form document prior to study activation; changes to the consent 
form during the course of the study may also require IRB/EC approval. The informed consent 
document must clearly describe the potential risks and benefits of the trial, and each prospective 
participant must be given adequate time to discuss the trial with the Investigator or site staff and 
to decide whether or not to participate. Each subject  who agrees to participate in the trial and who 
signs the informed consent will be given a copy of the signed dated and witnessed document. The 
original copy of the signed  dated and witnessed informed consent document will be retained by 
[CONTACT_867966]009  
 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1210908]  to use and/or disclose protected 
health information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA). Written HIPAA authorization may be obtained as part of the informed consent process.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1210909] of the Study and IRB/IEC Approval   
The study will be conducted according to the principles of the [ADDRESS_1210910] s about the trial to the local IRB/IEC for approval prior to enrolling any subject  
into the trial. The IRB/IEC should be duly constituted according to applicable regulatory 
requirements. Approval must be in the form of a letter signed by [CONTACT_59563]/IEC 
or the Chairperson’s designee, must be on IRB/IEC stationary and must include the protocol by 
[CONTACT_59564]/or designated number. If an Investigator is a member of the IRB/IEC, the approval 
letter must stipulate that the Investigator did not participate in the final vote, although the 
Investigator may participate in the discussion of the trial. The Investigator will also inform the 
IRB/IEC of any serious adverse events that are reported to regulatory authorities and will provide 
to the IRB/IEC a final summary of the results of the trial at the conclusion of the trial.  
 
Any amendments to the protocol will be done through the NMTRC , and will be submitted to the 
coordinating IRB/IEC for review and written approval before implementation.  
 
13.3 Monitoring   
An independent study monitor will make regularly scheduled trips to the investigational site to 
review the progress of the trial. The actual frequency of monitoring trips will depend on the 
enrollment rate and performance at each site. At each visit, the monitor will review various 
aspects of the trial including, but not limited to, screening and enrollment logs; compliance with 
the protocol and with the principles of Good Clinical Practice; completion of case report forms; 
source data verification; facilities and staff.  
 
During scheduled monitoring visits, the Investigator and the investigational site staff must be 
available to meet with the study monitor in order to discuss the progress of the trial, make 
necessary corrections to case report form entries, respond to data clarification requests and 
respond to any other trial -related inquiries of the monitor.  
 
In addition to the above, representatives of the NMTRC  or government inspectors may review the 
conduct/results of the trial at the investigational site. The Investigator at each site must promptly 
notify the NMTRC  of any audit requests by [CONTACT_12721].  
 
A separate monitoring plan will be provided for additional monitoring guidelines.

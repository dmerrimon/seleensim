Single -site, randomized, single -blind, placebo -controlled, trial  
 
8.0  INTERVENTION  
Subjects will identify the location of pain on their back. A member of the study team will 
note the location on a drawing. The TCMS device will be placed at the site the patient 
 
TCMS Protocol Version: 1.0  
Page 4 of 17 identified. (Low back pain is defined as pain below the costal margin posterio rly, 
extending as low as the upper buttocks.)  
 
With only a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563925], the clinician will place the active or sham TCMS 
device on the area of pain, turn the device on, and adjust the amplitude upward from 
0.24T in increments of 10%, approxi mately every [ADDRESS_740862] as necessary to maintain patient comfort.  
 
 
Treatment group: TCMS device set to 1.2  Tesla will deliver a dose of 10 pulses per 
minute for 9 minutes (total 90 pulses).  The first minute will be dedicated to adjusting 
the amplitude until maximum is achieved and/or the subject reports a sensation.  
 
Placebo group:  the sham TCMS device will remain on the area of pain for [ADDRESS_740863] minute will be dedicated to adjusting the  “sham”  amplitude. The 
remaining 9 minutes will be the treatment period.

The study will evaluate whether an experimental medical device that emits a brief, 
intense magnetic field will relieve pain in the low back. The [LOCATION_002] Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a similar device for treatment of migraine, but 
this type of device has not been studied for the treatment of low back pain. No 
significant adverse reactions or side effects have been reported from the use of 
magnetic stimulation for headache treatment.  Some patients who have migraine 
headaches have exc ellent pain relief with the magnetic treatment even if they did not 
get pain relief with medications.  
 
We do not know whether magnetic treatment will relieve low back pain, so we will test 
this by [CONTACT_2931] a powerful electromagnet to the painful area of t he low back. In some 
subjects, the magnet will be turned on, but in other patients the magnet will not be 
turned on. Neither subjects nor subjects' treating doctor will know whether the magnet 
was turned on or not, although the study team will know which s ubjects received 
treatment with magnetic pulses. The effect on pain will be recorded periodically for 2 
days. If the subjects' reported pain is reduced as a result of the magnetic treatment 
compared with subjects who did not have the magnet turned on, then  the magnet might 
have reduced the pain. Additional studies will be needed to further investigate whether 
this therapy reduces low back pain.

RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND   
Approximately one third of the population suffers from acute and chronic pain at any 
given time, and the lifetime incidence of low back pain is 80%. Pain has been called a 
silent epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. Treatment of pain with medication incurs significant risks and side 
effects; even over -the-counter medication causes occasional fatalities (e.g., 
acetaminophen or Tylenol can cause liver toxicity; and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory 
drugs, such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_563931], can cause  bleeding). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_563932] a 
significant potential for abuse, addiction, and adverse reactions, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_563933].  
 
Electrical stimulation for the relief of pain has been used since antiquity, and with the 
development of com pact power sources and solid state electronics in the last century, it 
has become commonplace. Electrical stimulation has been applied to the peripheral 
(e.g., in the limbs) as well as the central (brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) nervous system, using 
implanted as well as external noninvasive devices.   
 
Electrical stimulation specifically for low back pain, the condition addressed in this 
protocol, is supported by [CONTACT_563937][INVESTIGATOR_54185] 
(SCS), using surgically implanted ele ctrodes and pulse generators. Randomized 
controlled trials have shown that SCS is superior to optimal medical management and 
to repeated low back surgery in patients with persistent or recurrent low back and leg 
 
 
 
TCMS Protocol Version: 1.0  
Page 13 of 17 pain following spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691]  (North et al., 2005). High frequency SCS has been effective 
for low back pain in particular. SCS has been in use for nearly 50 years. Medtronic, Inc.; 
St. Jude Medical, Inc.; and [LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation all have FDA -approved devices, 
which require surgical implant ation and maintenance for the production of electrical 
pulses to relieve pain.  
 
Subcutaneous peripheral nerve field stimulation targets low back pain via electrodes 
implanted directly over the painful area and is less invasive than SCS even though it 
uses the same implanted pulse generators as SCS (Barolat et al., 2009) .   
 
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a noninvasive technique, has been 
used for several decades to treat low back pain. TENS passes current through intact 
skin via surface  electrodes with conductive gels and adhesives. TENS is available 
without a prescription but is not free from side effects, notably skin pain caused by 
[CONTACT_563938] [Barker 
85], which limits the usage amplitude of the electrical current and thus makes it 
difficult to stimulate deep structures.  
 
Compared with electrical stimulation, magnetic stimulation has a much shorter history 
[Thomson 1910].  Magnetic stimulation is an application of Farad ay’s Law, whereby a 
high intensity magnetic pulse generates an electrical pulse within conductive media, 
including excitable tissue, viz., nerve and muscle. Magnetic stimulation has been used to 
stimulate peripheral nerves selectively  [Oberg 73, Polson 82] . Compared with other 
forms of stimulation, transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TCMS), which is 
administered through intact skin, can create larger electrical currents in nerves at 
greater depth with little, if any, skin pain [Barker 85]. In fact, magneti c stimulation can 
act through the skin and the skull to stimulate the brain, minimizing recruitment of 
overlying structures, such as pain fibers in the scalp. Such transcranial magnetic 
stimulation has been used extensively for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological 
disease (e.g., stroke) and treatment of psychiatric disease (e.g., depression).  Repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation [Wassermann 98] has been used to treat a number of 
pain conditions. A meta -analysis of repetitive transcranial mag netic stimulation, 
demonstrates effectiveness  for craniofacial pain syndromes [Leung 09].  "Single pulse" 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (at a much lower power than used in repetitive TMS) 
has been effective for migraine using a device that can deliver pulses, each of duration 
less than 1 msec, as often as every 30 seconds [Lipton 10, Diener 10].  
 
TCMS (of the periphery), unlike transcranial magnetic stimulation, has received little 
attention as a treatment for pain; it has been the subject of a single p ublished case 
series, with reportedly positive results in 5 patients with painful peripheral nerve 
injury or neuroma [Leung 14]. Modification of peripheral nerve activity —even if it is 
distal or collateral —in the same segment as a pain generator can  afford substantial 
relief (North et al., 1996). The development of an effective, minimal risk, non -invasive 
treatment of pain without medication would represent a significant advance in the field.  
 
 
 
 
TCMS Protocol Version: 1.[ADDRESS_740872] of a capacitor charge/discharge system with associated control 
and safety electronics. Using the charging circuitry, the capacitor stores energy to a pre -
set level. When the device receives a trigger input signal, t he stored energy, apart from 
that lost in the wiring and capacitor, is transferred to the stimulating coil and then 
returned to the instrument to reduce coil heating.  
 
The most widely used description of the output of magnetic stimulators is “magnetic 
field strength,” although this refers to the density of magnetic flux rather than total 
magnetic flux and is a poor measure of output produced by [CONTACT_563939]. In a small coil, where the magnetic flux is concentrated in a small area , the 
magnetic field intensity is higher than in a larger coil, but the field falls off much more 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_563934]. Hence a small coil is somewhat more powerful in the stimulation 
of superficial nerves, and a large coil is more suitable for structures  at depth. The 
amplitude, waveform, and spatial characteristics of the induced current all play a role in 
magnetic nerve stimulation.  
 
A more accurate indicator of the stimulating power output is the induced charge 
density per phase defined as the integral  of the induced current density during the rise 
time of the magnetic field. Unlike magnetic field strength, induced current density takes 
into account the effects of the amplitude and the duration of the induced stimulating 
current. Induced current density  does not, however, consider the effects of the nodal 
time constant of the myelinated nerve fiber. Unfortunately, the actual value of the 
induced charge density per phase is difficult to calculate accurately due to the 
complexities of the structure being s timulated. Different areas, such as bone, fat, grey 
matter, and white matter, with differing conductivities all affect the induced current and 
its path.  
 
The stimulating coil is the only part of a magnetic nerve stimulator that needs to come 
close to, or i nto contact [CONTACT_4490], the patient. During the discharge of the magnetic pulse, 
the coil winding is subjected to high voltages and currents. Although the pulse generally 
lasts for less than 1ms, the forces acting on the coil winding are substantial and depend 
on the coil size, peak energy, and construction. Careful coil design is, therefore, a very 
important aspect in the construction of a magnetic stimulator. Compared with a small 
coil, large coils contain more copper mass and generally have a lower electrical 
resistance; as a result, less heat is dissipated in the windings of large coils, and because 
of their higher heat capacity, they remain usable for much longer periods before 
becoming warm.  
 
Since the magnetic field strength falls off with distance from the stimulating coil, the 
stimulus strength is at its highest close to the coil surface. The stimulation 
characteristics of the magnetic pulse, such as depth of penetration, strength, and 
accuracy, depend on the rise time, the peak magnetic energy transferred to the coil, and 
the spatial distribution of the field. The rise time and the peak coil energy are governed 
by [CONTACT_563940] , 
 
 
 
TCMS Protocol Version: 1.0  
Page 15 of 17 whereas the spatial distribution of the induced electric field depends on the coil 
geometry and the anatomy of the region of induced current flow.

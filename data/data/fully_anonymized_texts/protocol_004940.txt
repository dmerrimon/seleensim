Dear [CONTACT_6827],  
 
Enclosed please find Amendment # 2 to protocol AOST1421 , A Phase 2 Study of Human -
Mouse Chimeric Anti -Disialoganglioside Monoclonal Antibody ch14.18 (Dinutuximab, 
NSC# 764038, IND# 4308) in Combination with Sargramos tim (GM -CSF) in Patients with 
Recurrent Osteosarcoma .  
 
This amendment updates the protocol by [CONTACT_895375] 2, 
20-hour infusions on Days 4 and 5 of a cycle to 4, 10 -hour infusions on Days 4 -7 of a cycle. 
With the change in infu sion schedule, the PK will now be mandatory for all patients. 
Unexpected death that is not related to disease and probably/likely related to treatment has 
been added to the list of unacceptable toxicities. The inclusion criteria have been updated 
to requir e a normal QTc interval per EKG and to only allow patients without a history of 
seizure disorder.  
 
The CAEPR and risks associated with ch14.[ADDRESS_1255000]. Jeffrey Moscow ([EMAIL_17091]).     
 
Several other adm inistrative changes have been made; specific changes are detailed below. 
Minor administrative updates (such as the correction of typographical errors or updates to 
the numbers of referenced sections) are tracked in the protocol but not specified below.  
 
Please let me know if we can offer further information.  
 
Sincerely,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES : PROTOCOL DOCUMENT  
In accordance with the above discussion, the following specific revisions have been made to the protocol. 
Additions are in boldfaced  font and deletions in strikethrough  font. 
 
# Section  Page(s)  Change  
1.  General  All Updated the protocol version date in the footer.  
2.  Title page  [ADDRESS_1255001] the change in Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) treatment 
from a 2 -day to a 4 -day infusion schedule and mandatory PK sampling 
for all patients enrolled after this amen dment.  
6.  1.2.1  11 Revised the aim “ To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma  in the proposed 
administration schedule .” 
7.  2.1 12-13 • Updated text to reflect the change in Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
treatment to a 4 -day infusion schedule.  
• Deleted text referring to dosing ch14.18 in an alternative (2 -day) 
infusion schedule.  
The two recent SAEs on AOST1421 of sudden death and grade [ADDRESS_1255002] 
4-day schedule as used in neuroblastoma patients as much more 
experience exists with treating patients on this schedule.    
8.  2.5.1  15 Updated section to include the serious adverse events observed with the 
alternative (2 -day) infusion schedule and modifications to the infusion 
schedule effective with the approval of this amendment.  
9.  2.5.2  16 Updated section to provide justification for now requiring PK sampling 
for all patients enrolled after the approval of this amendment.  
10.  3.1.2  19 Updated the instructions for submission of IRB/REB documents.  
11.  3.2.4  23 Updated the link to the performance status scales scoring.  
12.  [IP_ADDRESS]  24 Added inclusion criteria : “Baseline EKG shows normal QTc interval 
of ≤ 470 ms. ” -This has been added in light of the recent SAE of sudden 
death the cause for which remains unexplained but could have been a 
cardiac event secondary to dinutuximab therapy. Addition of this 
inclusion criteria would potentially ensure that at baseline, a pa tient is not 
at increased risk for arrhythmias.  
13.  [IP_ADDRESS]  24 Modified inclusion criteria to only allow patients with no known history 
of seizure disorder.   
-Patients with a known epi[INVESTIGATOR_895322] “Sudden 
Death in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_895323]” (SUDEP), the cause for which remains 
unknown. Given the concern for increased neurotoxicity with 
dinutuximab patients, this risk may be potentiated in pati ents with 
                                                                 AOST1421

• Added 24 -hour patient observation: “ Patients will be observed in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_895324] [ADDRESS_1255003] 
day of di nutuximab infusion in each cycle. ”  
- This was added as the risk of SAEs seems to be highest during and 
shortly after infusion completion. Additional observation in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_895325].  
15.  [IP_ADDRESS]  [ADDRESS_1255004] the change in Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) treatment 
to a 4 -day infusion schedule.  
17.  4.2.2.i  29 Updated TDM and Required Observations to include mandatory PK 
testing for patients enrolled after the approval of this amendment.  
18.  4.2.3  30-32 • Updated the administration instruction of sargramostim from days 4 
and 5 to days 4 -7. 
• Updated the administration of dinutuximab to the 10 -hour x 4 day 
schedule.  
• For pain management, changed the dose of morphine from milligrams 
to micrograms to be consistent with other sections of the protocol.  
• Added specific dosing details for alternative pain management 
regimen.  
19.  4.3.[ADDRESS_1255005] the change in Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) treatment 
to a 4 -day infusion schedule.  
20.  4.3.2.f  34 Updated TDM and Required Observations to include mandatory PK 
testing for patients enrolled after the approval of this amendment.  
21.  4.3.3  35 • Updated the administration instruction of sargramostim from days 4 
and 5 to days 4 -7. 
• Updated the administration of dinutuximab to the 10 -hour x 4 day 
schedule.  
22.  [IP_ADDRESS]  40 Added the following text clarifying the procedures for restarting 
dinutixumab for patients who required pressors for hypotension: “ If the 
50% rate is tolerated without further hypotension, rate can be 
increased to 100% as tolerated. If patient becomes hypotensive again 
at 100% rate, it should be decreased back to 50% after patient is 
clinically stable to receive the infusion again and remainder of the 
infusion should be completed at the decreased rate. ” 
                                                                 AOST1421

ABSTRACT  
Patients wi th recurrent osteosarcoma have a dismal prognosis with an overall survival of less than 30% at 
[ADDRESS_1255030] for these patients , with surgery remaining the mainstay of therapy  
at recurrence. A subset of patients with recurrent os teosarcoma is able to achieve a second or subsequent 
complete surgical remission and this subset holds a better prognosis than those who do not achieve a 
complete surgical remission. Nonetheless, the majority of patients who achieve a second or subsequent 
complete surgical remission will recur. GD2 is a cell surface disialoganglioside that is ubiquitously 
expressed on osteosarcoma tumor cells and therefore is a rational therapeutic target. Historical experience 
from neuroblastoma  (NB)  trials shows that anti -GD2 based therapy works best in the setting of minimal 
residual disease. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the effects of ch14.18  (dinutuximab ), an anti-GD2 
antibody , in combination with sargramostim ( GM-CSF) in patients with pulmonary recurrence of 
osteosarcoma that are able to achieve a complete surgical resection. The main objective of the study is to 
determine the disease control rate in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma treated with ch14.18 
(dinutuxima b) in combination with sargramostim . Secondary objectives include analysis of 
pharmacokinetics and toxicity of  ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) in this patient population.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Treatment of patients with recurrent osteosarcoma remains challenging with very few 
effective therapeutic options. A subset of patients with relapsed disease is able to achieve 
subsequent surgical remission, but the majority of patients will subsequently  relapse. 
Hence these patients continue to have a dismal prognosis.  
 
The main predictors of survival after osteosarcoma recurrence include the time to first 
recurrence, disease burden , and ability to achieve complete surgical remission after 
recurrence. Solitary pulmonary nodule and greater than [ADDRESS_1255031] recurrence are

favorable prognostic factors.1 Data from the  Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group 
(COSS) as well as for other studies show that for  patients with first osteosarcoma relapse 
that the median time to first relapse is 15-[ADDRESS_1255032] relapse 
seems longer than subsequent relapse s, a large duration of this interval includes 
administration of upfron t therapy for osteosarcoma ( an average  of 9 months). Therefore, 
the median time to first relapse from the end of upfront therapy is not significantly different 
compared to median time to second relapse.  
 
Five-year overall survival rates of 39% are reporte d for patients with first relapse who are 
able to achieve a second surgical remission , and  32% for patients who are able to achieve 
a third surgical remission (COSS data ).2,3 Data from the Rizzoli Institute show reported 5 -
year event -free actuarial survival of 38% after first metastasectomy and  32% after second 
metastasectomy , suggesting that patients who had the second metastasectomy had the same 
probability of survival as patients after the first metastasectomy .[ADDRESS_1255033] 15 years identified 96 eligible patients with 
relapsed osteosarcoma who had measurable disease at the time of enrollment. The 
estimated 4-month progression -free survival probability was 12% with a 95% confidence 
interval of 6% -19%. AOST0221, a Phase 2 study of inhaled sargramostim ( GM-CSF) in 
patients with first pulmonary recurrence of osteosarcoma who achieved a complete 
resection, is the  only study available to estimate EFS in a cohort  with complete surgical 
remission . Of the 43 eligible patients who received inhaled sargramostim , 41 were 
evaluated for disease outcome. The 12 -month EFS was 20% with a 95% confidence 
interval of 10 -34% (Mar k Krailo , personal communication ). Based on the above data for 
the fully resected cohort, disease control (DC) rate, defined as the probability of patients 
who do not have progressive disease or death due to progressive disease 12 months after 
start of pro tocol therapy , will be the primary outcome measure for this study.  
 
Limited progress has been made in identifying novel targets that may be therapeutic in 
osteosarcoma and there remains an urgent need for development of new agents that are 
effective in imp roving survival . GD2 , a cell surface disialoganglioside that is ubiquitously 
expressed in malignancies such as melanoma and neuroblastoma , has been successfully 
used in  NB to improve overall and event -free survival . GD2 has also been shown to be 
expressed in more than 95% of osteosarcoma samples , as discussed below,   thus making it 
a potential therapeutic target  for osteosarcoma .   
 
This study is a  Phase 2 trial to  evaluat e disease control rate as compared to historical 
experience in patients with  recurrent pulmonary osteosarcoma who achieve a complete 
surgical resection  following  treatment with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) plus cytokine therapy. 
Based on data from NB clinical trials, it is well established that anti -GD2 therapy is most 
beneficial in the setting of minimal residual disease and hence in this trial, only patients 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 13 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
with recurrent osteosarcoma who achieve a complete surgical remission are eligible. 
Enrolled p atients will receive ch14.18 (dinutuximab) as a 10-hour infusion per day for 4 
days in each cycle. This updated schedule has be en modified from the prior experimental 
schedule of 20 -hour infusion over 2 days. Therapy will be delivered every 28 days  for a 
total of 5 cycles or until disease progression or re currence. If ch14.18 (dinutuximab) plus 
cytokine therapy is found to be tolerable and effective  the COG Bone Tumor Committee 
will consider  incorporating  this agent  into the therapeutic regimen for  patients  with 
osteosarcoma in first remission .  
 
2.2 Precli nical Studies  
Strong immunoreactivity for the GD2 antigen  was detected in 15 of 17 
osteosarcoma s, including both primary and metastatic  tumors.5 More over, each of 
24 patient -derived osteosarcoma cell lines showed strong expression of GD2 and 
only 4.3% of osteosarcoma patient samples (n=44) were negative for GD2 by 
[CONTACT_895376] 14. 2G-2a antibody.[ADDRESS_1255034] osteosarcomas , may be a rational 
immunotherapeutic target for this disease.   
 
Preclinical data with murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) 3F8 and 14G2a 
demonstrated that the in vitro  and in vivo  activity against tumor cells was mediated 
by [CONTACT_895377] c ell mediated toxicity (CDC 
and ADCC respectively) by [CONTACT_895378], NK cells, 
neutrophils and monocytes.7,[ADDRESS_1255035] used anti -GD2 
antibody in conjunction with cytokines for potentially enhanced efficacy of the 
antibody.  However,  for the purpose o f AOST1421, IL -2 will not be used for the 
following reasons : a) more recent trials conducted by  [CONTACT_895379] -[ADDRESS_1255036] any additive benefit to GD2 antibody therapy and b)  IL-[ADDRESS_1255037] been completed using ch14.18 (dinutuximab) either alone or in 
combination with cytokines in adults with melanoma or sarcoma. In a Phase 1 trial of 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in patients with malignant melanoma, patients received ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) as a single dose of 5 -100 mg. The m ajor toxicity was infusion -related 
abdominal -pelvic pain syndrome requiring intravenous morphine. In a subsequent Phase 
Ia/Ib trial of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and sargramostim  in patients with malignant 
melanoma, patients received ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in do ses between 15 -60 mg/m2 
intravenously for 4 hours on Day 1. D ose limiting toxicities were observed at 60  mg/m2. 
Significant side effects included abdominal or extremity pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 14 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
myalgias, blood pressure changes and weakness. No ant itumor activity was seen.  In a Phase 
Ib trial of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) with interleukin -2 (IL2) in melanoma patients, the 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) maximum tolerated dose (MTD ) was 7.5  mg/m2/day x [ADDRESS_1255038] or extre mity pain, severe allergic reaction, 
weakness and pericardial effusion. Antitumor activity included one complete response, one 
partial response, stable disease in eight patients , and one patient with >50% decrease in 
hepatic metastases. More recently, a Phase 1 trial of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) along with R24 
monoclonal antibodies and IL2 was completed in patients with melanoma (23 patients) and 
sarcoma (4 patients). The MTD of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) was 5  mg/m2/day x 5 days, lower 
than the 7.5  mg/m2/day determ ined with IL2 alone. Two melanoma patients had partial 
response s, four patients had stable disease (one patient had gastrointestinal stromal 
sarcoma) and one patient remained without evidence of disease. Anecdotal evidence of 
anti-GD2 therapy exists in osteosarcoma from prior Phase 1 trials that included patients 
with os teosarcoma. In a Phase 1/1B trial of the murine antibody (14.2G2a ) plus IL2, 2 of 
33 patients had osteosarcoma. One patient had multiple bone metastases and received one 
cycle  of therapy. Two months later, repeat scans showed a complete response. This p atient 
remained disease free for 8  months but subsequently relapsed.12 In a Phase 1 trial of 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in patients with refractory NB and osteosarcoma, 1 of 11 treated 
patients had metastatic osteosarcoma to the bones and lungs. The patient had improvement 
in bone pain but progression of the  lung lesions after one cycle.  
    
2.4 Pediatric Studies  
 
Phase 1 trial of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in children  with refractory NB and 
osteosarcoma established the safety of antibody administration , although no MTD 
was reached. Pain was the most common side effect during treatment. Clinical 
responses (1 partial response and 4 mixed responses ) were observed in 5 of 10 NB 
patients.  Subsequently a Phase 1 trial of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in combination 
with sargramostim  and aldesleukin (interleukin -2, IL2) in patients with NB 
immediately following autologous bone marrow transplant  was performed . The 
MTD of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) was determined to be 25  mg/m2/d x 4 days every 
28 days  (NCI product) ; IL2 was given during Cycles  2 and 4 at a dose of 
3 MU/m2/d for 4 days one week before the antibody and at a dose of 4.5  MU/m2/d 
for 4 days concurrently with the antibody; sargramostim  was administered in 
Cycle s 1, 3 and 5 at 250  mcg/m2/d subcutaneously starting 3 days prior to ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) and continued for 3 days after the antibody therapy. Common 
toxicities including  neuropathic pain, fever, hypersensitivity reactions and 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_895331] e supportive care. No 
patient developed human anti -chimeric antibody ( HACA ). The study 
demonstrated feasibility of incorporating sargramostim  and IL2 with  dinutuximab . 
In another  Phase 2 trial of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) (50 mg/m2/day over 5 hours x 4 
days) plus sargramostim  (10 mcg/kg/d x 14 days ) pain, fever and tachycardia were  
the main adverse events. Of the 27 patients evaluable for response, there was one 
complete response , three partial responses , one mixed response and two stable 
disease . These early trials were followed by a Phase III randomized trial in patients 
with newly diagnosed NB who achieved complete or a partial response after 
induction chemotherapy.13 Interim analysis revealed a significant increases in 2-
year OS (86% versus 75%; P=0.02) and EFS (66% versus 46%; P=0.01) for 
patients randomized to the ch14.18 (dinutuximab) plus cytokine arm along with

Page 15 
Version date: 05/17/[ADDRESS_1255039] potential for benefit 
would similarly be in following complete surgical resection of metastases, i.e. in a 
setting of minimal res idual disease .  
 
2.5 Dosing Rationale  
In the COG NB trials, the MTD of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) was determined to be 
25 mg/m2/day (based upon NCI product  which was used in these trials ; equivalent 
to 17.5  mg/m2/day of the United Therapeutics product to be used in the AOST1421  
study) infused over 10 hours per day x 4 days every 28 days;  IL2 was given in 
Cycles  2 and 4 at a dose of 3  MU/m2/day for 4 days one  week before the antibody 
and at a dose of 4.5  MU/m2/day for 4 days concurrently with the antibody; 
sargramostim  was administered in Cycles  1, 3 and 5 at 250  mcg/m2/day 
subcutaneously starting 3 days prior to ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and continued for 7 
days after antibody therapy. Common toxicities were neuropathic pain, fever, 
hypersensitivity reactions and capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737] , likely related to ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) infusion alone and in combination with cytokines. Data from [CONTACT_895407]’ lab based o n simulations of different antibody administration 
schedules with the same total dose per cycle (daily for 10  hours x 4 days; 
continuous 48  hour infusion; continuous 96  hour infusion ; and continuous 120  
hour infusion) in 14 NB patients reveal no difference s in the overall  area under the 
curve ( AUC ) and drug exposure of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) (personal 
communication , [CONTACT_895408]) and hence we hypothesized that the schedule of 
administration should not affect the efficacy of dinutuximab . Therefore, p atients 
enrolled on this study were given dinutuximab as a 20 -hour infusion each day for 
a total of 2 days (35 mg/ m2/day for a total of 70 mg/m2/cycle). The infusion was 
allowed to be extended for an additional [ADDRESS_1255040] of this trial, there were two serious adverse events 
experienced by 2 separate patients  who were treated on protocol therapy. One 
patient experienced sudden unexplained death and the other experienced Grade 4 
neurotoxicity (depressed level of consciousness and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]).  While 
the exact cause of these events remains unclear, it  is possible that these events may 
have been  related to the experimental  infusion schedule of dinutuximab, possibly 
leading to higher peak concentrations of the drug. In light of these events, the 
infusion schedule of dinutuximab has been modified for the remainder of the study 
to a 10 -hour infusion each day for a total of 4 days. This revised schedule is 
identical to the schedule used in COG NB  trials.

The total dose of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) delivered per cycle will be 70  mg/m2 
(United Therapeutics compo und), which is equivalent to 100  mg/m2 of the NCI 
compound used historically in NB studies. We will evaluate the median time to 
infusion completion in our study patients.  
 
Recent data from SIOPEN presented at the 2014 Advances in Neuroblastom a 
Research me eting  showed that ch14.18 (dinutuximab) + IL2 is more toxic than 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) alone, and no more effective.15 IL2 will therefore not be 
used in this study due to lack of conclusive data that it adds to the efficacy of 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) therapy and significant concerns regarding toxicity of IL2 , 
such as capi[INVESTIGATOR_895332]. 
  
In Phase 1 trials of dinutuximab , the plasma clearance of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
followed a biphasic pattern. In patients with NB, the t½ was 3.4 ±3.1 hours and 
the t½β was 66.6 ±27.4 hours.16 In adult patients with melanoma and one patient 
with osteosarcoma, the t½ and t½β were significantly longer than in younger 
patients with NB.[ADDRESS_1255041]. Balis’ 
lab suggest that the AUC should remain similar with varying  schedule s of ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) infusion, it remains to be confirmed in actual p atient samples.  
Therefore, PK analysis at defined time points was mandatory  for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1255042] an increased probability of response.  Formalin -fixed , 
paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or cut sections of the tumor tissue (from 
the most recent surger y showing metastatic osteosarcoma ) will be required  from 
institutions for patients enrolled on this study.   
 
In general, the anti -tumor activities of unconjugated mAbs require the contribution 
of eithe r complement - or Fcγ -receptor (FcγR) -expressing effector cells to achieve 
tumor cell killing. How ever, because most tumor cells express increased amounts 
of complement -inhibiting proteins, which protect against complement -mediated 
lysis, antibody -dependent  cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) is considered the key 
antitumor mechanism of therapeutic antibodies in vivo . Natural killer (NK) cells, 
T-lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes are capable of mediating ADCC

Version date: 05/17/[ADDRESS_1255043] antibody -coated targets via their expression of FcγR for IgG. The FcγR 
genes display polymorphisms that greatly influence the affinity of IgG for the Fcγ 
receptor. NK cells beari ng the FcγRIIIa  158V/V allele mediate ADCC more 
effectively than those with F/F allele. Similarly, for FcγRIIA, the high -affinity H 
allele at position 131 results in greater affinity of FcγRIIa for IgG, whereas the 
low-affinity R allele is associated with decreased binding. The FCGR3A and 
FCGR2A gene polymorphism was reported to influence the response of lymphoma 
to rituximab (anti -CD20). As ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is very effective in mediating 
ADCC, its efficacy in osteosarcoma may be associated with FCGR3 and/or 
FCGR2 genotype.  
 
Killer -Immunoglobulin -like Receptors (KIR) recognize specific HLA molecules, 
regulate function of human natural killer (NK) cells and control self -tolerance. The 
interactions between KIR on donor NK cells and KIR ligands (KIR -L) on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_895333] -tumor efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell

relapsed/refractory NB receiving humanized  anti-GD2 antibody linked to IL2, 7 
of 24  mismatched patients experienced either complete response or improvement 
of their disease after immunocytokine therapy, while no response s or comparable 
improvement s of disease were observed in 14  patients who were KIR and KIR -L 
matched (p = 0.03).[ADDRESS_1255045] been shown to be of prognostic significance in gastrointestinal 
stromal tumo r sarcoma (GIST), which expresses NKp30 ligands and that is treated 
with NK -stimulatory KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Healthy individuals and those 
with GIST show different NKp30 isoform  expression patterns . In GIST  patients , 
predominant expression of th e immunosuppressive NKp30 c isoform (compared to 
the immunostimulatory NKp30a and NKp30b isoforms) was associated with 
reduced survival, decreased NKp30 -dependent tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α), 
IL10 and CD107a release, and defective secretions of interfer on-γ (IFN -γ) and 
interleukin  12 (IL12) involved in NK -DC cross -talk. Preferential NKp30c 
expression resulted partly from a single -nucleotide polymorphism  at position 3790 
in the 3' untranslated region of the gene encoding NKp30 . 21 In a recent French 
study, high levels of the immunosuppressive Nkp30 c-isoform were associated with 
worse prognosis (PFS , P= 0.01 ) in patients  with high risk NB.[ADDRESS_1255046] of

NKp30  isoforms and circulating B7-H6 levels may be more pronounced in patients 
receiving ch14.18 (dinutuximab) therapy.  
 
While a significant number of primary tumor samples have be en banked as part of 
the osteosarcoma biology study AOST06B1, a striking paucity exists in the 
number of banked relapsed or metastatic samples. The m ajority of osteosarcoma 
patients who succumb to disease die of progressi ve metastatic or recurrent disease.  
In several cancers, metastatic or recurrent tumors have been shown to have a 
distinct molecular phenotype compared to the primary tumor. Therefore, it is 
imperative to analyze the metastatic and relapse samples of osteosarcoma , in 
addition to the primary tumor , to be able to identify novel therapeutic targets in 
recurrent disease. This study will attempt to in crease the number of available 
metastatic and relapsed osteosarcoma samples to aid in future research studies in 
this specific cohort.  
 
Any available tumor specimen (either formalin -fixed or frozen) obtained from  
biopsy or resection of a suspected disease recurrence site will be requested for 
banking at the COG tumor bank for potential future research studies that may 
require analysis of m etastatic or relapsed samples.  Left over specimens from the 
GD2 tumor expression analysis will be banked for future research studies.  
 
While no significan t development of HACA has been observed in recent trials in 
neuroblastoma with using ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in comparable doses as this 
study, the immune profile of neuroblastoma patients is likely significantly different 
due to majority of patients having undergone an autologous stem cell transplant. 
The recurrent osteosarcoma patient population will likely be more 
immunocompetent and may have a higher potential of developi[INVESTIGATOR_895334]. Therefore, these will be assessed in 
peripheral blood of all patients receiving ch14.18 (dinutuximab) during the course 
of therapy.  
 
There are few biomarkers proven to predict outcome in osteosarcoma. Percent 
tumor necrosis has been a useful measure of treatment response in this disease 
although its value remains questionable across studies. In addition, histologic 
necrosis is not helpful to predict response at diagnosis or any sooner than definitive 
surgery usually around W eek [ADDRESS_1255047]

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed t herapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except 
where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan 
In this single arm trial,  eligible patients will receive 70 mg/m2/cycle  of ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) . Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) will be delivered as 17.5 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_1255064] day of dinutuximab i nfusion in each cycle.  
 
Sargramostim ( GM-CSF), 250 mcg/m2/day will be administered subcutaneously  once 
daily  for 14  days/cycle starting 3  days prior to the start of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion  
in each treatment cycle.  The maximum dose for sargramostim is 500  microgram s/dose.  It 
is strongly encouraged that Day  1 of all 5 cycle s be on a Friday and the start of ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) infusion be the subsequent Monday. If Monday is a holiday, the ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) infusion can start on Tuesd ay for that particular cycle.  
 
A baseline disease evaluation will be performed prior to study enrollment (Please see the 
table in Section 16.1.1  for details) . Imaging studies can be repeated for clinical care at any 
time per institutional preference  or as clinically indicated . 
  
Subsequent disease evaluations will be performed after Cycles  [ADDRESS_1255065], 
nuclear medicine imaging to evaluate for bone metastas es (bone scan or PET scan, per 
institutional standard for osteosarcoma) and an MRI of the original primary t umor site 
(substituting plain radiograph if metallic hardware impedes MRI scan).  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling during  the first and second cycles of treatment will be 
required for the first 10 patients enrolled on this study and for all patients enrolled after 
protocol amendment #2 . HACA samples are required of all patients.   
 
Pneumocystis Prophylaxis  
In the neuroblastoma protocols using dinutuximab, pneumocystis 
prophylaxis is routinely recommended. On this study,  the use of 
pneumocystis prophylaxis will be left to the discretion of the treating 
physician.

Other Anti-Cancer T herapy  
No other systemic anti -cancer therapy will be permitted. Radiotherapy 
is also not permitted during protocol therapy.  
 
Corticosteroid T herapy  
Pharmacologic doses of systemic corticosteroids should be used ONLY 
for life -threatening conditions (i .e., life-threatening allergic reactions 
and anaphylaxis such as bronchospasm, stridor) unresponsive to other 
measures. The use of dexamethasone as an anti -emetic is not permitted. 
Corticosteroid therapy can be used as a premedication for transfusion in 
patien ts known to have a history of transfusion reactions or for treatment 
of an unexpected transfusion reaction (hydrocortisone 2  mg/kg or less 
or an equivalent dose of an alternative corticosteroid). The use of 
steroids during protocol therapy requires clear j ustification and 
documentation.  
 
Other Supportive C are 
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, anti -emetics, fluids, electrolytes 
and general supportive care are to be used as necessary. Note: t he use of 
gabapentin as an adjunct for pain manageme nt should be considered.  
 
For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see:  
https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog -supportive -care-
guidelines  under Standard Sections for Protocols.  
 
a. No evidence of serious infection, or infection under control with no active 
disease and negative blood culture.  
b. Serum creatinine less than or equal to the upper limit of normal based on age 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
c. Platelet count > 50,000/µL  (untransfused) .  
d. Absolute phagocyte count of ≥ 1000/ µL. 
e. Total bilirubin  1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age  
 
Note:  Cycle-specific requirement s for ALT (Cycle 1 vs C ycles  2-5) and skin 
toxicity (Cycles  2-5) are outlined on the first page of each therapy delivery map.

Cycle 1   
 
Each 28-day cycle consists of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  and sargramostim (GM -
CSF) . 
 
NOTE : It is suggested that Day 1 of Cycle  1 be on a Friday .  
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and 
actual weight obtained within one week prior  to the beginning of each cycle.  
 
Sargramostim (GM -CSF) : Subcutaneous  
Dose: 250  micrograms/m²/dose  (maximum  500 mcg/dose) subcutaneously daily.  
Days: 1 through 14.  
 
NOTE : On Day s 4 to 7 of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion , sargramostim  should 
be administere d prior  to start of dinutuximab , around 8:00 - 9:00 AM. Follow 
sargramostim  with 0.9% sodium chloride ( NS) bolus (10  mL/kg) over 1  hour on 
each day of antibody infusion . 
 
Sargramostim  dose will be held if the total white cell count is >  50,000/ L. This 
is not a toxicity of sargramostim  but rather a possible outcome related to its use. 
Sargramostim  will be held until the total white cell count is < 20,000/ L and then 
will be resumed at 50 % dose for the r emainder of the  cycle. Full dose sargramostim  
will be used for subsequent cycles.  
 
If criteria for holding sargramostim  are met (e.g., see Sections 5.2.1. 8 and 5.2.2 ), 
then ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should be continued without sargramostim . 
 
Dinutuximab : IV infusion over 10 hours per day * for 4 days   
Dose: 70  mg/m2/cycle to be given as 17.5 mg/m2/dose once daily times four days 
on Days 4 -7 of the cycle.  
 
Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion may be extended up to [ADDRESS_1255069] 
be stopped after 20 hours from the start time.  
 
NOTE:  Begin antibody infusion one hour after sargramostim  injection on Day 4 (ie, 
immediately following the IV bolus of normal saline ). Each daily d ose should start 
at 0.88 mg/m2/hour x 0.5 hour  and then increased gradually to  1.75 mg/ m2/hour 
for the remainder of the infusion as tolerated. Further  rate escalation or reduction 
should be guided by [CONTACT_895381] 5.  
 
The rate and  the duration of infusion should be recorded carefully each day so the 
total daily dose can be calculated.  
 
• Recommended premedications include : 
o Hydroxyzine (0.5 -1 mg/kg; max dose 50  mg) PO or diphenhydramine (0.5 -
1 mg/kg; max imum  dose 50  mg) PO/IV over 10  minutes to start 
approximately 20  minutes prior to ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion; may be

Cycle 1  repeated every 6  hours as needed during ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion. 
Note : intravenous hydroxyzine is NOT recommended.  
o Acetaminophen (10 -15 mg/kg; max dose 650  mg) PO given approximately 
20 minut es prior to ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion; in patients not able to 
tolerate oral medications, aceta minophen 15  mg/kg (max dose 650  mg) IV 
over 15 minutes can be used; may be repea ted every 4 -6 hours as needed for 
fever.  
 
• Recommended pain management *: 
o Morphine sulfate loading dose immediately prior to ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
administration. A dose of 50 micrograms /kg is recommended, though this may 
be adjusted based on a given patient’s pain history.  
o Continue with morphine sulfate infusion titrated to effect. The recommended 
dose range for the continuous morphine infusion is 20-50 micrograms /kg/h our 
to continue for 2  hours after completion of the ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion.  
o Other opi[INVESTIGATOR_895337].  
o Gabapentin may be used in conjunction with other pain medications per 
institutional practice . 
o The use of additional pain medications (lidocaine, ketamine) in extenuating 
circumstances should be undertaken  in consultation with pediatric pain 
management specialists.  
• For example, a lidocaine infusion may be used in conjunction with IV 
bolus of morphine on prn basis. Suggested administration guidelines 
for a lidocaine infusion are shown below:  
• Give lidocai ne IV bolus at 2  mg/kg in 50  mL NS over 30  minutes 
prior to the start of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion.  
• At the beginning of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion, start IV 
lidocaine infusion at 1  mg/kg/h our and continue until two hours 
after the completion of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion.  
• May give morphine IV bolus 20-50 micrograms /kg every 2  hours 
prn pain.  
• Patient should be monitored closely for sedation scale, EKG (rate 
and rhythm), HR, BP, RR, oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter) and 
pain score. If patient develops dizziness, perioral numbness, 
tinnitus attributable to lidocaine, then stop lidocaine infusion.  
o Another alternative pain regimen that may be used in subsequent cycles if the 
above regimen is not well tolerated or inadequate to control pa in is a 
combination of hydromorphone and dexmedetomidine as described by [CONTACT_895382].29 and outlined in Section 4.3 .3. This should be undertaken in consultation 
with pediatric pain management specialists and institutional guidelines 
followed for monitoring.  
1. Start both hydromorphone and dexmedetomidine infusions 1  hour 
prior to commencement of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion.  
2. Start hydromorphone at 2  micrograms/kg/h our and titrate up to a 
maximum of 8  micrograms/kg/h our 
3. Start dexmedetomidine at 0.1  micrograms/kg/h our and titrate up 
to a maximum of 0.6 micrograms/kg/h our to achieve adequate 
analgesia

o Patients should be w eighed daily on the days of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
administration.  
 
• Have immediately available at the bedside during the ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
infusion : 
o Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:10,000) 0.01  mg/kg or 0.1  mL/kg: IVP (max 5  mL) every 
3-5 minutes.  
o Hydrocortisone 2  mg/kg (max 100  mg) IVP. Only use it for life -
threatening reactions (hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema involving 
the airway) not responsive to other measures.  
 
See Section 5.0  for Dose Modific ations based on Toxicities. Information on management of toxicities 
including anaphylaxis and hypertension is also included in Section 5.0 . It is recommended that these be 
reviewed, printed and available on the in patient unit to facilitate treatment decisions.  
 
Following completion of a cycle, the next c ycle starts on Day 2 9 or when starting criteria are met, (whichever 
occurs later) . If the starting criteria are not met within  4 weeks, then the patient will go off protocol therapy .

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES  
In addition to dose modifications, this section provides information regarding management 
of toxicities known to be associated with protocol ther apy. 
 
5.1 Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity  
If there is a delay of ≥ 28 days in recovery of APC to ≥ 1000/ µL and/ or platelets to 
≥ 50,000/ µL to start the next treatment cycle, the patient will be removed from  protocol 
therapy.  
 
Patients who develop atypi[INVESTIGATOR_151258] (which is one of the extremely 
rare side effects of ch14.18) should discontinue all further protocol therapy.  
 
5.2 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematologic Toxicity  
An elevation in ALT that causes a delay of ≥ 14 days between treatment cycles will require 
a 25% reduction in the dose of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) for subsequent cycles (i .e., ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) dose: 52.5  mg/m2/cycle). If a delay of ≥ 14 days between treatment cycles 
recurs due to elevation in ALT despi[INVESTIGATOR_140009], the patient will be removed from 
protocol therapy.  
 
Treatment of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) induced hypotension (without 
evidence of allergic reaction)  
• If hypotension  is severe and accompanied by [CONTACT_732161], end 
organ dysfunction, or acidemia – Pediatric Advanced Life Support 
(PALS) or Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) 
guidelines should be followed and ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion 
should be discontinued  for this cycle . 
 
• In the absence of poor perfusion, end organ dysfunction or 
acidemia, moderate hypotension is defined as:  
o Symptomatic decreases in blood pressure and/or  
o Systolic blood pressure (SBP) <  80 mmHg for age >  12 years  
o SBP <  70 mmHg for a ge 1-12 years  
o SBP <  65 mmHg for age <  1 year OR  
o SBP or DBP decreased by >  20 % below baseline  
 
• If moderate hypotension is observed:  
o Immediately hold dinutuximab  
o Give normal saline bolus (20  mL/kg as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2595])  
o Stop or adjust doses of narcotics and sedating H1 blockers  
o Consider use of Trendelenberg position  
 
• If hypotension persists after the above measures have been taken:  
o Reassess perfusion and end organ function; follow PALS or 
ACLS  algorithm if needed  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 39 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
o Repeat NS bolus  
o Consider use of albumin if albumin <  3 gm/dL  
o Consider use of PRBCs if Hb <  10 gm/dL  
o Consider transfer to intensive care setting  
 
• If hypotension persists following 2 volume boluses, give an 
additional bolus and prepare to administer pressors  
o Adrenergic pressors, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_98339], are 
preferred over dopamine . 
 
• Resumption of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  
o For patients whose hypotension resolves promptly and 
completely with limited volume resuscitation ( ≤ 40 mL/kg) and 
without requirement for pressor support, ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) may be restarted at 50% of the previous infusion 
rate. The ch14.18 (dinutuximab) may be restarted once the 
blood pressure has normalized and remains stable for a 
minimum of 2 hours aft er volume resuscitation is completed. If 
blood pressures are stable for 2  hours after the restart of 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) at 50% rate, the infusion may be given 
at full rate for that day and subsequent days. If the patient again 
experiences hypotension re quiring multiple volume boluses 
(≥ 40 mL/kg) when ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is given at full rate 
but tolerates the 50% infusion rate, the remaining days’ 
infusion of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should be given at the 
tolerated 50% rate of infusion  once blood pressu res are stable 
again . The infusion may be started  at the full rate at the start of 
subsequent cycles . 
o For patients who require multiple volume boluses (>  40 mL/kg) 
for hemodynamic stabilization, ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should 
be resumed the following day a t 50% of the initial infusion rate.  
▪ If blood pressures are stable for 2 hours after 
resumption of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) at the reduced 
rate, the remainder of the antibody infusion may be 
given at the full rate. If hypotension recurs at full rate, 
but pa tient tolerates the 50% rate, then continue 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion at 50% rate for the 
remaining duration of infusion once blood pressures 
are stable again.  
▪ If hypotension recurs at the reduced rate, the measures 
above should again be taken and o nce blood pressure 
is stable for [ADDRESS_1255078] volume resuscitation, ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) can be resumed at a further 50% 
decrease in rate. If the patient’s blood pressures are 
stable at the second 50% reduction in rate the 
remaining days’ infusion of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
should be given at that rate until 4 days  from the start 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 40 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
of ch14.18 are completed.  
▪ If hypotension recurs at the second rate reduction, 
discontinue ch14.18 (dinutuximab) for that day. The 
antibody infusion may be restarted the following day 
after ensuring the patient is volume replete at the rate 
that was reached with second 50% reduction. If blood 
pressure remains stable, continue daily 20 -hour 
infusion s at this rate  until 4 days  from the start of the 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion are completed . The 
infusion may be started  at the full rate at the start of 
subsequent c ycles . 
 
o For patients who require pressors for treatment of hypotension, 
if blood pressure is stable off pressors for at least 6 hours, 
administration of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) may be resumed at 
50% of the initial infusion rate on the day following the 
hypotensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_895340] 4 day window 
from the start of ch14.18  (dinutuximab) . If the 50% rate is 
tolerated without further hypotension, rate can be increased to 
100% as tolerated. If patient becomes hypotensive again at 
100% rate, it should be decreased back to 50% after patient is 
clinically stable to receive the infusion again and  remainder of 
the infusion should be completed at the decreased rate. Care 
should be taken to ensure that the patient is volume replete. 
Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should not be given to patients who 
continue to require pressor support. Patients who require 
pressor support for ≥ 24 hours due to treatment -related 
hypotension despi[INVESTIGATOR_895341]. Patients who again require 
pressor support when ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is resumed should 
discontinue protocol ther apy.  
 
 
Treatment of Allergic Reactions/I nfusion Reactions   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Mild allergic reactions/infusion reactions to ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) infusion  
• A mild allergic reaction is limited to rash, flushing, 
urticaria, mild dyspnea – Grade 1 or 2  
• The following recommendations do NOT apply to Grade 
3 or 4 allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis  
• Management  
o Decrease rate of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) to 50% of

o When symptoms resolve, resume original infusion 
rate 
o If symptoms recur when original rate is resumed, 
decrease to 50% rate again  
o Infusion must be stopped after 4th day infusion  is 
comp leted  (whether the full dose of ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) has been administered or not); 
document total amount of drug given in the 4 day  
period  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Moderate to severe allergic reactions/infusion reactions to 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion  
• Moderate to severe reactions include any of the 
following: symptomatic bronchospasm, allergy -related 
edema/angioedema, hypotension, or anaphylaxis – 
Grade 3 or 4  
• The following recommendations do NOT apply to Grade 
1 or 2 allergic reactions  
• Management  
o Immediately hold ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  
o Assess airway, breathing and circulation  
o Follow institutional guidelines for rapid response 
team notification if clini cally indicated  
o For airway concerns  
▪ Administer oxygen and albuterol immediately 
for bronchospasm  
▪ Administer IV diphenhydramine  
▪ Administer epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000 IM 
recommended) immediately if upper airway 
involved or if airway issues are accompanied by 
[CONTACT_732162]  
▪ Administer IV hydrocortisone (1 -2 mg/kg) if 
the patient has frank anaphylaxis with 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_732087] ≥ 2 doses of

without the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_895344], ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
may be resumed at 50% of the previous rate of 
infusion on the same day as the reaction occurred. If 
symptomatic angioedema or asymptomatic 
bronchospasm recurs when the ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) is restarted, discontinue 
immunotherapy for that day and if symptoms/signs 
resolve completely that day, resume the next day 
with additional pre -medication of hydrocortisone 1-
2 mg/kg IV. For this re -challenge, the infusion 
should be given in an ICU  setting.  
o For patients whose bronch ospasm or angioedema 
requires the use of systemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], protocol 
therapy should be discontinued.  
o For patients with bronchospasm or angioedema that 
does not require systemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_895345], guidance in Section 5.2.1 .1 should be 
followed.  
 
Management of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_895346] S yndrome ( ≥ Grade 3)  
• Hold ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion  
• Provide oxygen, fluids as needed  
• Diuretics should be used with caution and hypotension avoided  
• See Section 5.2.1 .1 for management of hypotension  
• Do NOT resume ch14.18 (dinutuximab) therapy if  symptoms of 
severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_895347] a given cycle. Only resume ch14.18 (dinutuximab) therapy 
when the capi[INVESTIGATOR_895348] (Grade 2 or less).  
• If ca pi[INVESTIGATOR_732093], may resume ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
infusion at 50% rate the same day and for subsequent days during a 
given cycle. The infusion may be given at the full rate at the start of 
subsequent cycles  
• If mechanical ventilation (any duration) or pressor support for 
≥ 24 hours is required due to therapy -related capi[INVESTIGATOR_59374], the patient should discontinue protocol therapy.  
 
Management of R enal Insufficiency (unrelated to hypotension)  
• Consider the possibility of ren al hypoperfusion in the context of 
borderline hypotension; administer volume if appropriate  
• If the patient’s creatinine is elevated to ≥  2 x the upper limit of 
normal for age/gender (see table in Section 3.2. 7.2) and elevation 
persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_785939], hold dinutuximab  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 43 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
• Modify dosing of concomitant medications that may contribute to or 
be affected by [CONTACT_732163]  
• When urine output returns to norma l and creatinine returns to <  2 x 
uppe r limit of normal for age/gender, resume ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
at 50% rate. If renal function normalizes by [CONTACT_53016], 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) may be administered at full rate. If renal 
function is not sufficiently improved (urine output normal and 
creatinine <  [ADDRESS_1255080] for age/gender) by [CONTACT_2006]  7 of the cycle , no 
further ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should be given during that cycle of 
therapy. If renal function has normalized by [CONTACT_895385], retreatment with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is 
permitted  starting at full rate  
 
Management of H yponatremia (≥  Grade  3; Na <  130 mEq/L)  
• Change hypotonic fluids to isotonic fluids as compatibilities permit  
• Avoid administration of oral free water  
• Correct fluid losses due to diarrhea  
• 3% sodium chloride  may be used to correct hyponatremia as per 
institutional discretion  
• If Grade  ≥ 3 hyponatremia persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_732097], discontinue ch14.18 (dinutuximab) for the remainder 
of the cycle. Sodium should be monitored closely during the next 
cycle of therapy. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_895349] c ycle of therapy, though ch14.18 (dinutuximab) would 
again be discontinued if Grade [ADDRESS_1255081]

Management of F ever in the Absence of  Hypotension  
• Administer antipyretics  
• Adjust fluids to account for insensible losses if fever is persistent  
• Obtain blood culture  
• Administer empi[INVESTIGATOR_895350] -Related P ain*  
• No further ch14.18 (dinutuximab) therapy should be given to 
patients who experience treatment related pain that cannot be 
controlled despi[INVESTIGATOR_895351] a given cycle. 
Treatment with gabapentin or similar agent should be initiated if not 
already being administered. If pain that is not controlled with opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]  
(along with either lidocaine or dexmedetomidine) recurs during a 
subsequent cycle, the patie nt should discontinue protocol therapy  
• For patients with treatment -related pain requiring intravenous 
narcotics for ≥  48 hours following completion of ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) therapy, gabapentin or similar agent should be 
initiated if not already being ad ministered. If pain requiring

Version date: 05/17/2017  
prolonged intravenous narcotics (≥  96 hours following completion 
of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) therapy) recurs during a subsequent cycle 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_65698], the patient should discontinue protocol 
therapy.  
*Note: For patien ts who have previously undergone amputation of an 
extremity for local tumor control and experience phantom pain, there is 
a possibility of worsening of phantom pain with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) 
therapy. This should be managed similar to guidelines for pain 
management listed in Section s 4.2.3  and 4.3.3 . In addition, tricyclic anti -
depressants such as amitriptyline can be considered for these pa tients as 
it has shown to be of  benefit  in patients with phantom pain. Protocol 
therapy should be discontinued if phantom pain is uncontrolled despi[INVESTIGATOR_895352].  
 
Management of Visual C hanges  
• Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should be discontinued for the cycle for 
patients who develop dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_895353]. 
Sargramostim should be completed for that cycle.  If pupi[INVESTIGATOR_895354], the patient should receive ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) at a dose that is 50% reduced compared to the prior 
dose. Full dose sargramostim  should be given. If the lower dose of 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is tolerated without worsening of ocular 
toxicity, full dose ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should be given in 
subsequent cycle s. If visual toxicity worsens  on the 50% reduced 
dose, the patient should discontinue all immunotherapy . 
• Dose reductions for changes in accommodation are not required  
 
Management of Serum S ickness  
• Identification of serum sickness – signs and symptoms include 
arthralgias/arthritis, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, 
glomerulonephritis in the presence of persistent fevers, cutaneous 
eruptions  
• Serum sickness typi[INVESTIGATOR_895355] [ADDRESS_1255082] previously been sensitized to the causative agent  
• Patients with ≥  Grade 3 serum sickness should discontinue protocol 
therapy.  
• For Grade 2 serum sickness, antihistamines should be prescribed  
 
Management of Neurotoxicity  
• Patients who develop Grade 4 neurotoxicity should discontinue 
protocol therapy.  
• Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) should be discontinued for the remainder of 
the current cycle of therapy for patients who develop Grade 3 
sensory neuropathy or Grade 3 motor neuropathy. If abnormalities

Page 45 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
resolve by [CONTACT_895386] 50% 
total dose of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) per cycle  (ie, ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) dose: 35 mg/m2). If symptoms do not completely 
resolve or recur with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) then the patient should 
discontinue protocol therapy . 
 
• Hold sargramostim  if total white blood cell count is >  50,000/µL; resume at 
50% dose when the count is <  20,000/µL. Administer full dose with 
subsequent cycles and modify again if the count exceeds 50,000/µL . Ch14.18 
should be continued as per protocol in the event sargram ostim is held.  
• Localized skin reactions to sargramostim  are common, and sargramostim  can 
be continued when reactions are mild. Rotation of sites of injections is 
recommended rather than use of subcutaneous catheters, such as I nsuflon for 
subcutaneous inj ection when skin reactions occur. Consider use of 
antihistamines. If ≥  Grade 3 injection site reactions occur, stop sargramostim  
for the current cycle and discontinue sargramostim  for subsequent cycles of 
therapy.  
• A syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1506], hypoxia, flushing, 
hypotension, syncope, and/or tachycardia has been reported following the 
administration of the first dose of sargramostim  in a particular cycle. This 
syndrome generally resolves with symp tomatic treatment and usually does not 
recur with subsequent doses of sargramostim  in the same cycle of treatment. 
For safety purposes in this study, if such a “first dose reaction” occurs, the 
sargramostim  dose will be reduced to 50% for the next dose (ie , sargramostim  
dose 125  mcg/m2). If a similar reaction occurs at the 50% dose, the 
sargramostim  will be discontinued for that patient. If the first dose at 50% does 
not cause any recurrent severe symptoms, subsequent doses can be escalated 
back to 100%. If  recurrent severe symptoms are observed at 100% dose, then 
the dose will be reduced to 50%. If 50% is tolerated, that dose should be 
administered for all subsequent protocol treatment for that patient. If recurrent 
severe symptoms are seen at the 50% dose,  the sargramostim  will be 
discontinued for subsequent cycles of therapy.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
6.1 Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody  14.18  (Dinutuximab)    (05/12/2017 ) 
(Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody 14.18; human/murine anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody; 
chimeric anti -GD2; chimeric mAb 14.18; ch14.18 , dinutuximab, Unituxin® ) NSC#  764038 , 
IND#  4308  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Chimeric MOAB 14.18 (ch14.18 , UTC) is an anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody composed of the 
variable region heavy and light chain genes of the murine mAb 14.G2a and the human 
constant region genes for heavy chain IgG [ADDRESS_1255083] profound with neu trophils, especially in the presence of 
recombinant human granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor.  
 
The PK profile of ch14.18 has been determined in adults with melanoma and children with 
neuroblastoma. Although the plasma clearance for both group s of patients follow a two -
compartment model, circulating antibody is cleared from the plasma at a much faster rate 
in children than adults (mean t ½β = 66.6 ± 27.4 ho urs in children versus 123 ± 29  hours and 
181 ± 73 hours in two adult trials, respectively ). Maturation of the hepatic and renal 
systems with age is thought to impact on drug metabolism and elimination and could 
account for these differences. In general, the mAb half -life following the first course of 
treatment was longer than the half -lives fo llowing subsequent courses in a given patient.  
 
Toxicity:  
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
MoAb 14.18, chimeric  (CH14.18, NSCs 623408 and 764038)  
 
 The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
[CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset 
of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI 
(except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/ electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for further 
clarification. Frequency is provided based on 351 patients. Below is the CAEPR for MoAb 14.18, chimeric 
(CH14.18).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the 
AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational 
agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited 
reporting is required.

4Infection includes all 75 sites of infection under the INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS SOC.  
 
5Myelitis expressed as transverse myelitis has occurred in patients treated with chimeric MoAb 14.18. Symptoms may 
include weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, or incontinence.  
 
6Acute urinary retention occurs during therapy and is thought to be due to fluid shifts and narcotic administration that 
accompany ch14.18 administration.  Atonic urinary bladder results in chronic urinary retention (CUR) that requires 
intermittent urethral catheterization days to weeks following chimeric MoAb 14.18 administration.  
 
Adverse events reported on MoAb 14.18, chimeric (CH14.18) trials, but for which there is insufficient

Note : MoAb 14.18, chimeric (CH14.18) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events 
never previously associated with either agent.  
 
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Please note that the following information  pertain s only to the ch14.[ADDRESS_1255084] 
manufactured by  [CONTACT_895387]. T he UTC manufactured drug is the only 
supply permitted on this clinical trial.  
 
Ch14.18 is provided as a sterile solution in single -dose vials containing 17.5 mg/5 mL (3.5 
mg/mL) in 20  mM Histidine, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween [ADDRESS_1255085] vials should 
be stored in the r efrigerator (2ºC to 8ºC). Stability studies of the intact vials are ongoing.

Version date: 05/17/2017  
Withdraw the required dose of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  from the vial(s) and inject the exact 
volume for the dose (17.5  mg/m2/dose) into a bag containing 100 mL of 0.9% sodium 
chlori de. The use of a filter during preparation is not required. The final prepared product 
of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  in NS is stable at room temperature for 24 hours when diluted to 
a concentration between 0.044 mg/mL and 0.56  mg/mL; however, the final dosage f orm 
should be prepared immediately prior to administration as there is a maximum infusion 
time of 20 hours. The minimum infusion time for the antibody infusion is 10 hours.  There 
is no need to keep empty  or partially used vials of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) . 
 
Lot number information will be collected on the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form 
(DARF) (see the Agent Accountability  section below).  
  
Guidelines for Administration:   
See Treatment , Dose Modifications  and/or Supportive Care sections of the protocol.  
 
Patient Care Implications:  
Pain is one of the most common adverse effects of ch14.18. It is predominately neuropathic 
and manifests as abdominal cramps or back and extremity pain. Prophylactic administration 
of morphine by [CONTACT_895388]14.18. 
Other narcotics  such as hydromorphone or fentanyl can be used. Gabapentin may be used in 
conjunction with other pain medications per institutional practice. Use of additional pain 
medications (lidocaine, ketamine , dexmedetomidine ) in extenuating circumstances should be 
undertaken in consultation with pediatric pain management specialists.  
 
Acute allergic or infusion reactions are common and may include hypotension, urticaria, 
hypoxia, and dyspnea. Premedication with antihistamines and acetaminophen are required for 
ch14.1 8 administration.  
 
Human anti -chimeric antibodies (HAC A) may block the effectiveness of therapy by 
[CONTACT_895389]. HA CA 
responses may also be associated with immune -complex related adverse eve nts such as serum 
sickness and anaphylaxis. Although no increase in allergic reactions has been observed in 
patients treated with ch14.[ADDRESS_1255086] 
induced serum sickness in some patients.  
 
Supplier:  Manufac tured by [CONTACT_895390], DCTD, NCI.  Do

(Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor, rhu GM -CSF, rGM -CSF, GM-CSF, 
Leukine® ) NSC  #613795          
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Sargramostim (recombinant human GM -CSF) is a glycoprotein produced in yeast ( S. 
cerevisiae ) by [CONTACT_12060]. r GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor 
which supports survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor 
cells. rGM -CSF induces partially committed progenitor cells to divide and differe ntiate in 
the granulocyte -macrophage pathways. rGM -CSF stimulates the production of monocytes, 
granulocytes, erythrocytes, and sometimes, megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It also 
induces mature neutrophil and monocytes to increase phagocytosis, superoxid e generation, 
ADCC, tumoricidal killing and cytokine production (IL -1 and tumor necrosis factor). 
Recombinant human GM -CSF is a glycoprotein of [ADDRESS_1255089] injection. The elimination t ½ ranges from 1.5 -2.7 hours after SubQ 
or IV administration.

We are not interested in promoting the agent for further investigation if the probability of 
remaining analytic event free at 12 months after enrollment in any particular individual is 
less than or equal to 30%. We will be interested in promoting the agent  for further

Version date: 05/17/[ADDRESS_1255098] 50%. The statistical analysis of AOST0221 demonstrated that the current point 
estimate of the 12 month EFS is 0.2 with an upper 95% conf idence bound of approximately 
30%, so the target [ADDRESS_1255099]  determined the therapy does not offer sufficient disease control 
to warrant further study.  If all 39 patients are enrolled and the true 12 month disease control 
probability is 30%, the  therapy will not be considered for further development with 
probability 0.91. If all 39  patients are enrolled and the true 12 month disease control 
probability is 50%, the therapy will be considered for further development with probability 
0.90. Enrollmen t will be terminated in this cohort with the conclusion that ch14.18 
(dinutuximab) will not be considered for further development if, at any time, more than 
24 patients demonstrate disease progression or die prior to 12 months after study 
enrollment.  
 
9.3 Methods of Analysis  
Aim 1.1.1: The analysis for the decision rule is described in Section 9.2 . Only evaluable 
patients will be considered in the analysis; patients who are not evaluable may be replaced for 
execution  of the study decision rule. Only patients who can be confirmed to be free of 
detectable disease [ADDRESS_1255100] experienced 
an event; all other patients will be considered censored at last patie nt contact. The probability 
of remaining event -free as a function of time since enrollment will be estimated by [CONTACT_895392].[ADDRESS_1255101] confidence 
intervals of that probability.32 
 
Aim 1.2.1 : For the secondary objective of characterizing pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab , 
the parameters that will be estimated for each patient who participates in this aspect of the 
trial will be . The average and standard deviation of these 
estimates will be repo rted. In order to obtain the most data possible to identify any changes 
in PK parameters such as Cmax and serum half -life, we will require all patients who enroll 
subsequent to the approval of amendment #[ADDRESS_1255102] -amendment patients to be enrolled, power calculations to 
justify the sample size choice were not executed.

Aim 1.2.2 : We will monitor each cycle for unacceptable toxicity (UT). We will base the 
definition of UT on Sectio n 9.3.3 of study ANBL0931. Any of the following will be 
considered an “Unacceptable Toxicity” : 
• Grade ≥ 4 allergic reaction  
• Grade ≥ 4 capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]  
• Grade ≥ 3  peripheral motor neuropathy , duration ≥  2 weeks  
• Grade ≥  4 pain, requiring narco tics/lidocaine AND  persist ing ≥ 4 days after the end of 
ch14.18 (dinutuximab) infusion  
• Anaphylaxis  
• Unexpected death where unexpected is defined as d eath on protocol therapy or within 
[ADDRESS_1255103] 85% of planned protocol therapy, or in which a UT is observed will 
be considered a repo rting period in which a toxicity event has occurred. All other evaluable 
RPs will be considered free of a toxicity event.   
 
We will use a Bayesian rule to monitor for excessive toxicity. We will assume a beta prior 
distribution with α=0. 4 and =1.6. If th is posterior probability of the chance of UT is at 
least 30% exceeds 80%, we will identify the regimen to the COG DSMC, Bone Tumor 
leadership and CTEP as associated with a toxicity profile that may require modification of 
the regimen. Descriptive analyses of this safety information will be performed and will 
include the incidence of adverse events, severe adverse events, serious adverse events, and 
fatal adverse events. Type, frequency, and severity of laboratory abnormalities will also be 
analyzed.  
 
Exampl es of situations in which this rule will indicate unacceptable toxicity have been 
noted and are presented below:

9.6 Statistical Considerations for Exploratory Aims  
 
Aim 1.3. 2: We expect at least 70% of patients will submit a peripheral blood 
specimen prior to the start of chemotherapy for the assessment of KIR, NKp30 and 
FcγR genotype. Only eligible patients with evaluable KIR and/ or FcγR results will 
be considered in this analysis. The FcγR genotype result characterized as H/R, R/R 
or H/H will be considered as the predictor variable of interest. KIR/KIR ligand 
mismatch w ill be categorized as present or absent. Presence of the 
immunosuppressive isoform NKp30c will be categorized as present or absent. The 
outcome measure will be DC success (Y es v. No). Logistic regression using the 
categorical FcγR result will be fitted to the data. The fitted coefficients from the 
logistic regression, and the p -value for the test of the hypothesis of no relationship 
between FcγR result and probability of DC success will be used to characterize 
this exploratory analysis. Logistic regression using the categorical KIR/KIR ligand 
mismatch (present v. absent) will be fitted to the data. The fitted coefficients from 
the logistic regression, and the p -value for the test of the hypothesis of no

10%, we expect at least 63% of patients will provide samples for this goal.  
 
Aim 1.3.3 : No specific statistical plan currently exists for the banking aim of the 
study. Individual statistical plans will be developed for future studies answering a 
specific question using these banked tumor specimens.  
 
HACA will be determine d using a sample of blood taken before the start of each 
cycle  and within 30 days after the end of Cycle 5.  All patients will contribute data 
from each cycle  for the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of human anti -
chimeric antibody (HACA). At each ti me point, the optical density of the ELIZA 
bridging assay will be calculated. Patients will be identified as HACA positive if 
there is any optical density above background levels and the quantitative level of 
HACA activity will be taken as the optical dens ity (OD) at a wavelength of [ADDRESS_1255111] of such studies will 
be required and reviewed by [CONTACT_895393].

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for 
toxicity and performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website  
(http:/ /ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm). Additionally, 
toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms.  
 
Please note: ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referen ced on the CTEP website (ie, v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to version 
5.0). 
 
10.2 Disease Evaluation  
For the purposes of this study, patients will be evaluated for disease progression following 
Cycle 2, Cycle 5 and then at month s 8 and 12 from the start of therapy.  
  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 64 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
Disease progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) .33 
 
The app earance of one or more new lesions is considered progression.  Please see 
Section 16.1.1  for further details.  
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedite d manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
11.2 Determination of R eporting Requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) wh ether the patient 
has received an investigational or commercial agent ; 2) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and 
the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse e vent; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431423].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Application ( IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead f rom 
a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some 
occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules 
apply.  
• Concurrent administratio n: When an investigational agent is used in 
combination with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be 
investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the 
guidelines for investigational agents.  
• Sequential administrati on: When a study includes an investigational agent 
and a commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is 
given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, 
expedited reporting of adverse events that occur prior to s tarting the 
investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial  agents. 
Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited 
reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent reporting 
guidelines.

Page 65 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
11.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements  – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance , as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI 
requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting table s 
assigned to the protocol , using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS).  
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting i n inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718].  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability t o 
conduct normal life functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medi cal judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1255112] 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must b e reported 
according to the CTEP -AERS  reporting table s in this protocol.  
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal lif e functions (formerly referred to as disabilities) , 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if it 
occurs at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI IND/IDE  since 
these are considered to be serious AEs.  
 
Reportable Categories of Death  
 
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 
28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed t o a CTCAE term associated with G rade 5.  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 66 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl c ysts and polyps) - Other 
(Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the same 
name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease 
(e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical 
deterioratio n associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1255113] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within [ADDRESS_1255114] dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention.  
 
A secon dary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e .g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
 
The NCI requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with 
an agent under  an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol.  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior maligna ncy (and 
is NOT a metastasis  from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.”  
 
NOTE : When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form , available at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDev elopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to  be completed and faxed along  with any additional 
medical information to [PHONE_100].  The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy  agent( s) should be documented in 
the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
11.4. 6.1 Pregnancy  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 67 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs 
to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC . 
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby 
[CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report 
is required.  
 
11.4. 6.2 Fetal Death  
Fetal death , defined in CTCAE as “ A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_293861]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation ”, needs to 
be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss) ”. Do NOT report a  fetal 
death as a Grade 5 event since  CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.  
 
11.4. 6.3 Death Neonata l  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life ” needs to be 
reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “General disorders and 
administration - Other (neonatal loss) ” when the death is the result of 
a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do 
NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men on study  as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -
AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protoco l with a pre -existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines.  
 
a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the in vestigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required.  
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re -assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required.  
c. No modification in grading is to be mad e to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline.  
 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between 
treatment cycles/courses.  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 68 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
 
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becom es more severe in a subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade.  
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course.  
 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course.  
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course must be reported by [CONTACT_293862].  
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless:  
1) The grade increases OR  
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
11.6 Exceptions to  Expedited Reporting  
SPEER:  Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Events and 
Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected 
for CTEP -AERS reporting purposes. (Formerly referred to as the Agent Specific 
Adverse Event List (ASAEL).)  
 
AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by [CONTACT_293863] -AERS ONLY  if they exceed the grade of the event listed in 
parenthes es after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a combination IND using 
multiple investigational agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  
 
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is 
listed as expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be 
specified in the protocol. The protocol specific guidelines supersede th e NCI 
Adverse Event Reporting Guideli nes. These special situations are listed under the 
CTEP -AERS reporting Table A  for this protocol.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1255115] the 
primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention.  It is the responsibility of the  treating  
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report 
Form (CRF) within the study database.

the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is 
an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the inves tigator may jeopardize 
the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via 
CTEP -AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent administration.  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1255118] dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours .  
• Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_1255119] dose with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24  hours .  
 
CTEP -AERS Medical Reporting includes the following requirements  as part of the report : 
1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this 
study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the 
relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of

• For patients > 2 kg but  < [ADDRESS_1255141] 10  mL (one tube)  
• For patients <  2 kg researc h samples will not be collected   
In all cases, blood draw volumes should strictly adhere to institutional limitations , 
taking other blood draws into consideration.  However, if a reduction in volume is 
required, samples should be collected in 10 mL increments (ie . 0, 10, or [ADDRESS_1255142] is completely 
filled) . 
 
If patient consents for this biology study, peripheral blood will be required at the 
following time points:  
• Study entry ( within 7 days  prior to treatment start)

16.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING   
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) f or valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except 
where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

* Repeat tumor imaging if necessary.  
** For patients with bilateral lung metastases, who undergo consecutive lung 
surgeries  for metastasectomies , baseline post-operative CT chest should be 
performed after the last surgical procedure performed to achieve complete 
remission.  
 
NOTE: Patients with new lesions or progression of any pre -existing small 
lesions, on any follow up imaging: if these lesions do not unequivocally 
represent tumor progression as per RECIST 1.1 (e.g., very small size; positive

Version date: 05/17/[ADDRESS_1255151]/MRI changes) then patients 
should  undergo  confirmatory imaging 4 weeks after the initial evaluation 
demonstrating a confirmed progression  (additional imaging time point)  or 
histological confirmation of progression by [CONTACT_895395]. 
 
CT and MRI guidelines are available on the COG Member site at: 
http://member s.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/reference/RefMaterial/Diagno
sticImagingGuidelines_MRI&CT.pdf  
If possible, MRI should include diffusion weighted scans (parameters e.g. 
(TR/TE/b -value=6400ms/55ms/0, 600 -800). Apparent diffusion coefficient 
(ADC) maps sho uld be generated and submitted for central review. Tumor ADC 
values will be calculated for different time points before and after therapy.  
 
Two-view plain radiographs of the primary tumor site can be performed for 
patients who have a metallic prosthetic implant instead of CT or MRI if a 
significant metal artifact would occur by [CONTACT_895396]. If there is 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_895372], CT or MRI should be 
performed to confirm tumor recurrence.   
 
MDP bone scintigraphy  
• Whole body bone scintigraphy should be performed and include planar 
images of the skeleton, including anterior and posterior views of the axial 
skeleton. Anterior and/or posterior views should be obtained of the 
appendicular ske leton.  
• Delayed (skeletal phase) images should be performed in all cases with flow 
and blood pool images as per local custom and clinical need.  
• Dose Administration: Dose administered should be according to standard 
weight -based protocols. Injection site  should be away from lesion extremity 
or contralateral extremity if flow imaging is to be performed. Three -phase 
imaging is not required unless warranted by [CONTACT_293867] a focal lesion to 
assess hyperemia.  
• Imaging Parameters: Whole body delayed imaging i s acquired 2 -3 hours 
after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Spot views should be acquired of 
specific sites of symptoms or of any sites of abnormality as warranted by [CONTACT_895397].  
• Single -photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is recomm ended, 
but not required, particularly in cases with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_895373].  
• SPECT Imaging: SPECT should be performed of the lesion site. SPECT 
imaging should be performed as recommended by [CONTACT_895398]. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_895374] 360° circular orbit, 60 –
120 stops, 64 ´ 64 ´ 16 or greater matrix, and 10 –40 s/stop. An equivalent 
total number of counts should be acquired if continuous acquisition is used.  
• Special Consideration: Imaging of pelvis can be difficult due to overlying 
bladder activity. To lessen this problem, repeat imaging can be performed 
immediately after patient voiding. Bladder catheterization may be used, but 
should be reserved for patients in whom visualization of the pelvis is 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 86 
Version date: 05/17/[ADDRESS_1255152] a cquisition of the pelvis: Single or multiple rapid (5 -
10 min/acquisition) SPECT acquisition(s) are preferred to avoid artifacts 
caused by [CONTACT_895399]. Bladder artifacts are exaggerated 
in the plane in which the SPECT acquisition begins  and ends. Beginning 
SPECT acquisition with the camera heads in the left and right lateral 
positions (for dual -head camera) or posterior position (for single -head 
camera) will help reduce bladder filling artifact.  
 
18FDG PET or bone scan is required  at baseline and following Cycle [ADDRESS_1255153] 4 hours prior to injection of FDG. FDG PET 
imaging may follow a MUGA study on the same day, or FDG PET imaging may 
be performed on the day preceding this study. Plasma glucose shoul d be checked 
and, if the patient is hyperglycemic (plasma glucose > 250  mg/dL), appropriate 
treatment with small doses of insulin may be given to bring the plasma glucose 
into the normal range prior to FDG PET imaging. However, insulin administration 
may r esult in excessive muscle uptake of FDG and consequent tumor non -
visualization. If possible, the study should be postponed until the plasma glucose 
is under better control.  
 
Good hydration is required, as the primary route of FDG excretion is renal. The 
patient should drink water or receive intravenous fluids (not containing dextrose) 
after FDG injection to promote urinary excretion of the radioactive substrate. After 
injection, the patient must be kept in a resting state for 45 -60 minutes prior to 
imaging.  The patient should empty the bladder immediately prior to imaging.  
 
Imaging Technique  
The technique will vary by [CONTACT_293871]. In general, FDG is 
administered intravenously at a dose of 0.125 -0.200  mCi/kg or by [CONTACT_895400], with a minimum total dose of 2.0  mCi and 
maximum total dose of 20.0  mCi.  
 
The body should be imaged from the top of the ears to the bottom of the feet. If 
there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_293836], the vo lume that is 
imaged should be expanded.  
 
Imaging with a dedicated positron emission tomograph/computed tomography 
(PET/CT) camera is standard.   
 
The length of time needed to perform head to toe CT will depend on the patient’s 
height but will be approxima tely [ADDRESS_1255154] to patient positioning, the arms can 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1421  
Page 87 
Version date: 05/17/2017  
be placed in a comfortable position at the patient’s sides as long as they fit into the 
field of view. If the patient is large it may be necessary to lay the arms across the 
abdomen and hold in position with a stabilizing device.  
 
Study Processing  
The FDG PET study is processed for display by [CONTACT_293873]. FDG activity should be corrected for attenuation, scatter, and 
radioactiv e decay. Attenuation correction is necessary, as apparent uptake will 
otherwise vary with depth of the lesion in the body and the nature of surrounding 
tissues. The procedure used for attenuation correction should be recorded. The 
level of tumor uptake is assessed subjectively by [CONTACT_293874] -
quantitatively by [CONTACT_541075] (SUV). Uptake time, 
glucose levels, and partial volume effects influence both methods. The SUV 
method is also dependent on body weight, and co rrection of SUV by [CONTACT_293876] (BSA) reduces this dependency on body weight. SUVs 
should be calculated for lesions known to be 1.[ADDRESS_1255155] underestimated SUVs due to partial volume averaging effects at 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_293837] (0.6 -1.2 cm). 
 
To calculate the SUV, a region of interest (ROI) should be carefully drawn around 
as much of the area of elevated FDG uptake as can be done. The SUV should be 
calculated as SUV BSA = ROI activity concent ration (nCi/cc) x BSA / injected 
activity (nCi). SUV MAX is obtained by [CONTACT_895401][INVESTIGATOR_293838].  
 
The BSA is calculated from body mass (kg) and height (cm) using an appropriate 
algorithm. The SUV BSA for each measured lesion should be recorded and the 
technique for assessing SUV BSA should be consistent on follow -up studies.

APPENDIX II: YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY  AOST1421  
(for subjects from 7 through 12 years of age)  
A study  of a new drug to treat children with osteosarcoma that has come back.  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your  illness, osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer 
that grows in the cells that produce bones . Your cancer  came back  after treatment. After it came 
back you had surgery to remove tumors . 
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because your cancer came back . A re search study 
is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick.  We are trying to 
learn more about how to treat cancer that came back  after treatment . We will do this by [CONTACT_895404] . We do not know if this treatment will keep the cancer from coming back . That is why 
we are doing this study.  
 
3. Children  and teens on  this study will be given two  drugs. You will also have tests to see if the 
cancer comes  back during your treatment. We also want to learn more abou t how children’s bod ies 
handle  one of  the drugs you will receive. To do this , we will collect extra blood samples. These 
samples will be drawn through your central line if you have one . Collecting these blood samples 
may involve extra needle sticks.  
 
4. Somet imes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is your cancer will 
not come back but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit  of being part of this study.  
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” One risk to you is that the study treatment may not work or stop your tumor from 
growing or coming back . Anothe r risk is that you may have more side effects than you would on 
another therapy. We do know that the study treatment can cause a lot of pain so you will also be 
given drugs  to help lower  the pain. The drugs that fight pain will be given before, during and after 
treatment . Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about.  
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatme nts for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
7. We want to see if there are ways to tell how the cancer will respond to treatment. We are asking 
your permission to collect extra blood samples. These samples would be taken when other blood 
samples are being taken, so there would be no extra needle sticks . We would also like to collect 
tumor tissue to keep for other studies later on. This tissue would be taken when you have surgery, 
so there would be no extra surgeries. You can still take part in this study even if you don't allow us 
to collect the extra b lood samples or tissue for research.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY  AOST1421  
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age)  
A study  of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) to treat patients with recurrent 
osteosarcoma.  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that grows 
in the bones . Recurrent means that the cancer has come back after treatment. After doing tests, we have 
found that you have this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are ask ing you to take part in a research study because you have r ecurrent osteosarcoma  and t he 
tumor(s) that came back have now been removed by [CONTACT_44850].  A research study is when doctors work 
together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this study , we are trying to learn more 
about how to treat osteosarcoma that has come back. We will do this by [CONTACT_895405]14.18 (dinutuximab) along with a drug called sargramostim . Both drugs  are FDA -approved, 
but not for osteosarcoma  treatment . We don’t know for sure if these two drugs together will keep the 
tumor from coming back. That is why we are doing this study.  
 
3. Children, teens and young adults who are part of this study will be given  ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and 
sargr amostim . You will have imaging tests to see if the cancer comes  back during your treatment. We 
will collect blood samples  for research tests . We are trying to learn how child, teenage and young adult 
bodies handle dinutuximab . This study may help subjects who receive this drug in the future. These 
blood tests will be drawn through your central line if you have one. Otherwise, collecting these blood 
samples will involve extra needle sticks.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a rese arch study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that you r cancer will not 
come back, but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” Being in this study may involve special risks, which your doctor will discuss with you. 
The risks to you from this study are that the study treatment  may no t stop your tumor from growing or 
coming back . It is also possible that the study treatment may cause more side effects than other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Your doctors will monitor you closely for signs of any side effects. We do know that the 
study treatment can cause a lot of pain so you will be given  pain medication  to help reduce  the pain.  
Pain medication will be given before, during and after treatment as needed. Other things may happen 
to you that we don’t yet know about.  
 
6. You or your family can choose to be  part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. Please talk this over with your parents. There may be other 
treatments for your illness that your doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask yo ur doctors any 
questions that you have.  
 
7. We are asking your permission to collect additional blood. We want to see if there are ways to tell how 
the cancer will respond to treatment. These blood samples would be taken when other standard blood 
tests are be ing performed, so there would be no extra needle sticks . We would also like to collect tumor 
tissue to keep for other studies later on. This tissue would be taken when you have surgery, so there 
would be no extra surgeries. You can still take part in this study even if you don't allow us to collect 
the extra blood samples or tissue for research.

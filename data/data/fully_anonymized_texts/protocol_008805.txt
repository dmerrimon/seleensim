Study Title  
Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2).  
A randomized, double -blind , controlled factorial clinical trial of edetate disodium -based 
chelation and high -dose oral vitamins and minerals to prevent recurrent cardiac events 
in diabetic patients  with a prior myocardial infarction (MI).  
Objectives  
TACT2 is being carried out to re plicate TACT , which found a reduction of recurrent 
cardiovascular events in post -MI diabetic patients  receiving edetate disodium -based 
chelation therapy.   
 
The primary obje ctive of TACT2, therefore, is to determine if the chelation -based 
strategy increases  the time to the first occurrence of any of the components of the 
TACT2 primary endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary 
revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34067].  
 
The secondary objectives of TACT2 are to determine:  
  
1. if the chelation -based strategy reduces the overall rate of occurrence of the 
events which define the primary TACT2 endpoint : all-cause mortality, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, coronary revascularizatio n, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34068].  
2. if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to the first occurrence of a 
composite endpoint: cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, or 
stroke compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
3. if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to all -cause mortality compared 
to placebo chelation strategy.  
  
Design and Outcomes   
TACT2 is a 2x2 factorial trial testing 40  weekly edetate disodium -based che lation 
infusions and twice -daily high -dose oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) in a 
placebo -controlled design.   
 
The primary endpoint is a composite of all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34069] . All randomized 
patients  will be followed until the end of the trial.  
 
The secondary endpoints for TACT2 include the following:  
 
Total number of CV events:  This endpoint will include all CV events from 
randomization to the end of the study.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  5 All-cause mortality:  All-cause mortality is a secondary endpoint for the trial, based 
upon its importance and the observed 43% relative risk mortality reduction by [CONTACT_34112] ( P=0.011) in the diabetic subgroup of TACT . 
 
Composite of cardiov ascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, or stroke:  
This composite secondary endpoint captures serious, irreversible, ischemic events. 
Chelation treatment led to a 40% relative reduction in risk ( P=0.017) in this endpoint in 
the diabetic subgrou p of TACT . 
 
Exploratory analyses, defined as those seeking to confirm a signal of benefit observed 
in TACT , or to develop mechanistic hypotheses for benefits of chelation expected in 
TACT2, include:  
i. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving OM VM compared with oral 
placebo  
ii. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving active chelation + active 
OMVM, compared with placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
iii. Analysis of markers of severity of diabetes (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 
microalbuminuria) throughout the infusion regimen  
iv. Analysis of lead and cadmium levels at multiple times during the infusion regimen  
v. Collection of  biospecimen s for the constitution of a  biorepository to permit future 
analyses yet to be conceived  
Sample Size and Population  
TACT2 has enrolled 1000 diabetic patients  50 years of age or older with a prior MI and 
a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less.  Patients  will be randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) to 
4 factorial groups, each with approximately 250 patients . TACT2 will use a simple 
randomization scheme. The four treatment groups are:  
 
1. Active chelation + active OMVM  
2. Active chelation + placebo OMVM  
3. Placebo chelation + active OMVM  
4. Placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
 
The study is targeting a population consisting of 40% women  and 18% minority 
subjects.

1.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of TACT2 are to determine:  
  
1. if the chelation -based strategy reduces the overall rate of occur rence of the events 
which define the primary TACT2 endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34070].  
2. if the chelation -based strat egy increases the time to the first occurrence of a 
combined secondary endpoint: cardiovascular mortality,  myocardial infarction, or 
stroke compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
3. if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to all -cause mortality compared to 
placebo chelation strategy.  
 
Exploratory analyses, defined as those seeking to confirm a signal of benefit observed 
in TACT , or to develop mechanistic hypotheses for benefits of chelation expected in 
TACT2, include:  
i. Analysis of the primary endp oint in patients  receiving OMVM compared with oral 
placebo  
ii. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving active chelation + active 
OMVM, compared with placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
iii. Analysis of markers of severity of diabetes (fasting glucose, H bA1c, 
microalbuminuria) throughout the infusion regimen  
iv. Analys es of lead and cadmium in blood and urine to:   
a. Compare the change in metal internal dose (blood lead and urine 
cadmium) in TACT2 participants, from infusion 1  to infusion 40 (or 1 year) 
in the active versus placebo infusion arms.  
b. Evaluate whether higher screening  metal internal dose (blood lead and 
urine cadmium) and the extent of depletion of those stores identify 
patients  more likely to benefit from chelation .  
v. Collection of biospecimens  for the constitution of a biorepository  to support future 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  7 mechanistic work.  Samples of blood (plasma and buffy coat) and urine will be 
stored at -80ºC in a secured biorepository to ensure their availability for the 
evaluation of future hypotheses that will be guided by [CONTACT_34113].  
The above metal collections and biorepository will serve to support analyses to 
determine whether post -infusion urine metal measurements, alone and in comparison to 
the corresponding pre -infusion measurements, have clinical significance for predicting 
outcomes and clinical benefit of chelation; and whether the suite of additional metal 
levels measured in blood and urine by [CONTACT_34114] -element 
analytic technique, some of which are not chelated by [CONTACT_34115], have clinical 
(prognostic) significance in preliminary testing  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.[ADDRESS_33485] clinical benefits in symptomatic CAD 
patients  in 1956  and 1961 .1-2 In the early 1960s, however, following a reappraisal by 
[CONTACT_34116],3 only alternative medicine practitioners continued to use chelation for 
prevention of complications of atherosclerosis based on their positive anecdotal 
experiences.4-6 Ultimately, academic authors published 3 small studies7-9 with an 
aggregate of <[ADDRESS_33486] the practice of chelation by [CONTACT_34117] ,11 patients  continued to seek, and some practitioners 
to administer, chelation therapy for a variety of medical conditions.5  
 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded TACT  in [ADDRESS_33487] chelation practice in the community also included the addition of oral 
supple ments to the intravenous treatments; hence the factorial design.[ADDRESS_33488] -MI patients , chelation alone led to an 18% reduction in a 
combined cardiovascular endpoint ( HR 0.82 (0.69, 0.99) P=0.035, 7 -year NNT=18) .13 
Patients  with diabetes had dramatic benefit from IV chelation (HR 0.59, (0.44 , 0.79 ), 
P=0.0002, 5 -year NNT=6.5).14 An analysis of the factorial groups demonstrated that the 
strategy of intravenous chelation plus OMVM yielded a 26% reduction over double 
placebo ( HR 0.74 (0.57 , 0.95 ), P=0.016, 5 -year NNT=12).[ADDRESS_33489] on public health and health care financing were the primary 
reasons for the Investigators’ desire to move forward with TACT2, in this case focusing 
on the patients  in whom the greatest benefit had been observed (Table 1). The 
investigators also felt that inclusion of an exploratory  mechanistic component to the 
clinical trial would be desirable. TACT2, therefore, if positive, will be a confirmatory 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  8 second trial of edetate disodium -based chelation for patients  with established coronary 
disease, and should provide  the groundwork for mechanistic hypotheses – that 
ubiquitous pro -oxidant toxic metals, especially  lead and cadmium, are associated with 
recurrent coronary events.16-[ADDRESS_33490] 
* Post -MI, age ≥ 50 years, creatinine ≤ 2.0; ** time -to-event. Primary endpoint:  time to death, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34071] ; MVM: Multivitamins & Multiminerals; NNT: number needed to treat to prevent an event.  
 
The OMVM versus placebo comparison demonstrated an 11% relative reduction in risk 
that was not statistically significant.[ADDRESS_33491] ratio by [CONTACT_2902] 10% each time OMVM is added to the chelation infusion. The 
TACT  vitamins included higher doses of the individual OMVM components than 
previously used in other trials, and the non -significant signal of potential benefit 
challenges current opi[INVESTIGATOR_34072].  Thus, the TACT2 
protocol  replicates the 2x2 factorial design initially used in TACT .  
One of the two factors in the 2x2 factorial design – OMVM – is not incorporated in a 
primary or a secondary ob jective of the trial, and appears  only in exploratory analyses . 
The reasons for this are as follows:  
1. A factorial design w ill allow us to discern whether there is replication of the effect 
of OMVM on clinical events.  
2. If there is an effect, the complex chelation strategy with [ADDRESS_33492] (assuming additive treatment effects) to the 
chelation vs placebo infusion comparison, which in TACT (diabetes) had a HR of 
0.59. The proposed sample  size will provide 85% power to detect a HR of 0.70 
for the primary endpo int, and 95% power to detect a HR of 0.65, both 
conservative estimates based on TACT results. In summary, if vitamins are not

2.2 Study Rationale  
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality 
in the [LOCATION_002], including in patients with diabetes. In 2012 there were 29.1 million 
diabetic patients in the US, including 27% of people age 65 or older.21 Of these, 6.4 
million had  coronary artery disease (CAD) and could potentially be eligible for the 
therapy to be tested in this application. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_34073], 68% of the 
223,000 di abetic patients who died in 2012 had heart disease as either the principal or 
contributing cause.  Compared with non -Hispanic whites, the risk of diagnosed diabetes 
is 70% higher among African Americans and 80% higher among Hispanics.[ADDRESS_33494] -MI patient  level. This finding alone has 
potentially major public health implications. From an economic perspective, diabetes  is 
a costly disease that consumes a large proportion of the national health care budget. In 
the US, 1 in 5 health care dollars is spent treating people with diabetes. The annual 
expenditure exceeds $245 billion (B), including $176B in direct costs and $[ADDRESS_33495] costs (disability, work loss, premature mortality).[ADDRESS_33496]. Only 5 -10% of an oral dose is absorbed in the body, 91% of an 
oral dose is recoverable from the feces, and 4% is recoverable from the urine .27 In 
blood, the drug is found i n the plasma compartment. EDTA does not appear to 
penetrate cells; it is distributed primarily in the extracellular fluid with only about 5% of 
the plasma concentration found in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. The half - life of EDTA is 20 to 60 
minutes. EDTA is excreted  primarily by [CONTACT_8212], with about 50% excreted in one 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  10 hour and over 95% within [ADDRESS_33497] none of the compound is metabolized.  
 
The biological effects of EDTA are due to t he formation of chelates with divalent and 
trivalent metals. The stability of the metal -EDTA complex is directly related to its pH – 
the higher the pH, the more stable the chelate. Intravenous infusions of edetate 
disodium result in the chelation of ionize d calcium.[ADDRESS_33498]  (below). 1gm of EDTA can effectively bind approximately 120  
mg of calcium. Among metals normally found as trace metals and metals present 
pathologically, EDTA has been demonstrated to bind and promote the excretion of 
cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and vanadium.29-30 Virtuall y all of the 
metals chelated by [CONTACT_34118] 24 hours.26 In the case of 
calcium, 28% is excreted during the infusion, 60% in the [ADDRESS_33499] in an intracellular compartment or 
protein -bound. However, there is an important, non -protein boun d component that may 
be chelated by [CONTACT_34119]. EDTA salts may promote the excretion of up to 10 mg/day 
of iron and increase urinary copper by [CONTACT_34120] 140%.[ADDRESS_33500] , and  
will be measured during the TACT2 infusion regimen.  
 
Preliminary data on metal excretion following a TACT2 infusion  
A preliminary study measured metal excretion after one infusion of placebo, and one of 
active chelation. Twenty  male participants (mean age 66, range 51 to 81) were recruited 
using the same criteria as in TACT  (post -MI, age >50, creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL). Urinary 
concentrations of 20 toxic metals (Al, Sb, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Cs, Gd, Hg, Pb, Ni, Pd, Pt, 
Te, Tl, Th, Sn , W, U) normalized to creatinine excretion were measured at baseline , for 
6 hours following a placebo infusion of 500 mL normal saline and 1.2% dextrose, and 
for [ADDRESS_33501]  
infusion, there was a striking 
increase in the urinary 
excretion of lead (mean 
3,926% increase, P<0.001; 
Figure A), cadmium (739% 
increase, P<0.001; Figure B), 
and nickel (131% increase, 
P<0.001). There was also a 
modest increase i n the urinary 
excretion of tin and thallium 
(30-40%; P<0.05). These 
preliminary data25 show that 

TACT2 Protocol  May 6, [ADDRESS_33502]  and proposed for 
TACT2, markedly increased excretion of lead and cadmium. Whether enhanced 
excretion of metals following repeated chelation infusions leads to a reduction in blood 
lead or pre -infusion urine cadmium (reflecting total body stores of each) is unknown, but 
will be identified by [CONTACT_34121]2.  
 
FDA safety information and labeling on edetate disodium  
Edetate disodium is an old drug for which no clear modern indication exists.  Its current 
approval, as listed on the FDA website ,[ADDRESS_33503]:  
 
“Edetate disodium is approved by [CONTACT_34122] (hypercalcemia) as well as for use among patients with heart 
rhythm problems due to intoxication with the drug, digitalis. ” [ADDRESS_33504] . EDTA was associated with few 
side effects and there were no differences in serious adverse events compared with 
placebo .13,14,34 Some of t he safety specifics are summarized below.  
 
 Calcium.  Hypocalcemia, defined as a calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL prior to 
an infusion, was reported in 52 chelation patients (6.2%) and 30 placebo patients 
(3.5%) ( P=0.008). One patient, non -diabetic, had symptomatic hypocalcemia 
associated with muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_34074]. With 
regards to bone health, there were 2 fractures in the patients receiving the full 
chelation strategy and 2 fractu res in those receiving double placebo ( P=1.00). 
Although no safety signal pertaining to bone health was found in TACT , the effect 
of chelation on calcium makes it appropriate to measure calcium during the 
infusion period, as well as designate fractures as an event of interest and 
specifically query for it at regular intervals in the clinic visits and the telephone 
follow -up.  
 Kidney. An abnormal creatinine during the infusion phase was reported in fewer 
3/839 (0.4%) placebo patients than chelation 9/868 (1% ) patients ( P=0.093). 
Because EDTA is renally excreted, creatinine will be followed during the infusion 
period.  Vitamin C in high doses has been associated with oxalate kidney stones, 
and this was a rare complication in TACT . 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  12  Liver . There were no significa nt differences in liver enzyme abnormalities in the 
chelation compared with the placebo group.  Liver function will therefore not be 
monitored after the screening  study.  
 Hematology . There were no significant differences in abnormalities of 
hematologic parameters (white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelet count) in 
EDTA compared with placebo groups. Complete blood counts will be assessed 
at screening , infusion 20, and at the end of  the infusion period or 1 year.  
 Hypoglycemia . There was [ADDRESS_33505] hypoglycemic events  due to the treatment of their diabetes , we hav e 
retained this potential adverse event in the ICF.  
 Death . There were 2 deaths attributed by [CONTACT_34123]: [ADDRESS_33506]  has been retained in the ICF.  
 
Safety – chelation infusions in the population with diabetes:  In the patients  with 
diabetes, chelation was as safe as in the non -diabetic population. There were 95 
serious adverse events (non –endpoint events) in the population with diabetes mellitus 
(56 chelation placebo and 39 chelation active).  
 
Safety – Oral multivitamins and mu ltiminerals:  Serious adverse events occurred in 
124 (15%) vitamin recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 103 (12%) placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (difference, 3 
percentage points [95%CI=0.7 to 5.7 percentage points]). Adverse events included 12 
(1.4%) incident neoplasms in the vitamin group and 11 (1.3%) in the placebo group 
(difference, 0.1 percentage point [95%CI= 0.8 to 1.3 percentage points]). No evidence 
suggested harm from vitamin therapy in any category of adverse events.  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
TACT2, like TACT , is a 2X2 double -blind, placeb o-controlled multicenter international 
(US and Canada) factorial trial testing 40 -weekly edetate disodium -based chelation 
infusions and twice daily OMVM.  On December 31, 2020, TACT2 completed enrollment.  
The study  enroll ed 1000 diabetic patients  50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a 
serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. The factorial design was selected for TACT2 
because it replicates the TACT  design and it provides the most information about the 
independent contributions of the chelati on and OMVM factors.  Patients  will be randomly 
allocated (1:1:1:1) to 4 factorial groups:  
 
1. Active chelation + active OMVM  
2. Active chelation + placebo OMVM  
3. Placebo chelation + active OMVM  
4. Placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
 
Patients  will be followed for clinic al events until the beginning of the analysis phase, [ADDRESS_33507] occurrence of any of the components of the TACT2 
primary endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary 
revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34075] t he placebo 
chelation strategy.  
 
The secondary objectives of TACT2 are to determine:  
  
1. if the chelation -based strategy reduces the overall rate of occurrence of the 
events which define the primary TACT2 endpoint : all-cause mortality, myocardial 
infarction,  stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34068].  
2. to determine if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to the first 
occurrence of a combined secondary endpoint: cardiovasc ular mortality, recurrent 
myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
3. to determine if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to all -cause 
mortality compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
 
Additional analyses, defined as those seeking to confirm a signal of benefit observed in 
TACT , or to develop mechanistic hypotheses for benefits of chelation expected in 
TACT2, include:  
i. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving OMVM compared w ith oral 
placebo  to determine whether the signal of OMVM benefit is reproduced  
ii. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving active chelation + active 
OMVM, compared with placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  to determine if 
combination therapy has a greater effect size, as observed in TACT  
iii. Analysis of markers of diabetes (fasting glucose, HbA1c, microalbuminuria) 
throughout the infusion regimen  to determine whether changes in diabetes 
control or microvascular  effects may be associated with the TACT2 results  
iv. Analysis of lead and cadmium levels collected at multiple times during the 
infusion regimen to assess whether toxic metal removal is associated with the 
TACT2 results  
v. Collection of a specimen biorepository to permit future analyses yet to be 
conceived

Enrollment of Women and Racial and Ethnic Minorities  
The TACT2 investigators are committed to recruitment of a representative sample of 
women and minority subjects  as required by [CONTACT_4289] , and we understand that fa ilure to do 
so will decrease the validity and generalizability of study results. TACT2 is well 
positioned to achieve its goals of enrolling subjects representative of the US population. 
We are selecting patients  for study that are age 50 or older, which ha s the corollary 
benefit of achieving a more equivalent distribution of men and women for whom 
coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death. Moreover, we anticipate 
randomizing patients  who predominantly have Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Compared w ith 
non-Hispanic whites, the risk of diagnosed diabetes is 70% higher among African 
Americans and 80% higher among Hispanics, which also has the corollary effect of 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_34076] a sample that is sufficiently representative of these minority 
popula tions. TACT2 will target enrollment of at least 40% women and 18% minority 
subjects, which is in line with the demographics of prevalent myocardial infarction (MI) 
in the US population and the realities of enrolling women and minorities, as shown by 
[CONTACT_34127].  
 
Targeted Enrollment of Women  
We are committed to enrolling sufficient numbers of women so that the results of 
TACT2, if positive, will be plausibly applicable to women. The target proportion of 
women to be enrolled in TACT2 is lowe r than the overall proportion of women in 
estimates from the 2010 US Census (51%) ,36 but it is consistent with current estimates 
of the proportion of prevalent MI among women, especially those with diabetes. Based 
upon cardiovascular disease (CVD) surveillance from 1994 -1997 in the NHLBI 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, one of the largest NHLBI population 
cohort studies and CVD surveillance programs, 32% (n=4,253) of 13,[ADDRESS_33515] -menopausal in vitro 
fertilization or other reproductive technology.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  16 Disease and Stroke Statistics update from the American Heart Association (AHA) 
reported a similar proportion of prevalent MI in women (34%).38-39 Gore et al.,40 based 
on the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), reported  that 44.8% of incident 
MIs in diabetics occurred in women, with an 8.4% in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34077].  Perhaps more to the point of the attainable, the FREEDOM 
Trial41 reported its results in 2012.  This was an NIH study o f revascularization strategies 
in diabetic patients  with multivessel coronary disease. There were 1900 patients  
enrolled, and 29% were women (Similar to ARIC, above).  The TACT2 leadership has 
carefully considered the population goal as reported by [CONTACT_34128], an d the attainable goal 
from FREEDOM.  While we believe we can improve on FREEDOM, we do not 
realistically believe we can enroll a population fully reflective of Gore et al.  Thus, our 
goal of enrolling at least 40% women in the TACT2 trial is justified.37-41 
 
Targeted Enrollment of Minorities  
Our goal for enrollment of minorities is more reflective of the Gore data, which reported 
18.2% minorities in the NRMI diabetes dataset.  This proportion included 9% black and 
3.4% Hispanics. Overall, the TACT2 enrollment target of 18% for minority patients  is 
justified based on these data and is in accord with published data on the proportion of 
minority patients  with prevalent MI used by [CONTACT_34129], ACC -NCDR and VAMC.37-[ADDRESS_33516] different approaches.  These plans will form 
part of a living document external to this Protocol, entitled “Plans to Identify, Recruit, 
Enroll, and Retain Women & Minorities.”   
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Chelation/placebo infusions:  The active infusi on contain s up to [ADDRESS_33517]  of 500 ml normal saline with 1.2% 
dextrose. Infusions are administered weekly for 40 weeks.12 More detail s can be found  
in the Manual of Procedures  (MOP ). 
The dose of edetate disodium in the infusion solution will be adjusted based o nf 
estimated creatinine clearance and ideal body weight (IBW), but in no case will ever 
exceed 3 grams per infusion (3000mg):  
EDTA dose (mg)  = [50mg x (IBW x 1.33) x min (100, creatinine clearance)]  ÷100  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  17  
The IBW is calculated based on the Devine formula:44 
 For men the weight is computed as 50 kg plus 2.3 kg for each inch of height 
over 5 feet (or 60 inches).  
 For women the weight is computed as 45.5 kg plus 2.3 kg for each inch of 
height over 5 feet (or 60 inch es). 
 Actual body weight is used whenever it is less than computed ideal body 
weight.  
 
Correction for creatinine clearance should only be done if creatinine clearance is 
less than 100.   
 
Creatinine clearance will be computed by [CONTACT_2329] a modified version of t he Cockcroft -Gault 
equation:  
 
Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) =     (140 - age) x (IBW X 1.33)     
(72 x Cr)  
 
Creatinine Clearance = computed renal glomerular filtration rate in ml/min  
Age = patient ’s age  
IBW = computed weight in Kg  
Cr = serum creatinine in  mg/dL  
For women, multiply the above result by 0.[ADDRESS_33518] the EDTA for the patient ’s next scheduled infusion.  
 
Serum calcium is corrected by [CONTACT_34130] a corrected calcium value that 
is an estimation of ionized calcium45 as follows:  
 
corrected calcium = serum calcium + (0.8 x [normal serum albumin - patient ’s 
albumin])  
 
calcium= mg/dL  
albumin= g/dL  
 
 When corrected calcium is greater than 8.5 mg/100mL, the infusion is 
administered over 3 hours.  
 When corrected calcium is between 8 and 8.5, the infusion is administered over 4 
hours.  
 When corrected calcium is less than 8, the next infusion is not administered and 
serum calcium is rechecked at least 1 week later.  When corrected calcium is 
within acc eptable range, infusions continue. This usually leads to a 2 week delay 
in infusions.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  18  
OMVM/placebo : The OMVM consists of [ADDRESS_33519] of microcrystalline cellulose, stearic acid, 
croscarmellose sodium, silica  and magnesium stearate.  OPADRY® II complete film 
white coating, magnesium stearate and vanilla flavor  are used to coat both active and 
placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] . These caplets are  taken for the entire duration of the study.  
 
Low-dose vitamins : The low -dose supplement s are taken by [CONTACT_34131].  They 
consist of: vitamin B6, chromium, copper, manganese, and zinc. As was done in TACT , 
all patients  will receive a low -dose regimen consisti ng of a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_34078], stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] [ADDRESS_33520].  The low -dose regimen consists 
of: vitamin B6 [ADDRESS_33521] 3 hours.  Due to vacations, travels, weather, and illness, 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  19 the infusion regimen can be extended but is expected to  be completed by 1 year.  
Clinical sites, however, will be instructed that if a patient  has not completed the 
infusions by 1 year, they should continue  trying to get the patient  to clinic until the 40th 
infusion is complete.  The total number of infusions is  key, not the weekly schedule on 1 -
year completion.  The overall goal of the treatment schedule is to deliver all 40 
infusions; no matter how long it takes.  The DCRI Call Center will follow patients  for 
clinical events, but not for  infusion scheduling or other site-centered events beginning [ADDRESS_33522]’s home.  In order to better preserve the blind and improve vitamin compliance , 
the study vitamin s will be packaged in one month bottles and in individual  dose packs . 
Vitamin compliance will be estimated  by [CONTACT_34132] ( EDC ) system . The 
details will be covered in the MOP . 
 
Managing Patient  Safety During the Infusion Encoun ter 
Blood samples for safety will be collected during infusion visits as seen in the schedule 
below.  
 
Hypoglycemia  – Among [ADDRESS_33523] hypo and hyperglycemia 
based on the nature of their disease and its treatment.  There is no exp ectation that 
patients with diabetes are prone to hypoglycemia from active or placebo treatment.  
 
Some pa tients using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) may have incorrect readings  
due to the contents of the active/placebo infusion . This could result in either not giving 
insulin when it is needed or giving too much insulin. To avoid insulin -dosing errors due an 
incorrect CGM reading, patient s will be directed do the following:  
 
 Do not depend on the results of CGMs  for insulin dosing  while receiving an infusion 
and for up to [ADDRESS_33524] infusion; finger  stick measurements are recommended in 
that timeframe.  
 
 Users of a closed loop insulin pump system should set the pump to manual mode for 
24 hours starting at the time of the infusion , and use finger  stick measurements in 
that timeframe . 
 
Hypocalcemia  – All sites will have training in how to recognize symptoms of 
hypocalcemia, and additionally have available calcium chloride or calcium gluconate for 
intravenous administration. Should hypocalcemia be suspected during an infusion,  the 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, [ADDRESS_33525] blood drawn and be treated. The CCC 
should be called for a joint evaluat ion (with the site coordinator and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461])  
of the symptoms and result  of the serum calcium drawn during the event before 
scheduling the next infusion. Symptomatic hypocalcemia requiring an ER visit was 
observed only once in TACT .  
 
Fluid overload  – Patients  are excluded from TACT2 if they are thought likely to be 
intolerant  to [ADDRESS_33526] and 
carefully tracked and compared between groups.  
 
Recommended Safety Materials  
Clinical Sites should ensure the following safety materials are available during 
administration of infusions:  
 
 Snacks or juice for empi[INVESTIGATOR_34079]  
 Intravenous dextrose 50%  
 Intravenous calcium gluconate or chloride  
 Glucometer for measuring glucose levels  
5.[ADDRESS_33527] -MI evidence -based medications, specifically anti -platelets, statins, beta -
blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and aldosterone blockers are encouraged , if indicated 
based on clinical need as assessed by [CONTACT_102] ’s physician . All necessary 
cardiovascular procedures are allowed.  All conve ntional diabetes management is 
permitted  with a focus on optimal glucose control while avoiding epi[INVESTIGATOR_34080]2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  21 hypoglycemia.  Recommended medical treatment for secondary cardiovascular 
prevention and diabetes management will form part of a living document outs ide the 
study protocol, that will be updated annually  (Suggested Management of TACT2 
Patients ) and circulated to sites.  
 
5.3.2 Prohibited Interventions  Following randomization  
i. Effective , FDA -approved,  oral chelation at any time during  the course of the trial.  
ii. Intravenous chelation , outside of the TACT2 intervention , at any time during the 
course of the trial.   
iii. Over -the-counter vitamins having any of the same components as do the TACT2 
vitamins . In patients who are unwilling to discontinue outpatient vitamins, or 
whose participation in the infusion regimen is dependent on their continuing to 
take out of protocol oral vitamins, the CCC may grant a waiver based on 
discussion with site staff.  
iv. Injecta ble vitamins such as the  Myers’ cocktail unless medically necessary (i.e. 
pernicious anemia).  In patients whose participation in the infusion regimen is 
dependent upon their permission to receive a Myers’ cocktail no more than once 
monthly, the CCC may gra nt a waiver based on discussion  with site staff.  
 
Exception:  Vitamin D 3 prescribed f or bone health , along with calcium , may be taken and 
will be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Assessing infusion adherence : the site coordinators will enter in the eCRF if the infusion 
was completed.  In cases where the infusion was started and not completed, the site 
coordinator will estimate whether more or less than ½ of the infusion was infused.  
 
Assessing OMVM adherence : During the study , OMVM will be delivered every [ADDRESS_33528] 6 OMVM/placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_34081]. Each bottle  will have 
30 dose packs.  At designated  intervals during the study , the patient ’s compliance will be 
assessed.   
 
Assessing low -dose vitami n adherence : The low -dose regimen is to be taken during the 
infusion phase only . The subjects  should take one  low-dose  pi[INVESTIGATOR_34082].  When patients  are 
non-compliant with this regimen they will be advised by [CONTACT_34133] .

6.1.2  Laboratory Procedures  
The TACT2 laboratory procedures include safety monitoring, diabetes monitoring labs, 
and additional  labs (metals and biorepository). Abnormalities in the safety lab  results 
collected will be comp iled and reported to the DSMB. Biosample processing, analysis , 
storage, and data management details are covered in the separate MOP for each 
laboratory.  
 
In brief, there are 2 types of blood and urine specimens that will be sent for analysis:  
 
1. Safety labs will be sent to study central laboratory . 
2. Blood and urine for metals analyses and for preparation and storage will be 
sent to the TACT2 Biorepository. The Biorepository will be responsible for 
processing and storage of samples during the study and intermittent batch 
transfer of urine and blood samples  to the anal ysis laboratory .  
 
Safety Laboratory collection at the Clinical Site  
Blood and urine samples will be colle cted at screening, infusion 5, 10, 20, [ADDRESS_33530] the medical history reviewed 
by [CONTACT_464], and blood and urine sample s will be drawn.  Eligibility will be based on the 
following : 
 All inclusion criteria are met  
 No exclusion criterion is present   
Data collected will include relevant cardiac history, particularly of the qualifying MI 
(anterior or non -anterior), whether patients  have Type [ADDRESS_33531] infusion  
A simple randomization scheme reflecting an equal  allocation ratio to the four different 
treatment groups (1 active chelation / active OMVM: 1 active chelation / placebo 
OMVM: 1 placebo chelation / active OMVM: 1 placebo chelation / placebo OMVM) will 
maximize the power for detecting treatment difference s at the time of the interim and 
final analyses . 
 
Patients who are confirmed eligible to participate in TACT2 will be notified  by [CONTACT_34134] . The patient  will be randomly assigned to a blinded treatment group by 
[CONTACT_27950] (this is the randomization  date),  and the first infusion visit will be 
scheduled . The allowable range of time during which all screening activity  (defined by 
[CONTACT_34135])  must be completed is [ADDRESS_33532] infusion visit  
This visit will involve collection  of urine and blood for metals and biorepository . The 
biorepository will provide specific labels identifying patient  number, infusion number, 
sample type, including kits with metal -free urine and metal -free blood collection 
containers. More  detail about blood and urine collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_34083] . 
6.2.3 Subsequent Infusion  Visits  (2-40) 
The detailed schedule and activities of the follow -up visits are covered in Section 6.1 
(Table 2).  Within the infusion period in Year 1, most visits are associated with an 
infusion number, and do not have a traditional time -window for performance.   
 
 
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  25 During the infusion year, the only time -dependent visit landmarks in TACT2 are:  
 
1. The first infusion, which should occur within [ADDRESS_33533] stopped receiving infusions, 
a urine / blood sample within [ADDRESS_33534] infusion is informative 
regarding their metal levels at the time the patient stopped infusions. The CCC 
should be consulted for all non -adherent patients. The management of the non -
adherent patient will be c overed in detail in the MOP . 
 
The data collected in each call is covere d in the Table in Section 6.1.  
 
6.2.4 Blinding  
Blinding  
The shipped and refrigerated infusion pack age will contain an ascorbic acid syringe (or 
ascorbic acid placebo if the patient  is assigned to the placebo arm), one syringe with 
EDTA (or EDTA placebo if the patient  is assigned to the placebo arm), and a bag for 
intravenous infusion with all the other components mixed (or a bag containing only 
normal saline if the patient  is assign ed to the placebo arm).  EDTA in solution is clear 
and of a viscosity indistinguishable by [CONTACT_34136].  Thus, the 
placebo -EDTA syringe will contain normal saline. The ascorbic acid solution is generally 
a pale yellow color, which, upon  mixing (14  ml of ascorbic acid solution in 500  ml) 
becomes indistinguishable from the clear saline placebo solution.  In addition, ascorbic 
acid, in the concentration provided by [CONTACT_3455], is viscous and provides 
resistance to transfer into the inf usion bag through a [ADDRESS_33535] the CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_34084]. Following these discussions, if the participant’s physician still 
desires unmasking, the CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_34085]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_34086] . The 
treatment assignment  will be made available to the treating physician.  The CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_34087], and a request will be made to the treating physician to maintain the 
patient  blind. These requests will be submitted and handled on a case -by-case basis , 
but will be entered  into the eCRF.  
  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, [ADDRESS_33536] infusion through end of follow -up. For all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], length of stay by 
[CONTACT_34137] (e.g., number of step down, intensive care nights) will be recorded 
along with major procedures. Discharge disposition for each acute care stay (e.g., 
home, skilled nursing, rehabilitation, nursing home, death) will be documented. In 
addition, dates of car e at non -acute care facilities (e.g., skilled nursing, rehabilitation, 
long-term care) will also be collected to the end of the study follow -up. The dates of 
significant out patient  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures will be recorded.  
 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
All of these assessments will be discussed in detail in site training and will be an 
important part of the MOP . 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Institutional Review Boards (IRB s) 
All TACT2 sites will submit the study protocol, informed consent form, and other study 
documents to their corresponding IRB for approval. Any amendments to the protocol, 
other than minor administrative changes, must be approved by [CONTACT_34138]2 DSMB and 
each I RB before they are implemented.   
7.[ADDRESS_33537]  amassed a substantial body of safety data. Edetate disodium was associated 
with few side effects and there were no differences in serious adverse events compared 
with placebo .13,14,34 The safety specifics are summarized below.  
 
 Calcium . Hypocalcemia, defined as a calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL prior to 
an infusion, was reported in 52 chelation patients (6.2%) and 30 placebo patients 
(3.5%) ( P=0.008). One patient, non -diabetic , had symptomatic hypocalcemia 
associated with muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_34074]. With 
regards to bone health, there were [ADDRESS_33538] acebo ( P=1.00). 
Although no safety signal pertaining to bone health was found in TACT , the effect 
of chelation on calcium makes it appropriate to measure calcium during the 
infusion period, as well as designate fractures as an event of interest and 
specifi cally query for it at regular intervals in the clinic visits and the telephone 
follow -up in TACT2.  
 Kidney . An abnormal creatinine during the infusion phase was reported in 3/839 
(0.4%)  chelation  patients and 9/868 (1%) placebo patients ( P=0.093). Because 
EDTA is renally excreted, creatinine will be followed during the infusion period.  
 Liver . There were no differences in liver enzyme abnormalities in the chelation 
compared with the placebo group.  Liver function will therefore not be monitored 
after the screening  study.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  27  Hematology . There were no significant differences in abnormalities of 
hematologic parameters (white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelet count) in 
EDTA compared with placebo groups. Complete blood counts will be assessed 
at screening , infusio n 20, and at infusion [ADDRESS_33539] -MI diabetic patients : In the 
patients  with diabetes, chelation was as safe as in the non -diabetic population. There 
were 95 serious adverse events (non–endpoint events) in the population with diabetes 
mellitus (56 chelation placebo and 39 chelation active).  
 
Safety – Oral multivitamins and multiminerals:  Serious adverse events occurred in 
124 (15%) vitamin recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 103 (12%) placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (difference, 3 
percentage points [95%CI=0.7 to 5.7 percentage points]). Adverse events included 12 
(1.4%) incident neoplasms in the vitamin group and 11 (1.3%)  in the placebo group 
(difference, 0.1 percentage point [95%CI=0.8 to 1.3 percentage points]). No evidence 
suggested harm from vitamin therapy in any category of adverse events.  
 
Routine safety labs : Study staff will review all laboratory values, includin g safety labs 
and diabetes monitoring labs.  Patients  and their physicians will be informed when 
laboratory values are abnormal if, in the judgment of the research team, a change in 
medical therapy is warranted, or the abnormal laboratory value has diagnost ic value of 
clinical importance.  These procedures are  covered in detail in the MOP . 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
Safety Labs and the TACT2 infusion regimen . 
The timing of safety labs is covered in section  6.1 (Schedule of  Evaluation s) 
 
Renal function.  Edetate disodium is excreted by [CONTACT_8212] , and the dose of edetate 
disodium administered  is adjusted  based on estimated creatinine clearance .[ADDRESS_33540] . 
In TACT2, each assessment of serum creatinine will potentially lead to a change in total 
edetate disodium dose f or the next series of infusions, with the following 2 “trigger 
points .” 
 
1. If estimated creatinine clearance is r educed by 25% or more  compared with 
baseline, there will be a “lab delay” transmitted to the site and to the CCC and 
DCC.  The site will be contact[CONTACT_34139] -the-counter supplement changes as well as  changes in 
clinical status that might account for a reduction in renal function, and the lab will 
be repeated.  The dose of edetate disodium will be recalculated before re -
administration.  This will be entered in the EDC system.  
2. If cre atinine doubles or exceeds 2.5 mg/dL, whichever is lower, the site will be 
contact[CONTACT_34140] -the-
counter supplement changes as well as changes in clinical status that might 
account for a reduction in r enal function, and the lab will be repeated. Infusions 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  28 will be resumed when  creatinine is <2.0 mg/dL  and the edetate disodium dose 
recalculated at that time . This will be entered in the EDC system.  
 
Calcium levels.  Edetate disodium chelates ionized calcium  and can lead to 
hypocalcemia.  In TACT , however, there was only one  epi[INVESTIGATOR_34088].  Calcium levels will be monitored, 
and if corrected calcium is between 8.0 mg/dL and 8.5 mg/dL, infusions will be 
administered over 4 hours, instead of 3 hours.  If corrected calcium is below 8.0 mg/dL, 
there will be a lab delay, and infusions will be held until calcium is 8.0 mg/dL or higher, 
based on bi-weekly blood draws.  This information will be entered in the EDC system.  
 
Metals labs  
The handling of the trace metals analyses and biorepository will be available in the 
MOP for each of these study units.  If the lead or cadmium levels measured by [CONTACT_34141] (ACGIH)47 (after a repeated measurement at the 
Trace Metals Laboratory) the clinical site and the CCC will be notified . In most cases, 
this will require repeating the levels in a commercial lab.  If levels a re still high, the 
participant will be recommended to contact [CONTACT_34142]. Because removal 
from exposure is the primary treatment, this should not interrupt the TACT2 infusions.  
The study sample is unlikely to have any such values.  
 
Clinical Assessments  
In TACT , the principal concern  that emerged related to the weekly infusions of 500 ml of 
fluid and the potential precipi[INVESTIGATOR_34089] (HF).  Patients  are not eligible for 
TACT2 if they have had a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34090] [ADDRESS_33541] infusion, or 5 lbs or more since the screening evaluation, the patient  
will be evaluated for heart failure. A trained study  coordinator or infusion nurse may 
perform this examination.  If there is HF present, this will be entered into the EDC, the 
infusion delayed for 1 week, and a suitable treatment regimen developed with the 
patient ’s clinical physician.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse even t is any undesired, noxious or pathological change in a patient  as 
indicated by [CONTACT_23804], symptoms, or laboratory changes that occur in association with the 
use of trial intervention/medication, whether or not considered drug or biologic related.  
This definition includes intercurrent illness or injuries, exacerbation of existing 
conditions, psychological events, psychosocial events, associated temporally 
associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product or study intervention. Pre-existing 
conditi ons, which worsen during a study, are considered adverse events and can 
become serious if they fulfil one of the seriousness criteria described below.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  29  
Note: Diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing at 
study admission ar e not considered adverse events when observed during the trial 
unless they represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency. (Definition modified 
from ICH -E2B)  
 
Assessment of Adverse Event Intensity  
The intensity of an adverse event is an estimate of the relative severity of the 
experience made by [CONTACT_34143].  The maximal intensity reported during the evaluation period 
should be recorded.  The intensity of adverse eve nts will be characterized as mild, 
moderate or severe as follows:  
 
Mild Events are usually transient, require no special treatment, and do 
not interfere with the patient ’s daily activities.  
Moderate  Events usually introduce a low level of inconvenience  or concern to 
the patient  and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  
Severe  Events interrupt a patient ’s usual daily activity and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  
 
Asse ssment of Causal Relationship  
A medically -qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE to the use of 
study drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
 
1. Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_34144]  
2. Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_34145], and ensure drug safety . 
 
Expectedness  
The expectedness of an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction shall be 
determined according to the most current investigator’s brochure or product label. 
“Expected” is defined as an adverse drug experience, the specificity and severity of 
which is consistent with the current investigator brochure or the risk information in the 
investigational plan. This term relates only to the drug, not the patient ’s underlying 
condi tion. Any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or specificity in the current 
study drug reference document(s) (e.g., investigator’s brochure) is considered 
unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the investigator's brochure as occurring with 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation are 
considered unexpected.  For example: Hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  30 investigational brochure or plan only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
(Adapted from 21 CFR Part 312. 32)  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if it results in any 
of the followi ng outcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening  
3. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
4. Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect   
6. Important medical events that may not result  in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34091], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may  jeopardize the patient 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. (Source CFR: 21 CFR 312.32 ) 
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
For laboratory test abnormalities that meet the definition of an SAE, that required the 
subject to have the investigational product discontinued or interrupted or required the 
subject to receive specific corrective therapy, the clinical diagnosis rather than the 
laboratory term will be used by [CONTACT_9673] (e.g., anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value).  
 
Life-Threatening  
Life-threatening refers to any adverse event that places the patient  at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  (Source CFR: 21 CFR 
312.32)  
 
Requires or Prolongs Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
A patient  must be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a period greater than 24 hours, for the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34093] a serious adverse event.  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], 
scheduled prior to the study, are not considered serious adverse events unless the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34094].  Planned admissions (as part of a study), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34095] 24 hours, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096], and Emergency 
Room/Department visits are not considered serious adverse events.  Exception: Any 
disposition o f the patient  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34097] 24 hours following 
study drug (infusion) therapy.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
The SAE reporting flow chart will be included in the MOP . 
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  31 Protocol Specific Exceptions to SAE Reporting  
Specified outcome eve nts in the study will be recorded in their respective appropriate 
modules of the eCRF. These events and specific corresponding symptoms will NOT 
require reporting as serious adverse events on the SAE eCRF. Specifically, the events 
covered in this exception  are as follows:  
 
1. Myocardial infarction  
2. Stroke  
3. Coronary revascularization  
4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34098]. All SAEs  must be reported from the time of randomization through [ADDRESS_33542] becoming aware of the event. The investigator or qualified designee will enter the 
required information regarding the SAE into the appropriate module of the eCRF. If the 
eCRF system is temporarily unavailable, the event, including the investigator -
determined causality to study drug will be reported via the back -up paper SAE form to 
DCRI Safety Surveillance at 1 -[PHONE_540]. Upon return of the availability of EDC 
system, the SAE infor mation must be entered into the eCRF.  
 
Adverse events that are serious and drug (infusion) therapy related or result in death 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_34146].  DCRI Saf ety Surveillance will review all SAE data 
including all deaths, within 1 -2 business days to:  
 
1. Ascertain seriousness  
2. Ascertain drug (infusion) therapy causal relationship  
3. Verify that all data are complete  
4. Follow -up with the site for incomplete data and/or data clarification.  
 
This will include, but will not be limited to , ensuring that serious criteria have been met 
and the SAE data received are reviewed, entered and coded using the MedDRA coding 
dictionary.  
 
DCRI Safety Surveillance will notify the study sponsors (NIH and TACT2 Principal 
Investigators from Mount Sinai and Duke Clinical Research Institute), and Data Safety 
Monitoring Board Chairman (DSMB)) in a blinded fashion, within 1 business day of 
receipt of the initial notification of the SAE, of:  
 All serious adverse events that are drug (infusion) therapy related – defined as 
taking place within 24 hours of an infusion, and attributed to the infusion by [CONTACT_34147] [INVESTIGATOR_34099], and/or  
 All SAEs resulting in death  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  32  
The DCRI Safety Surve illance will provide the DCRI Regulatory Services with the event 
specific forms necessary to report the expedited adverse event according to country 
specific regulatory guidelines. This will include all deaths assessed by [CONTACT_34148], unexpected and drug (infusion) therapy related (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_6962], DCRI Medical Monitor and TACT2 study leadership).  
 
Procedures for Enhance d Reporting of Specific Adverse Events  
DCRI Safety Surveillance will also report specific adverse and/or serious adverse 
events, not otherwise eligible for expedited SAE reporting as in Section 7.2, within 2 
business days to the DSMB or its designee, and t he NIH Program Officers. The adverse 
events for enhanced scrutiny include:  
 
1. Heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34100]’s 
participation in the study, not otherwise subjected to expedited SAE reporting.  
2. Any disposition of the patient to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34097] 24 
hours following study drug (infusion) therapy, not otherwise subject to 
expedited SAE reporting.   
 
These events would not be eligible for expedited SAE reporting if the causality criterion 
were not me t. Notification of these events will be made electronically . 
7.[ADDRESS_33543] patient  enrolled in the trial completes the study drug (infusion) therapy. At the time 
of database lock, unresolved SAEs may be closed (final outcome assigned as 
“unresolved”) per the discretion of the DCRI Medical Monitor and/or the DCC PI. The 
site investigator will be responsible for reporting adverse event s and unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects to their local IRBs/IECs in accordance with local 
regulations.  
7.[ADDRESS_33544] 2 times per year to review 
study progress and overall safety. For ethical reasons, an interim examination of key 
safety and endpoint data will be performed during the course of the trial. A separa te 
DSMB charter outlining the operating guidelines for the committee and the protocol for 
evaluation of data will be created prior to study enrollment and agreed upon during the 
initial meeting of the DSMB.  
 
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  33 8. INTERVENTION INTE RRUPTION   
Reasons for Withdrawal/  Interruption  
There may be reasons for subject withdrawal and/or interruption of the study infusions 
and/or OMVM.  
 
Some possible reasons are:  
 
 Died 
 Lost to follow -up  
 Informed consent withdrawal   
 
Subject adherence and retention strategies will be included in the site personnel 
training. Site personnel will be encouraged to have weekly communications with 
enrolled subjects as a means of continued participation. The site investigator should 
make every attempt to accommodate the subject to continue  the therapy where feasible 
and encourage subject to allow follow -up by [CONTACT_34149].  
  
Withdrawal Procedures  
Site study personnel must immediately communicate , with the CCC PI, all information 
from subjects that express desire to stop study treatment (either infusions or OMVM) , 
follow -up or  withdrawing informed consent.  When all attempts by [CONTACT_34150], the final disposition of a 
subject withdrawal from study treatment and /or follow -up will require  approval by [CONTACT_34151] . See the MOP for details.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues   
Analysis of the TACT2 2x2 factorial trial will be based  on intention to treat (ITT). That is, 
participants will be analyzed (and endpoints attributed) according to the treatment 
strategy to which participants are randomized, regardless of subsequent additional post -
randomization treatment and medical care. Sta tistical comparisons will be performed 
using two -sided significance tests. Treatment dropouts and consent withdrawals will be 
tracked by [CONTACT_34152] -up interval. Baseline  
demographic and clinical variables will be summar ized for each randomized arm of the 
study. Descriptive summaries of the distribution of continuous variables will be 
presented in terms of percentiles (e.g., median, 25th and 75th percentiles) along with 
means and standard deviations.  Categorical variables  will be summarized in terms of 
frequencies and percentages.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio using simple randomization.  
The study was originally designed  to enroll a total of 1200 participant s with a minimum 
follow -up of 12 months.  The DSMB conducted a blinded review of enrollment aggregate 
event rates , and projected event rates  in July 2019 . Following this blinded review, the 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  34 DSMB  recommended a reduc tion in t he target sample size to 1100 part icipants and an 
increase  in the m inimum follow -up from 1 year to approximately  2.5 years.  Due to 
slowed enrollment related to the COVID -19 pandemic, in the fall of 2020, the DSMB and 
the NIH leadership agreed to a proposal to complete enrollment by 12/31/2020 with an 
allowance to follow the study participants until there are enough primary endpoint 
events to maintain 85+% power.  
 
Several design factors and research objectives have been considered in developi[INVESTIGATOR_34101]2  study. First, patient  enrollment and follow -up has 
been determined so there would be a sufficient number of endpoints to provide a high 
degree of confidence for testing the primary hypothesis. Second, the statistical power 
for secondary endpoints has been  considered. Finally, the sample size has been 
determined to provide a reasonable level of confidence for detecting clinically important 
differences in outcome between treatment strategies even if current projections of event 
rates and hypothesized differe nces in clinical outcomes between the treatment groups 
prove to be optimistic.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_33545] 80% to 90% power with 
hazard ratios varying from 0.50 to 0.75. The two factors (EDTA chelation and OMVM) 
are assume d to be additive for the sample size calculations. Based on TACT  we 
anticipate  a hazard ratio of 0.70 (active chelation vs. placebo chelation) to determine the 
sample size requirements. This hazard ratio assum ption is very conservative compared 
to the observed effect in TACT . Assuming a two -sided 0.05 type I error rate and 
approximately 5% consent withdrawal or loss -to-follow -up per year, the final sample 
size of 1000 participants  will provide approximately 85%  power to detect a hazard ratio 
of 0.70 for the primary endpoint of time to all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34102]. placebo chelation.

Calculations performed using nQuery 7.0 and assume a 0.05 type I error rate (two-sided) with 1:[ADDRESS_33546] blood and urin e samples available from baseline  
and one or more follow -up time points.  A sample size of 250 participants per group will 
provide 80% or greater power for any between group differences greater than ¼ of a 
standard deviation.  These calculations are based on  a two -sample t -test and assume a 
two-sided type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_33547] any requested statistical analyses and prepare a summary report along with the 
following information: patient  enrollment reports, rates of adherence w ith the assigned 
treatment, and description of SAEs (statistical comparisons of the randomized arms with 
respect to these SAEs will use chi -square or other appropriate 2 -sample or >2 -sample 
methods). Safety data will be reported by [CONTACT_21129] 4 treatment groups a s well as active 
chelation vs. placebo chelation and active OMVM vs. placebo OMVM.  The DSMB will 
review data partially masked by [CONTACT_2060] (such as X vs. Y and not active chelation 
vs. placebo chelation).   
 
Safety reports will be prepared for the DSMB ap proximately once every 3 months.  
Futility and efficacy monitoring will focus solely on the active chelation vs. placebo  
chelation  comparison.  The DSMB will review the active OMVM vs. placebo  OMVM  data 
for safety purposes only.  
 
For futility monitoring, TAC T2 will employ a modification of the inefficacy monitoring 
guideline of Freidlin, Korn, and Gray48 to stop the trial if the chelation strategy is not 
beneficial. We plan to use a conservative boundary, denoted as LIB0, along with a harm 
look at 25% of ex pected information. This approach will include 4 interim looks 
scheduled at roughly 25%, 40%, 60%, and 80%  of expected information . With the 
proposed design, a total of roughly [ADDRESS_33548] been observed. The harm look at 25% of expected 
information would suggest stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356] i f the data suggest s harm for the chelation 
strategy vs. the placebo chelati on with p-value s <0.05  for both the primary outcome and 
the all -cause mortality endpoint.  For the interim reviews at 40%, 60%, and 80%, the 
inefficacy guideline  suggest s stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34103] a 
hazard ratio > 1.0 compare d to placebo for both the primary outcome and the all -cause 
mortality endpoint.  This inefficacy monitoring approach will result in a trivial loss of 
power and requires no sample size adjustment.  
 
The method of Haybittle and Peto49,50 will be proposed a s the primary guide for 
interpreting interim efficacy analyses. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will 
correspond to the futility monitoring reviews  (i.e. at roughly 25%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of 
expected information) . The proposed efficacy monitorin g guideline requires large critical 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  36 values (Z=3, p≤0.001) for every assessment until the planned final analysis.  The TACT2 
investigators suggest that  both the primary outcome and the all -cause mortality 
outcome are  evaluated at the interim reviews with a focus on the comparison of active 
chelation vs. placebo.   
 
The CCC PI, DCC PIs, CCC staff, clinical study Co -PIs, site investigators, NIH Program 
Staff and study participants will remain blinded until database lock.  Limited staff will be 
unblinded to handle  randomization codes, deliver  the interventions to sites , and prepare 
DSMB reports . The statistical staff responsible for p reparing DSMB reports will not 
directly interact with the clinical team that delivers care to the study participants or the 
CEC that determines clinical events.  
 9.[ADDRESS_33549] occurrence of all -cause mortality, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34104].  
9.5.2  Secondary Outcomes   
The three secondary outcomes of TACT2 are:  
  
 the overall rate of events due to all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34105]  
  
 the time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial 
infarction, or stroke  
 
 the time to all -cause mortality  
 
The TACT2 CEC will review all primary and secondary endpoints .  
9.[ADDRESS_33550] ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals. In addition to 
the statistical hypothesis testing, Kaplan -Meier51 survival estimates will be construc ted 
based on the time from randomization to the first primary event occurrence.  
 
The OMVM treatment effect from the Cox model will be estimated using the Cox model 
described above.  Given the results of TACT  and the focus on chelation therapy, the 
interpret ation of the OMVM treatment effect will be considered exploratory.  
Assessment of the proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated using visual 
analysis (of the survival and log  {-log (survival)} functions), as well as tools within the 
“proportionality  test” statement of Proc Phreg in SAS.  
 
Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The analyses for the time -to-event secondary endpoints will be similar to those outlined 
for the primary endpoint using the time from randomization through the first occurrence 
of any component of a specific secondary endpoint (or censoring) as the response 
variable, and assessing group differences using the Cox proportional hazards model. 
The effect of the chelation treatment strategy vs. placebo chelation on these time -to-
event second ary endpoints will be summarized using hazard ratios (with associated 
confidence intervals) computed from the Cox model. Kaplan -Meier curves will be 
constructed to display the cumulative event rates of the treatment groups.   
To test the individual treatmen t strategies against the placebo chelation – placebo 
OMVM group, we will add three indicator variables to the Cox proportional hazards 
model described above.  
 
Recurrent event analyses encompassing the overall event rate of endpoints for 
each patient .  
The components of this endpoint will include all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34105]. We 
plan to analyze this endpoint using two statistical techniques. The two approaches are: 
  
a) A generalization of the Cox model to handle recurrent events, developed by 
[CONTACT_34153] & Gill, with robust standard errors to account for heterogeneity.52,53 
b) A marginal modeling approach developed by [CONTACT_34154], Lin, and Weissfeld.[ADDRESS_33551] medical costs incurred during the study 
(index infusion through end of follow -up). To account for staggered entry and 
incomplete follow -up, costs will be adjusted using the approach of Bang and Tsiatis.[ADDRESS_33552] (such as $1000, $2000, or $5000) will be calculated. 
Differences in cost by [CONTACT_34155], looking for both consistency and plausibility. Follow -up costs will be 
presented both overall and by [CONTACT_17203] (e.g., in patient  readmission, out patient  
procedures, concomitant medi cations, non -acute institutional care). Cumulative costs 
over the study period between treatment groups will be compared. Descriptive 
comparisons of cost according to clinical variables defining subgroups of interest will 
also be performed.  
 
The analyses f or toxic metals in blood and urine in the TACT2 population will proceed in 
three phases. First, we will evaluate if the chelation regimen has the effect on metal 
internal dose that we have postulated. To do this, we will compare  body metal levels 
(lead in blood , pre-chelation urine lead and cadmium, and post -chelation urine lead and 
cadmium, in separate analyses) between active and placebo chelation  groups at 
baseline  and over the treatment phase of TACT2. Second, we will relate  those levels to 
changes in the primary clinical endpoint (a composite of death from any cause, 
recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929]) 
caused by [CONTACT_34156]. Finally, we will perf orm the exploratory 
analyses described below.  
 
Over the [ADDRESS_33553] to see in TACT2 (the way LDL -cholesterol level lowering 
“explains” the benefits of statin therapy) using three complementary analytic 
approaches: 1] prespecified subgr oup analyses ( patients  in the highest tertile of blood 
lead, urine cadmium , and post -chelation urine lead and cadmium at infusion 1,  will show 
significantly larger treatment benefits (chelation vs. placebo) than patients  with lower 
baseline  levels), 2] lan dmark analyses ( patients  in the chelation arm with lower metal 
levels after 40 infusions/1 year of chelation will show significantly larger clinical benefits 
than patients  with higher levels), and 3] we will apply causal inference modeling to 
evaluate whet her the pattern of metal changes (lead in blood and cadmium in urine) in 
the chelation arm over the treatment period of TACT2 statistically “explains” the 
variation in clinical outcomes responsible for the hypothesized superiority of the 
chelation strategy .  
 
We will also do exploratory analyses to examine the clinical implications of different 
patterns of metal removal over time on the benefits of chelation therapy (can metal 
levels be used as a biomarker to guide the number of chelation sessions needed to  
maximize clinical benefit from this therapy?) and to examine the effects of the oral 
multivitamin/mineral treatment regimen versus placebo vitamins on metal levels and on 
the effectiveness of chelation in reducing those levels (does the TACT2 vitamin regi men 
augment the ability of the chelation regimen to remove metals, or might there be a 
different mechanism of action altogether?). The latter case could be inferred if there 
were clinical benefits of OMVM, but no changes in lead and cadmium levels.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, [ADDRESS_33554] of treatments will be performed using interaction terms within the Cox proportional 
hazards model. For binary variables, we will include the subgroup factor as a 
stratification variable within the Cox regression model. This model  structure will 
decrease the reliance on the proportional hazards assumption. Additionally, treatment 
effects within each categorical subgroup will be examined separately using Cox 
proportional hazards models. Event rates by [CONTACT_34157] 95% conf idence 
intervals will be reported for each subgroup. Forest plots will be generated displaying 
the estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each subgroup. For 
subgroups defined using continuous variables, the analysis based on the continuou s 
form will be considered primary but for display purposes these variables can also be 
categorized.  
 
We have pre -specified sex, minorities, age greater than 70, myocardial infarction 
location (anterior MI or not), type of diabetes (1 or 2), insulin treatment of diabetes, use 
of statin therapy at baseline  (for the OMVM analyses only), known peripheral artery 
disease at baseline  as key subgroups of interest. There are also pre -specified analyses 
by [CONTACT_34158] e. The examination of these pre -
specified subgroups will include formal tests of interaction within the Cox regression 
model.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
A validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for this study.  The 
majority of the study data will be transcribed by [CONTACT_34159] a secure manner to the DCC.  All data 
relating to th e study must be recorded in eCRFs developed by [CONTACT_34160].  Data must be entered into eCRFs in English. The investigator’s 
electronic signature, a compliant platform (21 CFR Part 11) is recorded in the database 
as verification th at all data are complete and accurate.   
10.[ADDRESS_33555] and report all access to data. The DCRI computer network is 
protected by a firewall. Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be identified by [CONTACT_34161], 
to ensure participant anonymity. No participant identifiers will be used in the 
presentation of data . Except when required by [CONTACT_2371], participants will not be identified by 
[CONTACT_2300], personal identification number (e.g. , social security number  in US and  Canada, 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  40 address, telephone number ) or any other direct personal identifier in study records. This 
information will be retained by [CONTACT_34162], quality of 
life and econ omic follow -up of the participants. Participants will be informed that the 
study physician and his/her study team will report the results of study -related tests to 
the Clinical and Data Coordinating Center and to the NIH. Participants will be informed 
that their records may be reviewed in order to meet federal, state or regional/local 
regulations. Reviewers may include the CCC/DCC monitors, IRBs/ECs, the NIH, other 
government regulators as dictated by [CONTACT_1769], or their delegates.  
 
Records of patients , sou rce documents, monitoring visit logs, eCRFs, inventory  of study 
product, regulatory documents, and other sponsor correspondence pertaining to the 
study must be kept in the appropriate study files at the site. Source documents include 
all recordings and obs ervations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and 
records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study. These 
records will be retained in a secure file for the period required by [CONTACT_34163].  Prior to transfer or destruction of these records, the DC C must be notified in 
writing and be given the opportunity to further store such records.  
 
10.3 Quality Assurance

that they  contain appropriate elements . 
 
 ensuring that the CRA monitors each site according to the approved 
comprehensive monitoring plan . 
 
 assuring during the site initiation visit that the site has adequate facilities/staff 
integral to the  successful operation of the study. The site initiation visit may also 
be utilized to conduct training  regarding regulatory compliance or individual 
protocol procedures.  
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  42  tracking recruitment of patients entered  updating relevant trial information on the 
trial web site . 
10.4 Medical Information Coding  
For medical information, th e following thesauri will be used:  
 
 Latest version of MedDRA for adverse events, and  
 World Health Organization Drug Dictionary for concomitant medications.  
11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
11.[ADDRESS_33556] (IRB) Review   
All TACT2 sites will submit the study protocol, informed consent form, and other study 
documents to their corresponding IRB for approval. Any amendments to the protocol, 
other than minor administrative changes, must be approved by [CONTACT_34165] d.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_33557] ample opportunity to review the consent form, ask questions, 
and make an informed decision on risks  and benefits.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality   
Overall policy:  Any data, specimens, forms, reports, video recordings, and other records 
that leave the site will be identified only by a participant identification number 
(Participant ID, PID) to maintain confidentiality. All records will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet. All computer entry and networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. 
Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as 
necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NCCIH, and the OHRP.  
 
Exceptions to the policy:  
1. The Study Pharmacy, following standard regulatory procedures, will deliver a -
specific prescription for each study infusion.  As such, they will know PHI for each 
patient.  The PHI for each  patient will be kept in a secured pharmacy computer, 
behind a firewall, and will be known to a minimum number of pharmacy 
personnel.  
2. The DCRI Call Center will make the initial  patient follow -up by [CONTACT_648].  As such, 
they will need to know PHI including patie nt name, next -of-kin, etc.  Again, this 
information will be kept secured in the DCRI Call Center.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, [ADDRESS_33558]. Recommendations 
for all scientific decisions will be made to the Steering Committee.  
 
Bioreposi tory Committee  
This committee will coordinate communication between Columbia University, the CDC 
and DCRI on aspects related to sample  collection, shipments and laboratory analysis 
(for metals); keep track of shipments (both specimen collection kits and samples) and 
samples collected, received, processed, stored and analyzed (for metals); troubleshoot 
any problems as they arise and repor t to the TACT2 operations committee.  
 
Operations  Committee   
This subcommittee of the Steering Committee will provide oversight for the day -to-day 
progress of the study.  
 
Publications, Presentations and Ancillary Studies (PPAS) Committee  
The objectives of this committee will be to facilitate timely dissemination of study 
findings, maintain high scientific standards for published material, prioritize the order of 
publication and presentations, and ensure equitable investigator participation and 
attribution o f authorship. The committee will ensure publications are well -aligned with 
the trial’s research agenda and are not redundant. The PPAS committee will review all 
proposals for data analysis, as well as research abstracts, presentations, and 
manuscripts befo re submission. The committee will also review proposals for ancillary 
studies.  The committee will also ensure that each publication that meets NIH Open 
Access criteria is deposited in PubMed Central.  
 
Committee for the Recruitment of Women and Minority Subjects  
Recruitment of women and minority subjects is a critically important part of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
clinical trial whose results can be generalized to the overall US population. The TACT2 
leadership has therefore constituted a committee of experts to assist  in enhancing 
recruitment of women and minority subjects. They will report to the Steering Committee 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  44 with suggestions as to how to increase the enrollment of women and minorities.  Some 
of these activities are covered earlier in this document.  
 
Data -Driven Trial Management Committee  
The objectives of this committee will be to:  
 review the established mapped key risk indicators and triggers (thresholds)  
 modify the risk levels where indicated  
 document actions taken and results  
 provide summary report of finding s by [CONTACT_1130], site, and study levels to study 
leadership.  
13. PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Publication of the results of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_34166], and the PPAS Committee. Both Committees will 
have NIH scientists as members.  Any abstract, manuscript or major presentation will be 
made available for review by [CONTACT_4289], in accordance with NIH policies,  prior to submission.  
Per NIH policies, a public data set that is not identifi able will become available when the 
study has been completed.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Protocol version [ADDRESS_506773] 2, 2020  
 Atovaquone for Treatment of COVID -19 
Ataq COVID -19 
 
Study Design: This is a  random ized, double -blind study of atovaquone therapy  in adult 
participants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19. Approximately  60 participants who meet all 
eligibility  criteria may be randomized in a 2:1 atovaquone /placebo  ratio into one of the  
following treatment groups:   
Treatment Group 1: continued standard of care therapy  together with an oral dos e of 
1500 mg  atovaquone twice daily (administered with a meal or snack) for up to 10 days  
Treatment Group 2: continued standard of care therapy  together with matching placebo  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Viral load (Log copy number/ml by [CONTACT_937] -PCR) from saliva 
collection  at Day 8 from trial entry, or at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (if discharged before Day 8).   
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s:  
 
1. Change in viral load (Log copy number/ml) from baseline to Day 8 (or to 
discharge if discharged before day 8). 
2. Viral load (log copy number/ml by [CONTACT_937]/PCR) from saliva  collection at Day 15 or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402164] 15.  
3. Days from baseline to decrease in viral load by ≥2 Log copy number /ml. 
4. Proportion with  viral clearance (undet ectable by [CONTACT_937] -PCR) by [CONTACT_402178][INVESTIGATOR_402165] 8 of trial.  
5. Proportion with viral clearance (undetectable by [CONTACT_937] -PCR) by [CONTACT_402178][INVESTIGATOR_402165] 15 of trial.  
6. Proportion with ≥2 Log copy number/ml  change by [CONTACT_2006] 8 or by [CONTACT_402179][INVESTIGATOR_402166] 8. 
7. Proportion with ≥2 Log copy number/ml change by [CONTACT_2006] 15 or by [CONTACT_402179][INVESTIGATOR_402167] 15.  
8. Days to viral clearance among those with  viral clearance (unde tectable by [CONTACT_937] -
PCR) on last day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402165] 8 if still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
9. Days to viral clearance among those with viral clearance (undetectable by [CONTACT_937] -
PCR) on the last day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402168] 15 if still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
10. Explora tory clinical endpoint: Time to clinical improvement of ≥[ADDRESS_506774]  
11. Exploratory endpoint: Change in routinely collected clinical biomarkers such as 
CRP, ferritin, D -Dimer, IL -[ADDRESS_506775] 2, 2020  
 For all analyses of viral load and clearance, results from salvia samples  will be used for 
primary  and secondary  analyse s. If salvia cannot be obtained (i. e due to mechanical 
ventilation), a nasopharyngeal swab can be used.  
 
Ordinal Clinical Scale  
The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given 
study day.  Obtain Day 8 Ordinal scale   
1. Death  
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO  
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non -invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices  
4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen  
5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen  
6. Discharged  
 
Safety Endpoint:  Between group difference in treatment -emergent adverse 
events  leading to study drug dose reduction or discontinuation.  
 
Statistical Methods:  
All analyses will be performed among randomized participants who received at least one 
dose of study drug  and has at least one post -baseline viral load measurement .  
 
1. Given the skewed distribution of the viral load measurement, viral load will be 
compared at Day [ADDRESS_506776].   
3. Days from baseline to decrease in viral load by 2 log copy number/ml will be 
determined using  Kaplan -Meier analysis,  and the treatment groups will be compared 
with the log -rank test. The median number of day s from baseline to the decrease in 
viral load will be compared via the Wilcoxon rank -sum test.  
4. Proportions with viral clearance ≥ 2 log copy number change/mL at  Day [ADDRESS_506777].   
5. Days to clinical improvement ≥[ADDRESS_506778].  
There is no methodological approach for handling missing data values that is universally 
accepted in all situations. However, we propose to use an iterative Markov chain Monte 
Carlo method that can be used when the pattern of missing data is monotone (i.e.  a 
 
STU2020 -0707, Jain, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V2, Mod_3, [ADDRESS_506779] 2, 2020  
 patient  attends all visits until a visit is missed and never returns) or non -monotone.  Last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) is generally considered as a conservative approach, 
but the MCMC simulation method we propose will reduce the risk of overesti mation of the 
precision of the treatment effect.   
Sample Size and Statistical Power : 
A total of 60 participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 2 groups (Approximately 40 
participants in atov aquone group and 20 in placebo group) This sample size would result 
in the following statistical power for the viral clearance endpoints  
1. For the endpoint of viral load (log copy number/ml) at  Day [ADDRESS_506780] day of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 1, assuming a mean difference between the groups of 1.6 log copy 
number/mL, with equal standard deviations of 2, the power will be 82%  
2. For the endpoints of differences between baseline and Day [ADDRESS_506781] day of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402169], assuming, a mean difference -in-difference of >2.5 with a 
common SD of 3, the power will be >80%  
3. For the endpoint of days from baseline to decrease i n virial load by ≥2 log copy 
number/ml, the power will be >90% assuming a difference of [ADDRESS_506782] deviation of 1 day.  
4. For the analyses of the proportions with viral clearance, and the proportion with ≥[ADDRESS_506783] > 80% power to detect a 40% 
absolute difference between groups and 62% power to detect a 30% difference 
between groups .   
5. Because the ordinal scale and biomarker comparisons are exploratory, no power 
calculations are provided  
Aggregate blinded viral load data will be reviewed during the study and if the magnitude 
and/or rate of viral clearance is lower  than estimated , or the standard deviation is higher, 
consideration will be given to increase the sample size accordingly . 
Interim Analysis:  
 The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet to evaluate data when 50% of 
enrolled patients have completed 10 days. The DSMB  will review number of deaths, 
number of those on ventilators, and grade 3 and 4 drug related toxicities.  
Background  
In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, 
Hubei,  China. Sequencing analysis from the patients ’ respi[INVESTIGATOR_402170] 
a novel  coronavirus (CoV), wh ich was named COVID -19. As of April [ADDRESS_506784] b een reported,  making COVID -19 and major health 
emergency.  On March  11, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the resulting 
disease named  COVID -[ADDRESS_506785] 2, 2020  
 widely distributing effective vaccines or  novel antiviral drugs is unlikely to occur during 
this season, which l eaves  healthcare systems vulnerable, and risks high mortality rates. 
Alternatively, drug repurposing  strategies can create viable path ways towards 
identification of potential  therapeutics with established safety profiles that can be used 
individually or in  combinations for targeting molecular regulators of replication or the 
survival of  SARS -CoV-2. While these strategies are unlikely to provide immunity or cure,  
they may identify therapeutics that can alter the clinical course of COVID -19 3-8. 
The betac oronavirus genome encodes structural proteins, including the glycosylated  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein that serves as a major inducer of host immune responses.  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_402171] 2 
(ACE2) (a homo log of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE)  which is a membrane bound 
carboxypeptidase). The cellular invasion process  appears to be mediated by [CONTACT_402180] S protein facilitated by [CONTACT_402181] -produced  serine protease TMPRSS2. In addition, 
the viral ge nome also encodes  nonstructural proteins including RNA -dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp), coronavirus  main protease (Mpro), and papain -like protease (PLpro)  
5,9,10.  
Therefore, targeting ACE2, TMPRSS211, RdRp, Mpro, and PLpro, as individual  targets, 
or in combination, is a viable strategy for repurposed drugs. To that end,  different drug 
repurposing efforts have been executed starting with data driven  framework coupled with 
in vitro assays . One study demonstrated  the potential of a poly -ADPribose  polymerase 1 
(PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in a Phase I clinical  trial, that may serve as a 
potential drug candidate to inhibit SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_506786]. CVL218  showed potential binding affinity of the N -
terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N)  protein of COVID -[ADDRESS_506787] to binding affinity and interactions.  Our structure -based 
approach for drug screening was focused on targeting  COVID -19 virus Mpro based on the 
elegant work that resulted in solving the crystal  structure of COVID -19 Mpro in complex 
with an inhibitory peptide N3 (PDB ID:6LU7). In particular, that inhibitory peptide binds 
the substrate -binding pocket of  COVID -[ADDRESS_506788]  COVID -19 virus  main  Mpro substrate -binding  pocket  focusing  on two potential  
sites (central  and terminal  sites)  to identify  potential  hits based  on their binding  energies,  
binding  modes,  interacting  amino  acids,  and therapeutic  indications.  In addition,  we 
screened  the top hits at both binding  sites for potential  covalent  binding  via nucleophilic  
thiol attack  of Cys 145. We also elucidate d the preliminary  pharmacophore  features  for 
the top candidates  using  the three  strategies  bound  to COVID -[ADDRESS_506789] 2, 2020  
  
The top hits that bound  to the central  site of the Mpro substrate -binding  pocket  include d 
anti-viral drugs  such  as darunavir,  nelfinavir  and saquinavir  (some  of which  are already  
being  tested  in COVID -19 patients, ) as well as the hypercholesterolemia  drug 
rosuvastatin  and the anti-malarial  drug atovaquone.  The top hits that bound  to the 
terminal  site of the Mpro substra te-binding  pocket  include  the anti-asthma  drug 
montelukast  and the anti-histamin e drug fexofenadine , among  others.  Finally,  the top 
candidates  predicted  to undergo  covalent  binding  were  atovaqoune,  mitoxantrone,  and 
metamizole.   
 
We performed  viral replica tion assays  on all top hits from our in silico  screen.  The only 4 
drugs  that inhibited  viral replication  out of the top hits using  the 3 docking  strategies  were  all 
predicted  to bind covalently  to Cys145.  These  drugs  are Atovaquone,  Ouabain,  Dronedarone,  
and Mebendazole.  We determined  the following  IC50s  in Vero  E6 cells:  Atovaquone  (1.5
M); 
Ouabain  (0.030  M); Mebendazole  (0.25 -1.2 M) and Dronedarone  (1.5 M– however  
dronedarone  antiviral  was likely  secondary  to cell toxicity).  Drondarone  had significant  cellular  
toxicity,  while  ouabain  is no longer  approved  in the US and mebendazole  in not marketed  in the 
US any longer.  Therefore,  the top hit from our screen  than can be immediately  repurposed  for 
treatment  of COVID -19 patients  is atovaquone .  
 
  
Atovaquone:  
Investigations into t he treatment for COVID -19 span different mechanism s, as no 
consensus has been reached on what is the main driver of pneumonia , respi[INVESTIGATOR_402172] . One approach is antiviral in which the investigational drug 
would clear viral infection leading to improvement in clinical outcome; an alternative 
approach is anti -inflammatory in which the investigational drug would reduce levels of 
inflammatory cytokines to improve clinical outcomes. Yet, oth er mechanisms are being 
targeted to treat systemic complications of COVID -[ADDRESS_506790] notably that 
both drugs prolong the QT interval with reported cases of Torsades de Pointes associated 
with each .   
In the present study, we chose to focus on the  antiviral approach.  We seek to evaluate 
atovaquone  to (1) determine antiviral activity (2) to explore  if viral reduction or clearance, 
if achieved, is associated with improvement in clinical outcome.  
Atovaquone is an oral solution used as treatment of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 
(PJP) , for those unable to r eceive or tolerate trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole , at a dose of 
 
STU2020 -0707, Jain, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V2, Mod_3, [ADDRESS_506791] PJP at 
a dose of 1500 mg daily. Other labeled indications include: toxoplasmosis treatment and 
babesiosis treatme nt, at doses up to 3000mg daily  in 2-4 divided doses . 
Mechanism of action and spectrum of activity :  Atovaquone is a competitive inhibitor of 
ubiquinol and specifically inhibits the mitochondrial electron transport chain at the bc1 
complex12. Atovoquone is broad -spectrum and is used to treat malaria with an IC [ADDRESS_506792] 
malaria in vitro  of 1-3.5nM. However,  it has high levels of plasma protein binding 
substantially decreasing levels of unbound atov aquone12. Atovaquone has also been 
found to inhibit arbovirus es such as Zika and chikungunya virus  replication by [CONTACT_402182]13. Additionally, atovaquone has been shown to reduce the 
interleukin -6/STAT3 signaling pathway in myeloma cells and in acute myeloid leukemia14. 
Drug concentration:   
Molecular weight: 366.837 g/mol  
MEPRON Suspension has been administered at dosage regimens of 500 mg once daily, 
750 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg once daily to deduce C max concentrations at 15.1 ± 6.1 
(40.89 µM), 15.3 ± 7.6  (41.7 µM), and 16.8 ± 6.4 µg/mL (45.79 µM), respectively.  
In the treatment of PJP, average (C avg/ss) plasma concentrations of 10 to <15 g/mL and 
15 to <20 g/mL yielded 79% to 95% success in treatment. The bioavailability of 
atovaquone is variable as determined in [ADDRESS_506793] of food  on GI absorption . 
In a study of 33 patients with either HIV or hematological maligna ncy requiring 
atovaquone, patients were dosed 750 mg twice a day and C min was obtained 12 hours 
after evening dose and C max 1-5 hours after morning dose. The median C min (IQR) was 
11.3 g/ml (6.2 -27.8) and median C max (IQR) was 13.4 g/mL (6.0 -28.3) and we re not 
different between HIV and non -HIV patients. Nineteen of 33 (58%) had C min <15g/mL 
which may impact clinical response for PJP.  
Metabolism:  Under normal conditions, there is no evidence that atovaquone is 
significantly metabolized in humans, or that  metabolism is required for drug elimination. 
It may be possible that certain enzymes could be induced and therefore lead to increased 
atovaquone biotransformation, but this has not been demonstrated 15. 
Elimination:  The pharmac okinetic half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV 
administration and ranges from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours across studies following 
administration of MEPRON Suspension. Atovaquone pharmacokinetics are characterized 
by [CONTACT_402183] -life of 50 –[ADDRESS_506794] 2, 2020  
 Distribution:  Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) and therefore 
the concentration of unbound atovaquone i n the vascular compartment will be 
significantly lower  than measured plasma concentrations17. In a study of atovaquone 
population pharmacokinetics, the volume of distribution of atovaquone was 7.98 L/kg, 
although individual values were markedly linked to bod y weight; the volume of distribution 
shows a linear increase with increased patient body weight18. This volume of distribution 
indicates that atovaquone is not confined to the intravascular space.  
We were unable to find literature describing the tissue concentration of atovaquo ne 
following systemic administration, however, several reports suggest that atovaquone is 
not confined to the intravascular space, despi[INVESTIGATOR_402173] a low drug clearance rate, which suggests that it likely accumulates in tissue12 
Another level of evidence in support of tissue accumulation of atovaquone is the effective 
concentration needed for its therapeutic effect. While the IC [ADDRESS_506795] 
falciparum malaria is in the low nanomolar  range, the IC 50 for atovaquone for  
pneumocystis  jirovecii pneumonia is from 0.1-3.0 ug/ml, which is equivalent to 8.178 
M.  
The IC50 for atovaquone against SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_506796] on SARS -CoV-2 is well within the  FDA approved dosing 
regimen.  
Drug inte raction:  Atovaquone exposure is markedly decreased when taken with rifampin .  
Tolerability:  Atovaquone has been found to be generally well tolerated.  Adverse events 
have been mild and include rash, fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and headache.  
Current studies in COVID -19: Currently , an independent single center, single arm open -
label trial is  underway examining atovaquone 750 mg bid for up to 10 days in combination 
with azithromycin 500mg X 1 followed by 250mg daily for up to 10  days for COVID -19. 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] However, this study is limited by [CONTACT_402184] a contemporary control group for  
comparison.  
 
Design of the ATaQ COVID -[ADDRESS_506797] 2, 2020

Final r eview of AE s and concomitant medication  
Vital signs  will be captured if still inpatient  and the ordinal scale will be assessed . 
Assessments for Early Discontinuation from Study  
If a patient  discontinues study dosing (for example, as a result of an AE , intolerance of 
investigational product,  or clinically significant  laboratory abnormality  felt to be at least 
possibly trial -related ), every attempt should be made to keep the patient  in the study and  
continue to perform the required study -related follow -up and procedures . If this is not 
possible or acceptable to the patient  or investigator, t he patient  may be discontinued from 
the trial, with phone call for vital status on trial Day 29. 
Drug Dosage Reduction:   
Atovaquone should be given with food to increase absorption and to possibly limit GI 
intolerance . Known adverse events including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If patient 
develops moderate to severe GI symptoms, a reduction in dose to 750 mg bid can be 
instituted per investigator discretion to enhance the likelihood for the patient  to complete 
therap y.  
Criteria for Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Study medication may be interrupted or discontinued in the following instances:  
 
• Intercurrent illness that would, in the judgment of the investigator, affect 
assessments of  clinical status to a significan t degree. Following resolution of 
intercurrent illness, the patient  may resume study dosing at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
• Unacceptable toxicity, or toxicity that, in the judgment of the investigator, 
compromises the  ability to continue study -speci fic procedures or is considered to 
not be in the patient ’s best  interest  
 
STU2020 -0707, Jain, FormA -ResearchProtocol -V2, Mod_3, [ADDRESS_506809] 2, 2020  
 • Patient  request to discontinue for any reason  
• Discontinuation of the study at the request of a regulatory agency or an institutional  
review board (IRB)  
• DSMB recommends termination of trial

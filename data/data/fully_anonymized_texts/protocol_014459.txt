2 Study design 
 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham-procedure-controlled study of ISIS 396443 administered intrathecally over 15 months to patients with later-onset SMA.  Approximately 117 subjects will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_807318] ’s age at screening: <6 years versus >[ADDRESS_807319] sham procedure, they will be replaced.  
ISIS 396443 will be administered using a loading regimen (dosing on Study Days 1, 29, and 
85) followed by a maintenance dosing 6 months thereafter (Day 274).  Subjects randomized to 
the sham -procedure control group will undergo a sham-procedure on Study Days 1, 29, 85, 
and 274.  
No adjustment of dose is permitted.  However, should a concurrent illness prevent the dosing 
procedure from being performed safely, each scheduled dose may be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] [ADDRESS_807320] (DSMB) (Section 6.6). In the protocol it was planned that an interim analysis may be conducted when all subjects will have completed the month [ADDRESS_807321] had the opportunity to attend the assessment at Month 6 (Section 5.1).   In the event of a decision by [CONTACT_608798] a sham-controlled study is no longer deemed ethical based on an updated risk benefit assessment of ISIS 396443 from the planned interim analysis, all subjects will be invited for the end- of-double-blind-period (EODBP) study visit, during which all Day [ADDRESS_807322] sham procedure at which their eligibility for the study will be examined.   
 
2.2 Treatment  
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be admitted to the study center on Day 1, 
undergo pre-dose evaluations, and then receive either an LP injection of ISIS 396443 or 
undergo a sham procedure.   
Both the sham procedure and ISIS 396443 will be administered by [CONTACT_608799] (this will not be any of the key study s ite 
personnel such as the Principal Investigator, study coordinator, or outcomes assessors) in a 
dedicated room and the key study personnel and the parents will not be present during the 
procedure to ensure blinding of treatment assignment.   
ISIS 396443 w ill be administered as an intrathecal slow bolus (1 -3 minute) LP injection.  ISIS 
396443 will be administered using a ‘spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]’ needle and 5 mL syringe.  A 22G to 
25G spi[INVESTIGATOR_608792].  The target site for needle insertion is the 
L3/L4 space, but may be [ADDRESS_807323] ug are 
kept, thus simulating the time period of a study drug administration procedure.  
Study drug and sham kits will be packaged in a blinded fashion.  Blinded kits for sham 
procedure contain artificial CSF (5.0 mL solution per 6 mL vial) that will not be injected but 
will be used to simulate CSF samples for that subject.   
Subjects will return to the study center on Days 29, 85, and 274 for follow-up evaluations and 
subsequent injections/sham procedures. Following the injection/sham procedure on Day 1, 
subjects will remain at the study center for at least [ADDRESS_807324]- procedure for safety 
monitoring. Following the injection/sham procedure on Days 29, 85, and 274, subjects will 
remain at the study center for at least [ADDRESS_807325]- procedure for safety monito ring. Safety 
monitoring visits will occur Study Days 30, 86, 92, 169, and 275 (through the last 
injection/sham procedure).  In addition, the study center will monitor the subject’s condition 
through telephone c[INVESTIGATOR_2394]tact [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a monthly basis. 
ISIS [ADDRESS_807326] dose of ISIS 396443/undergo the first sham procedure will be replaced. Results from these subjects 
will be reported in the CSR as occurring before the start of treatment and will not be included 
in the f ormal analyses.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_807327] visit (either in -person visit or telephone contact).    
2.[ADDRESS_807328] sham procedure is performed. Subjects are to return to the clinic 4 weeks later on Day 
29 (±1 day), 12 weeks later on Day 85 ( ±2 days), 13 weeks later on Day 92 (±1 day), 24 
weeks later on Day 169 ( ±2 days), 39 weeks later on Day 274 ( ±7 days), 12 months later on 
Day 365 ( ±7 days), and 15 months later on Day 456 ( ±7 days) for final follow -up.

16 3 General considerations  
 
In this Statistical Analysis Plan, the terms “control” and “control group” refer to the set of 
subjects who were randomized to undergo the sham procedure, and the terms “treatment” and 
“dosed” are used interchangeably to describe those subjects in the ISIS [ADDRESS_807331] one intrathecal injection of ISIS 396443.  
In order to distinguish nominal visit names from duration defined in terms of days, visit 
names will be referred as “Day 29”, “Day 85,” etc., and “29 days” or “85 days,” etc. will be 
used to define time intervals.  In the protocol definitions of the efficacy endpoints, and 
description of the interim analysis, “Month  6” is used to refer to “Day 169” and “Month 15” 
is used to refer to “Day 456” and this convention will be followed in this SAP. 
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) Set and the Per -protocol Set (PPS) will be used for the efficacy 
analyses.  The ITT Set is defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of study drug/sham procedure.  Subjects will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized.  This will be the primary population for the analysis of efficacy endpoints.   
An Interim Efficacy Set will be defined for presentation of the WHO motor milestone 
endpoints in the event an interim analysis is performed.   The Interim Efficacy Set will be 
defined as the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have the opportunity to be assessed at the 
Month [ADDRESS_807332] 463 days (456 plus 7 day window) between date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut -off date for the interim analysis (i.e., 
dosed on or before May 27, 2015). However, a subject who has died or withdrawn will be included provided that there is a time difference of at least 449 days ( 456 minu s 7 day 
window) between the date of first dose and the targeted clinical cut-off date of Aug 31, 2016 for the interim analysis (i.e., dosed on or before June 10, 2015). 
In the event of the study being stopped early, an Efficacy Set will be similarly define d for the  
analysis of motor milestones.   If, however, the study continues to completion as planned, the 
ITT Set will be used for the final analysis of motor milestones.  
The PPS will include the subset of the ITT who complete at least the initial 3 doses o f study 
drug/sham procedures, have baseline and Day [ADDRESS_807333] efficacy assessments. Significant protocol deviations will be determined prior to database lock bu t will include 
subjects who had onset of signs and symptoms consistent with SMA at less than or equal to 6 months of age, who cannot sit independently, whose HFMSE is <10 or >54 at screening, who had respi[INVESTIGATOR_608793] (defined as medical necessity for invasive or non-invasive ventilation for >6 hours during a 24-hour period), and subjects who took any medicines (such as valproate, riluzole, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, hydroxyurea, salbutamol, olesoxime) during the study for the tre atment of SMA, shown to modulate SMN 
gene expression or SMA disease progression in humans or preclinical models. The Safety Set, 
comprised of all subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug 
or underwent one sham procedure, will be used for the analysis of safety data. Subjects 
ISIS [ADDRESS_807334] -dose/post-sham procedure pharmacokinetic sample.  
Analysis of immunogenicity data will also be based upon this population. 
A listing denoting inclusion/exclusion of pa tients in all the analysis populations will be 
provided.  
The individual sites in this multicenter study will be pooled for the purpose of statistical 
analysis.   
Summary statistics will be presented throughout.  For continuous endpoints, the summary 
statistics will generally include number of subjects with data, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum. For categorical endpoints, the summary statistics will generally include:  number of subjects randomized and/or dosed, number of subjects with 
data, and the percentage of those with data in each category.  Frequency distributions will be 
presented as appropriate.   
The statistical software, SAS
® version 9.[ADDRESS_807335] accountability  
The number of subjects who were screened, who were randomized, who were dosed, and who completed treatment, along with reasons for discontinuing treatment and withdrawing from 
the study, will be presented by [CONTACT_6654].  I n certain cases, CRF text 
detailing the reasons for discontinuation and/or withdrawal may suggest additional 
clarification of the reason provided on the CRF.  Therefore, additional information for subject 
accounting may be presented, utilizing reasons for discontinuing treatment and/or 
withdrawing from the study reclassified based on the detailed CRF text, prior to database lock.  Listings of those subjects who discontinued treatment and/or withdrew from the study 
and the reasons for discontinuation/withdra wal will be presented.   
4.2 Demographic and baseline disease characteristics  
Baseline data (demography, medical history, SMA history, baseline disease characteristics, 
baseline quality of life) will be summarized.   
Demography includes age, sex, ethnicity and r ace.  Medical history will be coded in MedDRA 
and the number and percentage of subjects with each history by [CONTACT_608800], including the presence of scoliosis and presence of contractures.  SMA history includes age of symptom onset, time from disease onset to enrollment, age at SMA diagnosis, time from 
diagnosis to enrollment, number of copi[INVESTIGATOR_102005]2 gene, highest motor function 
achieved, current motor function, wheelchair use, and amount of physical therapy.   
ISIS [ADDRESS_807336].  These assessments 
are further described in the next paragraph and Section 5. 
Weight for age and height for age will be summarized using the WHO child growth standards 
(WHO Child Growth Standards, 2006) for subjects aged up to 5 years and similarly the WHO 
growth reference data (WHO, 2007) for older subjects.   These standards comprise percentiles 
for weight and height for age by [CONTACT_608801] a website (www.who.int) in txt files. 
Subjects will be cross referenced with these files, given the age and sex of the subject to determine below which percentile they lie for each parameter.   The frequency and percentage 
will then be summarized for each of weight for age and height for age in the following 
categories:   ≤ 1
st, ≤ 3rd, ≤5th, ≤15th, ≤25th, ≤50th and > 50th percentile.   The standards do not 
provide weight for age percentiles for subjects aged > [ADDRESS_807337] of the pubertal growth spurt. Therefore, subjects aged > [ADDRESS_807338] is known to be followed on study calculated as follows:  
 
Overall time on study =  
                     (Last date on study) – (Date of first dose or first sham procedure) + 1.   
The last date on study is defined as the latest visit or telephone contact [CONTACT_608802] a given subject.  
Time on study will be categorized into the following inter vals: 0 to <=90, 91 to <= 180, 181 
to <=270, 271 to <=360, 361 to <= 450, >[ADDRESS_807339] day of follow -up.  Essentially, 
exposure is equivalent to time on study.

19 4.4 Concomitant therapy  
Throughout the study concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary for treatment 
of adverse events or to provide adequate supportive care may be prescribed.  A concomitant 
medication is any non-protocol specified drug or substance including over-the-counter 
medications, herbal medications and vitamin supplements.  Subjects are prohibited from 
receiving other experimental agents during the study including marketed agents at 
experimental doses that are being used for the treatment of SMA (e.g., oral 
albuterol/salbutamol, riluzole, carnitine, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, valproate, hydroxyurea).   All concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health 
Organization drug dictionary (WHODrug).   
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy) or diagnostic 
assessment (e.g., X -ray) performed between screening and last visit.  All ancillary proc edures 
will be coded using MedDRA.   
For the purposes of analysis, a concomitant therapy (including medication or ancillary 
procedure) is defined as any therapy that was taken on or after the first injection of ISIS [ADDRESS_807340] sham procedure.  This includes therapi[INVESTIGATOR_608794]/sham procedure if their use continued on or after the date of the first 
injection/first sham procedure.  In order to define concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_608795], the fol lowing additional criteria will be used:  
• if both the start and stop dates of a particular therapy were missing, that therapy is 
considered concomitant;  
• if the start date of a therapy was missing and the stop date of that therapy fell on or 
after the date of dosing, that therapy is considered concomitant; 
• if the start date of a therapy was prior to the date of dosing and the stop date of that therapy was missing and the therapy was listed as continuing, that therapy is 
considered concomitant;  
• if the start date of a therapy was prior to the date of dosing and the stop date of that 
therapy was missing and the therapy was listed as not continuing, that therapy is 
considered concomitant; or 
• if the start/stop date of a therapy is partial then where it is not possible to rule out that 
it was not taken concomitantly it will be considered concomitant. 
 
Denote the end date of medication as CMENDT and the study treatment/sham procedure start date as TRTSTDT. The medication is classified concomitant provided any of the following is NOT true: 
• CMENDT is complete and CMENDT is less than TRTSTDT.  
• Day of CMENDT missing and year/month of CMENDT is strictly before year-month of 
TRTSTDT.  
• Month of CMENDT is missing and year of CMENDT is strictly before year of 
TRTSTDT.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_807341] completes the 15 -month 
assessment or earlier if the study  is terminated on the grounds that conducting a sham-
controlled study is no longer deemed ethical based on the assessment of risk-benefit of ISIS 396443.    At the interim analysis and final analysis, the same analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used in analyzing the change from baseline in HFMSE score to month 15. At the 
interim analysis, the month  15 endpoint values will not be available for some patients, so a 
multiple imputation method will be used to estimate them ( Section 5.3).  This method will 
also be used in the final analysis for the primary endpoint     The interim analysis results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_10981] D ata Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) and an Unblinded Senior Management Team from the Sponsor. Recommendation will be made o n whether it is appropriate for the trial to continue according 
to the current protocol or whether the protocol needs to be modified. During the interim analysis, subjects will continue in the study.  In the protocol it had been planned to conduct the inte rim efficacy analysis with an alpha of 
0.02, however in finalizing this statistical analysis plan it was decided to conduct the interim analysis at a significance level of 0.025.  If the study is not stopped at the interim analysis, the 
final analysis (test and confidence interval estimate procedures) will be conducted at a significance level determined by [CONTACT_608803].   
 Let T
[ADDRESS_807342] estimated based on the resampling approach (Westfall and Young 1993): 
• Among the 126 subjects enrolled in the study, randomly assign 84 subjects to the ISIS 
396443 group and 42 subjects to the sham control group. 
•  Apply the re- randomized treatment assignment to the interim data and obtain the 
standardized test statistics T 1.  
• Apply the re-randomized treatment assignment to the final data and obtain the 
standardized tes t statistics T 2. 
Repeat the above procedure N times (N=[ZIP_CODE]) and obtain N pairs of test statistics T [ADDRESS_807343] corresponding to an alpha of 0.025. 
Once the estimated correlation ρ is available, the cut-off point c 2 for the final analysis is 
obtained by [CONTACT_10562](|T 1| ≥ c 1 or |T 2| ≥ c 2) =0.05, where  (T 1, T2) 
follow a bivariate normal distribution with mean vector (0, 0), standard deviations of [ADDRESS_807344] been rank prioritized:  
• the proportion of subjects who achieve a 3- point or greater increase from  baseline 
HFMSE score at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve any new motor milestone at 15 months 
• the number of motor milestones achieved per subject at 15 months 
• the change from baseline in Upper Limb Module Test at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve standing alone at 15 months 
• the proportion of subjects who achieve walking with assistance at 15 months. 
 In order to control the Type I error rate at 0.05 across interim and final analyses for the testing of primary and secondary ef ficacy endpoints, a stage wise hierarchical strategy utilizing 
independent alpha spending functions for primary and secondary endpoints (Glimm et al. 2010) will be applied. In the framework of the stage wise hierarchical testing, since the secondary endpoi nts will not be tested at the interim (i.e., no alpha spending), at the final 
analysis alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_807345] recent dosing/sham procedure administered. After completing the EODBP visit,
 subjects w ill be considered study 
completers and will be allowed to enroll into the OLE  study.  Under this scenario, since 
patient participation and monitoring continue until the study is stopped, the final analysis that incorporates the accrued data will be conduct ed. At the final analysis, the primary efficacy 
endpoint will not be tested again since significance has already been achieved at the interim.  The secondary endpoints will be tested at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_807346] be considered thoroughly as part of the decision to modify or stop the study. A recommendation to modify or stop the study will, therefore, not be based solely on statistical grounds.  
 
5.3 Multiple Imputation of missing data  
 In the protocol it was stated that the multiple imputation procedure would be used to impute missing values for all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  However in f inalizing this 
statistical analysis plan it was decided that to handle the missing data in the WHO motor milestones, the multiple imputation  procedure won’t be used because historical data showed 
that it’s very rare for non- ambulatory SMA patients to achie ve certain milestones (such as 
walking alone).  Therefore, an imputation approach based upon multiple imputation would face challenges due to low or zero numbers of subjects in the sham arm achieving a response.   
The imputation rules and analyses for motor milestones are detailed in Section 5.6.2.      
Multiple imputation for HFMSE , upper limb module test endpoint, PedsQL and ACEND 
 
Since month 15 HFMSE score values will not be available for many of the patients at the 
interim analysis, missing data will b e handled using the multiple imputation (MI) method 
(Schafer 1997; Schafer 1999).  The same method for imputation of missing values will be 
used at the final analysis.  
 The imputations will be performed on total scores  for baseline and post- baseline visits . The 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used under the multivariate normality assumption to impute the missing score by [CONTACT_39815] p.  The treatment variable will be 
coded so that the ISIS [ADDRESS_807347] identifier (USUBJID).   The variable list for imputations will include the baseline total 
score, age at consent, as well as all available post -baseline total scores. A set of 100 complete 
imputed data sets will be generated and the relative efficiency (RE) parameter will be checked.  The RE is a very common parameter used in MI to determine the acceptability of the imputed results.  Regarding the number of imputations, since the sample size in this study is relatively small and proportion of missing information is large, it will be important to run a large number of imputations to get an RE that is close to 98% or higher.   
 For PedsQL and ACEND the imputation will be performed independently on each dimension or summary score (constructed using all, or a subset of dimensions) separately, rather than at the item level.  
 The following pseudo SAS code and seeds will be used to perform the multiple imputation.

Multiple imputation analysis methods 
 For the HFMSE, PedsQL, ACEND, upper limb module the imputations will be performed on the ITT population.  In any sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation such as repeating the main analysis in the PPS the subset of subjects in the PPS will be selected from the 
multiple imputed datasets obtained from the ITT population. If the MI procedure imputes any

27 values outside the expected range for the scale e.g. from 0 to 66 for HFMS-E then va lues 
below 0 will be set to 0 and values above 66 will be set to be 66.   
 For each of the 100 imputed datasets, the endpoint will be compared between treatment groups using an ANCOVA model for continuous endpoints or logistic regression for binary endpoints as described in the main analysis for each endpoint.  The estimates from the 100 fitted models will be combined to provide an overall estimate with corresponding confidence intervals and p-value [Little et al, 2002].  For the continuous endpoints, the difference between treatments and the corresponding CI will be presented.  In addition, for each subject the median change from baseline to each visit will be calculated across the multiple datasets and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  For the analyses using  logistic regression the odds ratio and corresponding CI will be presented.  In 
addition, the estimates of the binomial proportions in each treatment arm and the differences between treatments will be presented (Ratitch, 2013).  
 If, due to a small sample s ize or other unforeseen scenario, the multiple imputation model 
does not converge or encounters computational difficulties, then the number of iterations will be increased.  If the model still fails then a Mixed Effects Model with Repeated Measures will 
be used as the primary analysis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].    In the presentation of results from multiply imputed data, the number of subjects with missing data and the degree to which it is missing will be summarized.

the analytical methods for the final ( Section 5.5.1) and interi m analyses ( Section 5.5.2) are 
described.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
28 5.5.1  Final analysis of primary endpoint 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Main analysis  
The main analysis is to compare the change from baseline HFMSE score at 15 months 
between the two treatment groups based on the ITT Set.  The data will be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a factor and age at screening and baseline HFMSE score as covariates.  The null hypothesis is that ISIS [ADDRESS_807351]- baseline HFMSE  data will be handled using the multiple imputation 
method. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity analyses  
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed for the final analysis of the primary endpoint.   
In the first, the main analysis  will be repeated using the dataset from multiple imputation of 
the missing data in the ITT Set, to compare treatment groups using the PPS.   
In the second, the analysis will be performed using a Mixed Effects Model with Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance matrix, where the treatment group, time 
(as a categorical variable), treatment by [CONTACT_6491], and patient age at screening will be 
included in the model as fixed effects; patient will be a random effect; baseline HFMSE and baseli ne by [CONTACT_608805] a covariate. No imputation for missing visit 
data will be performed and the analysis will be performed on the ITT Set. 
In the third sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non-
missing values at 15 months will be analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as for the 
main analysis, in essence an analysis of ‘completers’.  
In the fourth sensitivity analysis the missing Month 15 values will be impute d by ‘last 
observation carried forward’.  This will be performed on the ITT set and data will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_608806].  
In the fifth sensitivity analysis the main analysis using multiple imputation will be repeated 
but for subjects who have a missing [ADDRESS_807352] observed value or the baseline value w ill be imputed.   
The reasons for treatment termination are captured in the CRF in several  categories as: ‘Investigator judgment’, ‘Voluntary withdrawal’, ‘Pregnancy’, ’Ineligibility’, ’Protocol 
deviation’, ‘Adverse Event’ or ‘Other’, and a free text field captures further detail.  Therefore, a blinded medical review will be conducted, prior to unblinding to adjudicate if any are due to 
treatment failure.  This list will then be used in determining a subject’s response.  
From each imputation method, the data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_608807] p as the factor and subject age at screening and baseline value as covariates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Exploratory analyses  
In order to further explore the change in HFMSE score during the study and the difference between treatment groups the change from baseline to each visit will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model and multiple imputation as described for the main analysis.  A plot of mean 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
29 change from baseline (based on the estimates from the ANCOVA model)  over time will be 
provided by [CONTACT_1570].  
The total HFMSE score and  change from baseline to each visit will be presented using 
observed values. Individual items of the HFMSE and changes from baseline to each visit will 
be investigated to determine the pattern of shifts. 
Graphical representations to show each individuals response and Forest plots to summarize 
the primary endpoint and corresponding sensitivity analyses may be presented. 
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS. 
5.5.2  Interim analysis of primary endpoint 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Main analysis  
An interim analysis may take place as described in Section 5.1.  At the interim analysis,  the 
primary endpoint will be analyzed using t he same ANCOVA model as planned for the final 
analysis.  Endpoint values will not be available for many of the subjects at the interim analysis 
and the approach to handling missing post- baseline HFMSE  data will also be the same as for 
the final analysis using the multiple imputation method (Section 5.3).   
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity analyses  
The sensitivity analyses planned for the final analysis of the primary endpoint will be repeated 
at the interim with the exception of the PPS analysis.  
The analysis of subjects with non-missing Month [ADDRESS_807353] at Month 15 across the 100 datasets from the multiply imputed data will be used in the imputation.   
The exploratory analyses outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be performed  at the interim on the 
ITT Set using the imputed dataset from the main analysis .

Main analysis 
The multiple imputation datasets produced for the analysis of the primary endpoint will be 
utilized.  If a subject terminates the study prior to the [ADDRESS_807355] in the ITT Set who has an increase from baseline HFMSE score of 3 or more points at Month 15 will be defined as a responder; 
otherwise, a subject will be considered a non-responder. 
Treatment groups will be compared using logistic regression adjusting for each subject’s age at screening and baseline HFSME score.   
Sensitivity analysis  
Four sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the main analysis described above will be per formed on the PPS.   
In the second, performed on the ITT Set without any imputation, any subject who has an 
increase from baseline in HFMSE score of [ADDRESS_807356] has missing Month 15 due to any other 
reason , he/she will not be included in the analysis.  
In the fourth sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non-missing values at [ADDRESS_807357] who has an increase from baseline 
in HFMSE of 3 or more points at Month 15 will be defined as a responder; otherwise, he/she 
will be  considered a non-responder.

5.6.2  Proportion of subjects who achieve any new motor milestones at 15 months  
 
The WHO motor milestones are a set of six milestones in motor development, all of which would be expected to be attained by [CONTACT_654] 24 months in healthy children. The individual milestones are:  
 
• Sitting without support 
• Standing with assistance  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
33 • Hands and knees crawling 
• Walking with assistance  
• Standing alone 
• Walking alone 
 
Per the study inclusion criterion number 5, subjects would be expected to all have achieved 
and maintained at baseline the milestone ‘Sitting without support’ but none would have 
achieved the milestone of ‘Walking alone’.  The motor milestones are assessed at seven stud y 
visits using the WHO motor milestone criteria [WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group 2006]. As part of the assessment, the examiner records an overall rating of the subject’s emotional state and then for each milestone one of the following four cl assifications:  
 
• No (inability) – Child tried but failed to perform the milestone    
• No (refusal) – Child refused to perform despi[INVESTIGATOR_608796] 
• Yes – Child was able to perform the milestone  
• Unable to test – Could not be tested because of irritability, drowsiness or sickness 
 
Imputation for motor milestones  
 If for a milestone either ‘No (refusal)’ or ‘Unable to test’ are observed at a visit then the result will be first set to missing. Imputation will be performed for missing data considering each  
milestone separately using the following rules for scheduled visits.  For baseline, the closest non- missing milestone prior to or at first dose will be selected.  If the 
motor milestone is still missing then the missing value will be imputed as the median  of the 
non-missing values of the stratum to which the subject belongs to: Age at screening < 6 years 
or Age at screening >= [ADDRESS_807358] a non- missing value at this visit within the stratum: Age at 
screening < 6 years or Age at screening >= [ADDRESS_807359] prior to any analysis.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Final analysis  
Main analysis 
Treatment groups will be compared using logistic regression adjusting for each subject’s age 
at screening and baseline number of milestones.  Missing data will be handled as described in Section 5.6.2.  If a subject terminates the study prior to the 15-month assessment due treatment failure or death then  any imputed value will be ignored and the subject will be 
considered a non-responder. For the remaining subjects, the 15- month milestone data will be 
ISIS [ADDRESS_807360] one new milestone, he/she will be considered a responder. 
 Should the number of responders be less than 5 in either group, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead. If Fisher’s  exact test is used, the unconditional confidence interval for the 
difference in response rates will be provided (Santner and Snell 1980). 
Sensitivity analysis  
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the analysis described above will  
be performed on the PPS.  In the second, the analysis will be performed on the ITT Set and 
any subject who is missing all six milestone assessments at Month 15 will be considered a 
non-responder.  If 5 or fewer milestone assessments are missing at Month 15 then any missing 
individual milestones will be set to ‘Not (Inability)’ and for each subject the Month [ADDRESS_807361] who is missing all Month 15 milestone assessments for any other 
reason will be excluded from the analy sis; otherwise, the analytical method will be the same 
as that for the previous analysis.  
In the fourth  sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non-
missing values for all six milestones at [ADDRESS_807362]’s age at screening and baseline score.       
Exploratory analysis 
 Several additional analyses will be performed on the ITT Set (without any imputation) to further explore the consistency in achievement and maintenance of motor milestones during the course of the study.  In the first analysis, the proportion of subjects who achieve at least one new milestone compared to baseline and then maintain this milestone at successive visits will be assessed.  In order to be assessed as a responder, subjects would need to have completed the study and the following will also apply: 
• Milestones achieved at baseline are maintained across all study visits  
• The visit at which a subject first achieves at least one new milestone will be 
considered.  At least one of any new milestones achieved at this visit will then need to be maintained at subsequent visits 
•  At least two successive visits are required.  Thus, the first new milestone will 
need to be achieved at the latest by [CONTACT_43380] [ADDRESS_807363] is unable to demonstrate maintenance of the milestone(s) at 
future visits , he/she will be defined as a non- respon der.  
The proportion of subjects defined as responders under each definition will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_608808]’s age at screening and baseline number of 
milestones.   In addition, for each of these analyses, the number of vi sits at which a subject 
was judged to maintain the milestone as a responder will be summarized using counts and 
percentages. In this summary, non-responders will be presented as zero and 2, 3, 4 and 5 will 
be possible counts for responders.

seven point scale ranging from 0 - ‘No useful function’ to 6 – ‘Can abduct both arms simultaneously elbows in extension in a full circle until they touch above the head’. This first 
item will not contribute to the total score. The remaining 19 items are assessed on a three 
point scale using the following criteria: 0 - Unable to achieve independently; 1 - Modified 
method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another person; 2 - Normal 
– achieves goal without any assistance. For each item, a score will be collected on the left and 
right side. A derived total score will be calculated by [CONTACT_608810] [ADDRESS_807373] score will be used in calculating the total. If 3 or fewer items are still 
missing responses then it will be assumed that the score was 0.  If greater than 3 items are 
missing, then the total score will be set to be missing.

Main analysis 
The main analysis is to compare the change from baseline upper limb module test  total score 
at [ADDRESS_807374], the analysis described above will be performed on the PPS.  In the second, the analysis will be performed using a Mixed Effects 
Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance matrix, where the treatment group, time (as a categorical covariate), treatment by [CONTACT_6491], and patient age at screening will be included in the model as fixed effects; patient will be a random effect; 
baseline upper limb score and baseline upper limb score by [CONTACT_608811] a covariate. No imputation for missing visit data will be performed and the analysis will be performed on the ITT Set.  In the third, the main analysis will be repeated but for subjects 
who terminate the study prior to the 15-month assessment due to treatment failure or death , 
the worst of the last observed value or the baseline value will be imputed.    In the fourth 
sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set who have non- missing values at 
15 months will be analyzed.  For both of these treatment groups will be compared by [CONTACT_144406].

Main analysis 
The main analysis will be performed on the ITT Set and m issing  data will be imputed as 
described in Section 5.6.[ADDRESS_807375]’s age at screening and baseline ability to stand alone.  
Sensitivity analysis  
Four sensitivity analyses will be performed.  In the first, the analysis described above will be performed on the PPS.  In the second, performed on the ITT Set without any imputation, any 
subject who has no assessment of standing alone at Month 15 will be considered as a non-responder; otherwise the analytical method is the same as that for the main analysis.   
In the third sensitivity analysis, performed on the ITT Set, any subject w ho is missing the 
Month [ADDRESS_807376] who is missing the Month 15 assessment for any other reason will be 
excluded from the analysis ; otherwise the analytical method will be the same as that for the 
main analysis.  In the fourth sensitivity analysis, only the subset of subjects in the ITT Set 
who have non-missing values for standing alone at 15 months will be analyzed.

of the ITT Set . 
 
5.6.8  Exploratory analysis  
 
For each secondary endpoint in order to further explore the change over time, the change from 
baseline to each visit or the proportion responding in each group at each visit will be analyzed as described in the main analysis for the final analysis.  Summaries will be provided by 
[CONTACT_1570].   
The following displays may be presented by [CONTACT_608813]: 
• Thresholds of response in HFMSE, frequency and percentage 
• Change in total motor milestones  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
42 • Change in upper limb score   
Graphical representations to show each individuals response and Forest plots to summarize 
the primary endpoint and corresponding sensitivity analyses may also be presented.  
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS. 
 
5.7 Tertiary endpoints 
5.7.1  Change from baseline in CSF SMN protein concentration  
CSF SMN protein is collected pre-dose from subjects randomized to ISIS 396443 on Day 1 (the baseline assessment) and pre-dose on Days 29, 85 and 274.   
The change and percentage change from baseline CSF will be presented by [CONTACT_608814] 396443.  A plot of the mean and percentage change from baseline over 
time will be pr esented.  
Scatter plots of change from baseline in HFMSE versus change from baseline in CSF SMN 
protein and corresponding Pearson’ s correlation coefficient will be presented by [CONTACT_765].  
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS.   
5.7.2  Clinical  Global Im pression of Change (Investigator and Caregiver assessments) 
The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI) is assessed at five visits post first dose on Days 92, 169, 274, [ADDRESS_807382]’s caregiver 
each score how the subject has changed compared to ‘admission to the project’.  The 
assessment is scored on a 7 - point ordinal scale (1= Very much improved, 2 = “Much 
improved”, 3 =”Minimally improved”, 4= “No change”, 5= “Minimally worse”, 6= “Much worse”, 7 = “Very  much worse”).  
In order to investigate response on these scales, three definitions of responder will be defined:  
“Much improved”: Responder (<=2) versus Non-responder (>=3), “Any improvement”: 
Responder (<=3) versus Non-responder (>=4), “No worsening”: Responder (<=4) versus Non-responder (>=5).   
Main analysis 
The proportion of subjects who were responders  based on the “Much improved” definition of 
responder will be presented by [CONTACT_765]. 
Exploratory analyses 
The main analysis will be repeated for the two alternative responder definitions of ‘Any 
improvement’ and ‘No worsening’.   
Agreement between investigator and caregiver  
The agreement in assessment between the investigator and the caregiver will be examined.  
For each visit the proportion of assessments which agree (have the same assessed value) will 
be presented.  In addition, at each visit the weighted Kappa coefficient will be calculated.  No 
statistical significance testing will be performed but the coefficient will be interpreted in line with the ra nges suggested by [CONTACT_608815] (1977) for strength of agreement.

Exploring the relationship between CGI and HFMSE 
The change in HFMSE from baseline for CGI responders/non-responder defined using the 
‘Much improved’ definition will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], overall and by [CONTACT_608817].  A similar analysis will also be performed 
presenting the proportion of subjects who achieve at least 2, 3 and 4 points improvement in 
HFMSE for CGI responder/non-responder by [CONTACT_1570], overall and by [CONTACT_608818]. 
5.7.3  Change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  
Subjects will be evaluated using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) 
Measurement 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 Neuromuscular Module (Varni et al. 1999) at screening (the baseline assessment) and on Days 92, 169, 274, [ADDRESS_807383], and s ites are instructed to get both 
subjects and caregivers to complete the same age specific questionnaire as was collected at 
baseline irrespective of whether or not the subjects cross an age boundary at a subsequent 
visit.   
The PedsQL parent questionnaire is collected for children in the following age categories: 2 -
4, 5-7, 8-12 and 13-18 years.  Four dimensions are collected: Physical, Emotional, Social and 
School functioning and each item is scored on a 5 point ordinal scale (0= Never, 1 = Almost 
Never, 2= Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Almost Always).  The PedsQL patient questionnaire is collected for children in the following categories: 5 -7, 8-12 and 13-18.  Similar dimensions 
and 5-point ordinal scale are used as for the parents but for subjects aged 5 to 7 years a 3 -
point ordinal scale is collected, omitting the response levels of 1 and 3.   
In the neuromuscular module, one parent questionnaire is collected for all subjects 
irrespective of age with three dimensions: ‘About my child’s neuromuscular disease’, 
Communication’ and ‘Family resources’.  The same 5- point ordinal scale is collected for each 
question.  The patient neuromuscular disease questionnaire is collected for subjects in the 
following age categories: 5-7, 8-12, 13 -18. The questionnaire for subj ects aged 5 -7 years uses 
the 3 -point ordinal scale as above and has only one dimension - ‘About my Neuromuscular 
disease’.  The questionnaires for the remaining two age categories cover dimensions for ‘Communication’ and ‘Family resources’ and use the 5-point ordinal scale.   
In scoring a dimension the first step is to reverse and linearly transform to a 0- 100 scale (0 = 
100, 1 =75, 2=50, 3= 25, 4= 0), so a higher score is indicative of a better health related quality 
of life.  If greater than [ADDRESS_807384] assessments.  Similarly, the changes in the individual dimensions and health 
summary score will also be presented.   
The change and percentage change from baseline score (each total score and parent/subject evaluation separately) to each visit will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model wi th treatment 
group as a factor and age at screening and baseline score as covariates.  A statistical test for a 
treatment effect will be performed at Days 92, 169, 274, [ADDRESS_807385] baseline 
values.  The imputation will be performed separately for each dimension and total and 
psychosocial summary scores.   Due to the age specific nature of these questionnaires, subjects aged 2 -4 years would not be expected to complete the s elf-evaluation and if this is 
the case then imputations will not be performed and the subjects will be excluded from the analysis.  
A plot of mean change from baseline (each questionnaire and parent/subject separately) based 
on the estimates from the ANCOVA  model over time will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].   
Analyses will be conducted on the ITT Set and PPS. 
5.7.4  Change from baseline in Assessment of Caregiver Experience with Neuromuscular 
Disease  
Parents of subjects will complete the Assessment of Caregiver E xperience with 
Neuromuscular Disease (ACEND) questionnaire at screening and on Days [ADDRESS_807386] experienced by 
[CONTACT_608819],  including children with SMA 
(Matsumoto et al. 2011).  
The ACEND includes a total of seven domains assessing physical impact (including 
feeding/grooming/dressing, sitting/play, transfers, and mobility) and general caregiver impact 
(including time, emotion,  and finance) and each domain comprises several items.  The total 
score for a domain with n items, each item assessed on ordinal scale from 1 to z , is derived as 
follows: 100 multiplied by (Mean of the n items in the domain -1) divided by ( z-1).  This tota l 
score will be on a scale of [ADDRESS_807387] two items for the time domain and one item for the remaining domains 
need to be non- missing for a total to be calculated; else the total score will be set to be 
missing.  
The change and percentage change from baseline for each domain will be presented by [CONTACT_3232].  An ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the change and percentage 
change from baseline through to [ADDRESS_807388] shown that data of this 
type are typi[INVESTIGATOR_139701] -dispersed, i.e., the variation seen is greater than that predicted by [CONTACT_608820].  To account for over-dispersion in the annualized rate of events, the negative binomial distribution will be used.  Thus, on the basis of event rate, treatment groups will be compared using a negative binomial model adjusting for the stratification factor, age at 
screening.  An “offset” parameter, the logarithm of the time on study, will be included in the 
model.  If the data are underdispersed, or if the negative binomial regression model does not converge, a Poisson regression model with the same covariate will be used instead of the 
negative binomial regression model.  Dispersion will be evaluated from the Pearson chi-
squared statistic.    
Analyses will be performed on the ITT Set and PPS.  
5.8 Subgroup analyses  
 
The main analysis for the primary endpoint and each secondary endpoint will be presented for the following subgroups: 
• geographic region (North America, Europe and Asia- Pacific).   
• below and above the stratification factor used in the randomization (Age at 
screening < 6 years versus >=6 years)  
• Disease duration (time from SMA onset to Screening  in months ) by [CONTACT_608821]. 
If the number of subjects in a subgroup is too small (e.g., < 15% of total number of subjects in 
the ITT population), the analysis in that subgroup may not be performed.  In the event an interim analysis is performed then  subgroup analyses will be performed but the number of 
subjects with a Month 15 value within a  subgroup will be assessed and if <40% of subjects 
have a Month [ADDRESS_807389] research organization (Parexel) and reviewed by [CONTACT_608822] (DSMB) overseeing the study 
and an Unblinded Senior Management Team from the sponsor.  The DSMB, in accordance with its Charter, will make a recommendation to the study Sponsor on whether or not the study should continue according to the protocol or any modifications are needed based on the emerging benefit/risk profile.  
 After the review of the interim analysis results the Unblinded Senior Management Team will decide whether or not to proceed with regulatory submissions.  This decision will be based on totality of the data including the overall consistency of the data and the benefit/risk assessment.  If the Unblinded Senior Management Team decides to continue the study without regulatory submission, no additional personnel from the Sponsor will be unblinded to the interim data.  Should the Unblinded Senior Management Team decide to proceed with regulatory submissions, an internal filing team will be unblinded to the interim data.  The internal filing team will prepare and submit the marketing a pplications to the regulators.  
Members of both the Unblinded Senior Management Team and the internal filing team will not be involved with study management or operations after being unblinded to the interim data.  All internal individuals who had access to the unblinded interim data will no longer be involved in the conduct of the blinded study.

6 Safety data  
Analyses of safety data will include adverse events and serious adverse events ( Section 6.1), 
laboratory data ( Section 6.2), ECGs (Section 6.3), vita l signs ( Section 6.4), and neurological 
examinations ( Section 6.5).   Any worsening or new findings noted from the physical 
examinations will be reported as AEs.  
Analyses of safety data will be based on the Safety Set.  Baseline is defined as the last non -
missing result prior to the first dose of ISIS [ADDRESS_807390] sham procedure.  
6.1 Clinical adverse events  
All adverse events (AEs) will be analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence.  An 
adverse event will be regarded as treatment -emergent if it was present prior to receiving the 
first dose of ISIS [ADDRESS_807391] sham procedure but subsequently appeared.   
In the situation where change in severity (but no change in seriousness) occurs for an adverse 
event, study sites are instructed to enter an end date and start a new record for the adverse event. In the new record, the changed severity is to be recorded and the st art date will be set to 
be the end date of the previous record. Data linking those records are collected in the data base. Consider three scenarios:  
 
• The first AE record occurs prior to the first dose, the second AE record occurs on or 
after the first dose , and the severity increases: Only the second record will be counted 
as treatment -emergent.  
• The first AE record occurs prior to the first dose, the second AE record occurs on or after the first dose, and the severity decreases: Neither record will be counted as 
treatment -emergent.  
• Both records occur on or after the first dose: If the AE severity on the second record is 
worse than the severity on the first record, then count both records as treatment-
emergent.   But, if the severity improves, then only count the first record as treatment -
emergent.  
Of note, when counting the total number of treatment-emergent events, events linked through change in severity will still be counted as separate events.  
For events with missing start or stop dates, the following criteria will be used for the purpose of identifying treatment- emergent adverse events:  
• if both the start and stop dates for a particular event are missing, then the event is considered to have occurred on or after the first dose or sham procedure; 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
48 • if the start date for a particular event is missing and the stop date/time falls after the 
first dose or first sham procedure date/time, then the event is considered to have 
occurred on or after the first dose or sham procedure; 
• if the start time is missing and the start date is same as the first dosing or first sham 
procedure date, then the event is considered to have occurred on or after the first dose 
or sham procedure. 
• If it cannot be determined whether or not an event has occurred on or after dosing due 
to a miss ing or partial date, then the event will be assumed to have occurred on or after 
the first dose for the purpose of identifying treatment- emergent adverse events.  
Specifically, let AESTDT denote the start date of an adverse event and TRTSTDT be the start 
date of treatment/sham procedure. For the purpose of identifying treatment emergent adverse 
events, the following algorithm will be used for the imputation of missing or partial date:  
• If AESTDT is completely missing or the year is missing, then impute AESTDT  to 
TRTSTDT.  
• If, in AESTDT, year is present and month/day are missing and year is equal to the 
year portion of TRTSTDT, then impute the month/day portion of AESTDT to the 
month/day portion of TRTSTDT. 
• If, in AESTDT, year is present and month/day are missing and year is not equal to the 
year portion of TRTSTDT, then impute the month/day portion of AESTDT to January 
01. 
• Consider the situation in AESTDT where year and month are present with only day 
missing. If the year and month are the same as those for TRTSTDT, then impute day 
in AESTDT with day in TRTSTDT. Otherwise, impute the day in AESTDT with the first day of the month. 
It is important to emphasize that the imputed date will not be used for calculations such as onset and duration of an adverse event.  
Due to the long half-life of ISIS 396443, analyses of treatment- emergent adverse events will 
include all events reported during the study. Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  This coding system provides 
more than five levels to classify adverse events.  In general, adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_608823].   
The incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_259000].  A subject having the same adverse event more than once will be counted only 
once in the incidence for that adverse event.  The summary tables will include incidence estimates for overall system organ class as well as for preferred terms within each  system 
organ class.  Incidence will be presented by [CONTACT_608824].  The most common 
ISIS [ADDRESS_807392] 5% of subjects in either treatment group, 
will be presented.  In addition, adverse events that occurred with an incidence 5% or higher in 
the ISIS  396443 group than in the control group will be presented.  Upon examination of the 
actual data, different cut -offs may be used i f it is deemed more appropriate.   
6.1.1  Adverse events over time  
The incidence of AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_608825] 90- day time intervals.  For a given 
time interval, the number of subjects who were followed for adverse events during that time 
interval w ill be presented along with the incidence of adverse events during that time interval.  
Therefore, for a given System Organ Class (SOC) or preferred term (PT), subjects will be 
counted only once for a given time interval but may be counted once across time intervals.  
The incidence of AEs will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_608826] (loading phase: Day 1 to Day 
272, maintenance phase: Day 273 and beyond) using the same methodology as described above.  For classifying adverse events into different time intervals , the algorithm in Section 6.[ADDRESS_807393] the degree to which each adverse event is related to study drug (not related, unlikely or remotely related, possibly related, and related).  If a subject 
experiences the same adverse event multiple times, the event with the strongest relationship to 
study drug will be counted.  For each treatment group, the incidence within each category will be presented.  The incidence of drug- related  events (those categorized as possibly related or 
related) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].   
6.1.4  Serious adverse events  
The incidence of treatment- emergent serious adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490].  All serious adverse events will be listed including any that occurred prior to 
commencement of study treatment.  Similar tables will be generated for adverse events that 
led to discontinuation of study treatment and those that led to withdrawal from the study.  
6.1.5  Deaths  
All adverse events which led to death will be listed.  
6.1.6  Adverse events following dosing /sham procedure  
To examine the onset of any adverse events following dosing or the sham procedure the incidence of events that occur [ADDRESS_807394] 72 hours following dosing or sham procedure 
will be provided.   
AEs potentially related to LP occurring within 7 days of dosing, such as the PTs headache and 
back pain will be summarized.    For identifying adverse events following dosing or the sham procedure, the algorithm in Section 6.1 for the imputation of missing or partial start dates will be used. If time is missing and the event occurs on the same day as the day for dosing/sham procedure, the time for the dosing/sham procedure will be used as the imputed time.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_807395] of the formation of anti-ISIS 396443 antibodies on the safety of ISIS 
396443, the incidence of adverse events in those ‘persistently’ positive, ‘transiently’ positive, 
and antibody negative will be presented.  The definition of persistence is given in Section 8 .  
6.1.8  Adverse Events Related to SMA  
The analysis of disease related events in Section 5. 7.5 will present the overall incidence of 
events.  To further explore the nature of these events the following categories of event will be presented.   A blinded medical review prior to database lock will be conducted to ensure these 
proposed groupi[INVESTIGATOR_608797]. 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]: events that are coded into the SOC of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic, 
and mediastinal disorders, either as their primary SOC or their secondary SOC  
• Symptoms of gastric reflux: events identified by [CONTACT_588265] 
(SMQ) fo r gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammations  
• Athralgia and other issues related to joints: events identified by [CONTACT_608827].  The final set of terms will be refined by [CONTACT_608828]  
• Scoliosis: events identified by [CONTACT_608829]  
• Contractures:  events identified using the PTs: Extremity contractures, joint 
contracture, muscle contracture and tendinous contracture 
6.1.9  Presentations  
The following presentations will be shown:  
• an overall summary showing, for each treatment group, the number and percentage of 
subjects with an adverse event, a moderate or severe event, a severe event, a possibly

To avoid the potential for misleading int erpretation of analysis of adverse events, no statistical 
testing will be performed.   
6.2 Clinical laboratory data 
Blood is to be drawn and urine collected for laboratory analysis at screening, and on Day 1 
(pre-dose), 2, 29, 85, 169, 274 and 456.  The followi ng clinical laboratory parameters are to 
be assessed:   
• Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, WBC count with 
differential both as absolute values and as a percentage (neutrophils, eosinophils, 
basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes), and platelet count.   
• Blood chemistry: liver function (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT/SGPT, 
AST/SGOT,) kidney function and electrolytes (BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
chloride), total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, bicarbonate, glucose, cystatin 
C, and CPK.  
• Urinalysis: specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, RBC, 
WBC, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], bacteria, casts, and crystals.   
As described below, laboratory data will be examined using an analysis of “shifts”. However  
further analyses may be undertaken to more fully characterize potential laboratory safety 
signals, such as assessment of timing, recovery, reversibility, association with adverse events, 
etc.  
In the second approach, each subject’s laboratory values will be classified according to 
whether the test result is “low” (i.e., below the lower limit of normal [LLN]), “normal” 
(within the normal range), or “high” (i.e., above the upper limit of normal [ULN]).  If a 
subject is missing a baseline value but had a post- baseline value, then the baseline assessment 
is labeled as “unknown”.  Likewise, if a subject had a baseline value but had no post- baseline 
values, then the minimum and maximum are labeled as “unknown”.  Post- baseline laboratory 
results are defined as any  assessment taken after the first dose, including data collected from 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
52 local laboratories.  The shifts (relative to the normal range) from baseline to the minimum and 
maximum post- baseline values will be presented.  Should a treatment affect a laboratory 
parameter, that parameter could be affected at different times for different subjects.  
Therefore, these analyses present the most extreme values for each subject.  For many laboratory parameters, the effect could be in either direction, (i.e., an increase or a decrease), 
so both the maximum and minimum values have been analyzed.  From these, the shifts 
(relative to the normal range) from baseline to low and high will be calculated.  If a subject's value shifts, it can change from normal to either low or high, from low to normal or high, 
from high to normal or low, or from unknown to low, normal, or high.  For each parameter, 
the incidence of shift to low will be summarized using the minimum post- baseline values.  
Shift to low includes subjects with a normal, high, or unknown baseline value and at least one 
post- baseline value of the given test.  Similarly, the incidence of shift to high will be 
summarized using the maximum post-baseline values.  Shift to high includes subjects with a 
low, normal, or unknown baseline value and at least one post- baseline value.   All blood and 
urine samples will be used in the shift analyses.  
Blood and urine samples for laboratory analysis are to be processed at a central laboratory.  
For many parameters, the laboratory has addit ional ranges, e.g., a notification to the site by 
[CONTACT_608834]’s result is outside the normal range significantly enough to warrant notification, and/or a panic alert involving a telephone call made to the investigational site to notify them that the subject’s result is outside of the normal range with potentially critical implications for the subject (see the table below).  For shift tables of lab parameters, those additional categories will be combined with the conventional categories. S pecifically,  
• LT (Low – telefacsimile) and LP (Low panic) will be classified as L (Lower limit of 
normal) 
• HT (How – telefacsimile) and HP (How panic) will be classified as H (Upper limit of 
normal) 
For liver function tests, additional categories will be def ined to present the baseline and post-
baseline values as within the upper limit of normal,   >1-<[ADDRESS_807396], ≥3-<[ADDRESS_807397], ≥ 5-<[ADDRESS_807398], ≥ 10 - <[ADDRESS_807399], >=[ADDRESS_807400] for ALT/AST, >1 -<[ADDRESS_807401], ≥ [ADDRESS_807402] for total

6.3 ECGs  
ECGs are to be recorded  at screening, and on Days 2, 29, 92 and 456 and will be quantified 
prior to the final database lock at a central reading laboratory.  ECG qualitative results include 
an overall interpretation of ‘normal’, ‘abnormal but not clinically significant’ or ‘abnormal 
and clinically significant’.  ECG quantitative parameters include heart rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, uncorrected QT interval, and corrected QT interval.   
ECGs will be analyzed using two approaches.    
6.3.[ADDRESS_807405]- baseline corrected Q T 
interval greater than certain threshold values (e.g., >450 msec, >480 msec, and >500 msec) 
and the number and percentage of subjects with an increase from baseline in corrected QT 
interval in various categories (e.g., >30 msec and >60 msec).  These summaries will be 
performed on an overall basis, as well as separately for subjects whose baseline corrected Q T 
intervals a re normal ( ≤ 450 msec) and elevated (>450 msec).

dosing on dosing days (Days 1, 29, 85 and 274).  Additionally, assessments are made on Days 
92, 169, [ADDRESS_807407]-dosing 
(i.e., from pre-dosing to [ADDRESS_807408]-dosing, etc.) will be calculated.  Summaries of actual values and change from pre-dosing for each dosing day will be 
presented.   
6.4.2  Chronic effects  
To examine for possible chronic effects, the change from baseline (the pre-dosing value on 
Day 1) to the pre-dosing value on later dosing days and to Days 92, 169, 365 and 456 will be 
determined.  Summaries of actual values and change from baseline to each of these time 
points will be presented.  
6.5 Neurological examinations 
Neurological examinations include  assessment of mental status, level of consciousness, 
cranial nerves, reflexes, motor system, coordination/cerebellar function and sensation – 
temperature and vibration. These are to be assessed at screening, pre-dosing and at [ADDRESS_807409]-dosing on dosing days (Days 1, 29, 85 and 274) and on Day  92,169, 365 and 456.  
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
55 The result collected for the majority of the tests is ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’, however the 
assessment of sensations is reported as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ and the assessment of reflexes is 
captured on an ordinal scale.  For each test it is recorded if secondary to SMA.  
6.5.[ADDRESS_807410]-dosing (i.e., 
from pre -dosing to [ADDRESS_807411]-dosing) will be determined.   
For each test and post dosing time point, the number and proportion of subjects who moved from ‘Normal’ to ‘Abnormal’ will be presented, for sensations the number and proportion who move from ‘Present’ to ‘Absent’ will be presented.  For the assessment of reflexes 
decreases (from pre -dosing [ADDRESS_807412] doing 0, 2 to1 etc) will be presented.  Only changes not 
deemed secondary to SMA will be presented. 
6.5.2  Chronic effects  
To examine for possible chronic effects, changes from bas eline (the pre-dosing value on Day 
1) to the pre-dosing value on later dosing days and to Day 92, 169, 365 and 456 will be 
determined.  Summaries will be presented in a similar manner to that described for the acute 
effects.   
6.6 Interim safety analyses  
Safety  data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_608835].  
Safety data will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_8030].  The DSMB 
will be assembled to review safety, tolerability and efficacy data collected on ISI S 396443 
during this study and to review the results of the predetermined interim efficacy analysis (Section 5.1).  Based on its ongoing assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS 396443, the DSMB will provide recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37666].  
Details on the safety assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules and controlled 
access to unblinded data at the interim safety analyses are outlined in the DSMB Charter.

7.1 CSF Concentration Data 
CSF concentrations of ISIS 396443, along with the scheduled (nominal) and actual sampling 
times (i.e., time from IT dosing) will be listed (w hen applicable) for each patient, and day.  
Differences between scheduled and actual sampling days will also be listed for all patients.  
Percent differences between actual administered dose and nominal dose will also be listed.   
CSF concentrations below t he lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be indicated by 
“BLQ”.  For the purpose of calculating typi[INVESTIGATOR_10476] (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for CSF concentrations, 
all BLQ values will b e set to zero.  Mean CSF concentrations that are BLQ will be presented 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
56 as BLQ, and the SD and %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Summary statistics of the 
ISIS [ADDRESS_807414] and/or biostatistician, samples may be excluded from descriptive statistics 
if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sampling days or times, or large 
deviations between actual dose and nominal dose.  
Due to the limited CSF samples collected no CSF pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
calculated.   
7.2 Plasma Pharmacokinetics  
7.2.1  Plasma Concentration Data  
Plasma concentrations of ISIS 396443, along with the scheduled (nominal) and actual 
sampling times (i.e., time from IT dosing) will be listed  (when applicable) for each patient, 
treatment group, and day.  Percentage differences between scheduled and actual sampling times will also be listed for all patients.  Percentage differences between actual administered dose and nominal dose will also be listed.   
Plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be indicated by “BLQ”.  For the purpose of calculating typi[INVESTIGATOR_10476] (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for pla sma 
concentrations, all BLQ values will be set to zero.  Mean plasma concentrations that are BLQ will be presented as BLQ, and the SD and %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Summary statistics of the ISIS [ADDRESS_807415] and/or biostatistician, samples may be excluded from descriptive statistics if there are large deviations between scheduled and actual sampling times, or large deviations betwee n actual dose and nominal dose.  
ISIS 396443 plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles from Day 1 to Day 29, for each patient, as well as the mean (±SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles for the applicable treatment group, will be presented graphically on linear and 
semilogarithmic scales. ISIS 396443 plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles from 
Day 29 to Day 456, for each patient, as well as the mean (±SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles for the applicable treatment group, will be presented graphically on 
linear and semilogarithmic scales. Additionally, ISIS 396443 plasma concentration versus 
time (actual) profiles (Day 1) from 0 to 8 hours for all patients, as well as the mean (±SD) plasma concentration versus time (scheduled) profiles (0 to 8 hours) for the applicable 
treatment group will be presented graphically on linear and semilogarithmic scales. 
Additional plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles, for all patients and for individual patients may also be generated, including but not necessarily limited to Day 1, 0 to 
24 hours; Day 85, 0 to 4 hours; and comparisons between Day [ADDRESS_807416] data set using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.0 or higher (Pharsight 
Corporation, Mountain View, CA).  Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters in each patient 
(when applicable) will be determined.  For calculation of PK parameters, all BLQ values will 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
57 be set to zero.  The following plasma PK parameters will be calculated (when applicable) and 
based on actual sampling times:  
• Cmax:  the maximum observed drug concentration in plasma, and  
• Tmax:  the time at which C max occurs.  
The following PK parameters may be calculated using actual sampling times where 
appropriate data exists at the discretion of the pharmacokinetic scientist:  
• AUC 0-24h:  areas under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero time (pre -dose) 
to 24 hours after the IT administration will be calculated using the line ar trapezoidal 
rule,  
• AUC 0-8h:  areas under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero time (pre -dose) 
to 8 hours after the IT administration will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal 
rule, and  
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (if applicable) wi ll be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_1570], and day.   
Additional plasma pharmacokinetic parameters may be calculated (if applicable) at the 
discretion of the pharmacokineticist.  
Exposure-response relationships between selected pharmacodynamic (included but not 
limited to change in HFMSE) and pharmacokinetic measures (including but not limited to CSF concentrations, plasma AUC
0-8hr, Cmax, and plasma trough concentrations) may also be 
explored (including with and without stratification by [CONTACT_608836]), where appropriate. 
 8 Immunogenicity data  
Immunogenicity (IM) testing (anti-ISIS 396443 antibody positivity), using designated plasma 
samples collected from  each study subject, is planned to be conducted and reported.  
Immunogenicity plasma samples are to be collected pre-dosing on Days 1, 29, 85, and 274, and on Day [ADDRESS_807417].  An individual sample result will be 
designated ‘antibody positive’ based on both positive screening and confirmation assay resul ts 
(i.e., confirmed positive result), and otherwise will be deemed ‘antibody negative’.  A study 
subject will be given ‘antibody positive’ status if they have at least one confirmed positive 
sample result at any time during the treatment or post- treatment evaluation periods.  A study 
subject will be given ‘antibody negative’ status if all evaluated IM sample results are antibody 
negative and they have at least one evaluable IM result from Day [ADDRESS_807418] will be given 
‘antibody inconclusive’ status.   
The IM incidence and IM incidence rate at each evaluated study time point, and for the 
overall treatment and post-treatment evaluation period, will be determined and appropr iately 
ISIS 396443 -CS4  Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0  
 
 
58 summarized, by [CONTACT_3148], as the number of and percentage of evaluated subjects with 
antibody negative, antibody positive, and antibody inconclusive status.  In addition, in 
antibody positive study subjects, antibody titers of any antibody positive samples will be 
reported (listed) and also appropriately summarized across subjects and by [CONTACT_3148] (e.g., at each evaluated time point, or by [CONTACT_608837], etc.) at the discretion of the 
designated study pharmacokineticist and/or statistician.   
Antibody positivity in anti-ISIS 396443 antibody-positive subjects will also be designated 
(when possible) as being either ‘persistent’ or ‘transient’, but only for those subjects in which 
at least one confirmed antibody positive sample result is followed (>100 days later) by [CONTACT_608838] (which can be either a confirmed positive or negative result(s)).  Those study patients meeting the above criteria and with at least 2 confirmed 
positive IM results occurring greater than 100 days apart (~5 immunoglobulin half- lives) will 
be considered to have a ‘persistent’ antibody response.  All other subjects meeting the above 
criteria will be considered to have a ‘transient’ antibody response.  Those remaining anti- ISIS 
396443 antibody- positive subjects who do not meet the above criteria will not be classified as 
either ‘persistent’ or ‘transient’, and thus will be given the designation ‘ND’ (not determinable) for persistent/transient IM status.   
When and where warranted, PK (e.g., elevated plasma trough level) and selected safety and efficacy (e.g., HFMSE) results may be further summarized (stratified) by [CONTACT_608836] (antibody negative versus positive subjects) and treatment. In previous clinical trials, only 
minimal immunogenic ity samples have confirmed positive for anti-ISIS 396443 antibodies, 
therefore, if no, or minimal, patients are designated ‘antibody positive’ stratification by 
[CONTACT_608839].

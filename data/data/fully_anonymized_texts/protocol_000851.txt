I. Specific Aims  
 
Resuscitation strategies for the acutely injured patient in hemorrhagic shock have evolved with 
patients benefitting from receiving less crystalloid and early  red blood cell use with balanced 
ratios of plasma and platelets .1-[ADDRESS_1217884] hours f ollowing arrival at the trauma center, underscoring the importance of 
early interventions which provide benefit.1-3,5 Platelet transfusions are a vital component of 
Version 7: 12/17/[ADDRESS_1217885] care . Currently there is no high- level  clinical trial 
evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of urgent release cold stored platelet transfusion following injury. The aims of the Cold Stored Platelet early intervention  in hemorrhagic shock 
(CriSP -HS) pi[INVESTIGATOR_872006], efficacy and safety of urgent release cold 
stored platelets in patients in hemorrhagic shock.  
      
AIM#1 : Determine the feasibility, most appropriate study population and primary outcome that 
will lead to a large multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cold stored 
platelet early intervention in patients with injury and hemorrhagic shock.  
AIM#2 : Determine whether early cold stored platelet infusion compared to standard care results 
in improved clinical outcomes an d hemostatic function in injured patients with hemorrhagic 
shock.  
AIM# 3: Determine if early cold stored platelet hemostatic function is similar at [ADDRESS_1217886] care will result in a reduction in 3-hour mortality, 24- hour mortality, in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], 30 -day mortality, lower death from 
hemorrhage, reduced blood and blood component transfusion requirements in the initial 24 hours, a lower incidence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), a reduced time to 
hemostasis, a lower incidence of coagulopathy, improved hemostatic and platelet function and a 
similar rate of allergic/transfusion reactions and incidence of transfusion related acute lung injury 
in patients with injury and hemorrhagic shock.   
II. Background and Significance   
 
The acute management of the severely inju red patient with hemorrhage following trauma center 
arrival has evolved over the last decade.2,13   
 
Current treatment priorities include prevention of coagulopathy through minimization of  
crystalloid and early blood component resuscitation including plasma and platelets in equal ratios  
with packed red blood cells.3 These in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310] , termed damage control resuscitation, 
are widely used in both battlefield and civilian resuscitation following traumatic injury.2,3,1 4,15  
 
Initiation of the tenets of damage control resuscitation early, soon after arrival,  has the potential 
to reduce downstream complications attributable to hemorrhage by [CONTACT_872019] r to the time 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    7  
 of injury, prior to the development of coagulopathy; irreversible shock; and the ensuing 
inflammatory response.16-[ADDRESS_1217887] 3 hours. ( Figure 1 .) Platelet transfusion is 
associated with improved outcomes in the

Exclusion Criteria  
1. Wearing “NO CriSP ” opt–out bracelet  
2. Age > 90 or <  [ADDRESS_1217889] with > 5 minutes of CPR without return of vital signs  
6. Brain matter exposed or penetrating brain injury (GSW)  
7. Isolated drowning or hanging victims  
8. Isolated burns > estimated 20% total body surface area  
9. Objection to study voiced by [CONTACT_872021]. The volume of the intervention will be approximately 300ml and will be stored in a n FDA monitored 
approved refrigerator at 1- [ADDRESS_1217890] to avoid inadvertent clinical use.  
 
Study Intervention Arm : Patients randomized to  the study intervention arm will receive an early 
infusion of urgent release cold stored platelets (CSP) once the patient meets all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria. CSP infusion will be initiated  by [CONTACT_6098] , under the direction of the 
study team,  in the Emergency Department or during transport to the operating room (OR) or 
interventional radiology (IR) suite. For those patients who initia lly lack IV  access, CSP infusion 
will occur once IV access is obtained irrespective of location. CSP infusion should be initiated 
first when possible but  can be infused concomitantly with other transfusion requirements per 
institutional standard care.  
 
Standard Care Arm : Patients randomized to the standard care arm will receive resuscitation, 
blood and blood component transfusion per site standard care.  
 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    9  
 Randomization and Masking  
Individual patients meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria in the  emergency department 
will be randomized and assigned according to a 1:[ADDRESS_1217891] and full traceability is required. 
Arm assignment will be concealed to all outcome assessors.  
 
IV. Outcomes  
 
Primary Outcome : The primary outcome for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_363382]. Secondary performance 
and feasibility outcomes will include  1) the proportion of eligible patients that can be 
randomized , 2) the proportion of eligible patients who are enrolled in the trial, 3) proportion of 
enrolled patients which adherence to the study protocol, and 4) proportion of enrolled patients 
who complete study follow -up. 
 
Secondary Outcomes : Our principal secondary clinical outcome for the trial will be 24 hour 
mortality. Additional secondary outcomes for the proposal will include 3-hour m ortality, in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], 30 -day mortality, death from hemorrhage, blood and blood component 
transfusion requirements in the initial 24 hours, incidence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
(ARDS), time to hemostasis, incidence of coagulopathy by [CONTACT_506083], incidence of 
allergic/transfusion reaction, incidence of transfusion related acute lung injury 
(TRALI), measurements of platelet hemostatic function , and incidence of thromboembolic 
events . 
 
Seco ndary Outcome Definitions : 
 
3-hour , 24-hour, In- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16813] 30- day mortality:  3-hour , 24-hour, in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16813] [ADDRESS_1217892] 24- hour period.  
 
Mortality from hemorrhage: Cause of death will be adjudicated by a site investigator 
who is blinded to the arm of the trial.  
 
24-hour blood and blood component transfusion requirements:  24-hour blood and 
blood component transfusion requirements will be determined by [CONTACT_872022], the number of units transfused, and the time of transfusion from the time of 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    10  
 randomization and the intervention completed. Any initiation of blood transfusion will be 
considered completed.  
 
Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS ): The Berlin definition for mild ARDS 
(PaO 2/FIO 2, ≤ 300 mm Hg + timing, imaging and origin criteria) will be utilized as a 
threshold value to determine the incidence o f ARDS and will be further stratified into 
Moderate (PaO 2/FIO 2, ≤ 200 mm Hg) and Severe (PaO 2/FIO 2, ≤ 100 mm Hg).23 
 
Coagulation parameters:  Data will be obtained from clinical labs drawn d uring the first 
60 minutes for PT, INR and point of care rapid- TEG analysis. Data from t hese 
measurements will also be obtained from clinical draws performed  as close to 24 hours 
from the time of arrival as feasible.  
 
Time to hemostasis : The time to hemostasis outcome variable will be determined by [CONTACT_355086] a nadir transfusion requirement of [ADDRESS_1217893] 4 hours, the patient will be designated a ‘non- hemostasis’ patient.  
 
Allergic/Transfusion reaction : Any transfusion complication in the ED and OR/IR 
setting will be monitored. As the intervention is specific to the early phase of care setting and since transfusion complications are temporally related to the specific transfusion, all 
transfusion related complications will be assessed during the initial 24 hours from arrival 
and recorded.  
 
Transf usion Related Acute Lung I njury (TRALI ): TRALI will be defined as the 
occurrence of ARDS (mild ; PaO 2/FIO 2, ≤ 300 mm Hg) that occurs within [ADDRESS_1217894]. There may be multiple blood products transfused to the 
patient including FDP, PRBC’s, plasma, platelet during the early resuscitation period. 
The causal factor that results in TRALI may be unab le to be determined but will be 
recorded.24,25 
 
Platelet hemostatic function : We will assess platelet count utilizing standard 
hematology testing technique and platelet hemostatic function utilizing the TEG 
parameter Maximal Amplitude (MA).  
 
Thromboembolic events :  Pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, or arterial 
thrombosis that occurs during the primary admission hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872010]. Radiographic confirmation via CT imaging, transthoracic or trans -
esophageal echo, or ventilation/perfusion scanning will be required. Presumed or clinical suspi [INVESTIGATOR_872011].     
 
Classification of Mortality : Classification of the underlying mechanisms responsible for 
mortality are essential to appropriately characterize regional variation and preventable morbidity 
Version 7: 12/17/[ADDRESS_1217895] of mortality classifications will 
be provided and adjudicated upon at the site level and will include  
1) Hemorrhage/Exsanguination, 2) TBI/herniation, 3) Multisystem Organ Failure, 4) Se psis, 5) 
ARDS, 6) Coagulopathy, 7) Cardiac Arrest with 1- 6, 8) Pulmonary Embolism, 9) Withdrawal of 
Care as well as other pertinent causes of injury related death.  
 
Predefined Subgroups : Predefined subset analyses will be performed looking at 1) Patients 
who ultimately did or did not required in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507441]; 2) Patients with and without 
significant traumatic brain injury (Head abbreviated injury score - AIS >2); 3) Patients arrived 
from the scene of injury versus those brought from a  referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; 4) Patients who ultimately 
did or did not require massive transfusion (≥ [ADDRESS_1217896] 24hrs). 5) CSPs with shelf 
time of [ADDRESS_1217897] , including point of care rapid or conventional 
thromboelastography (TEG) performed for coagulation parameter measurements within 60 
minutes of patient arrival and at 24 hours when feasible and with flexible time range +/ -12hours.  
 
VI. Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
The analysis will begin by [CONTACT_872023] a nd clinical characteristics of the 
overall population and then stratified by [CONTACT_872024]. For discrete variables, proportions will be generated, and a chi -
square test will be used to te st for differences between the proportions. For continuous 
characteristics, means (medians) and standard deviations (interquartile ranges) will be calculated 
and t -tests (Wilcoxon) will be used to compare the means (distributions) between treatment arms.  
 
Eligibility, Enrollment, and Subject Accrual : The feasibility of enrollment will be evaluated by 
[INVESTIGATOR_16598]  1) the proportion of eligible patients that can be randomized and 2) the proportion of 
eligible patients who are enrolled in the trial, 3) proport ion of enrolled patients which adherence 
to the study protocol, and 4) proportion of enrolled patients who complete study follow -up.  
These proportions will be estimated directly as the observed ratio of numbers of patients, and 
95% confidence intervals wi ll be calculated to understand the likely range of values for a larger 
study with a comparable research protocol and population. The reasons why patients are not 
enrolled including frequencies of individual exclusions and the proportion of patients declini ng 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    12  
 participation or not able to be randomized will be described. Rate of subjects’ accrual per month 
with 95% C.I. will be calculated.  
 
Analysis for Trial Clinical Outcomes : For the primary trial outcome, an indicator of death 
within [ADDRESS_1217898] of CSP on 24 hour survival after controlling f or 
potential confounding effects of baseline characteristics which reveal imbalance between treatment groups. The same analytic approach will be used for other binary outcomes (e.g., 
mortality from hemorrhage).   
 
For continuous outcomes (e.g., number of units transfused), a t -test or Wilcoxon test will be used 
to compare the number of units transfused between the two treatment group.  An analysis of covariance model will be used to estimate the independent effect o f treatment after controlling 
for the potential confounding effects of baseline characteristics which reveal imbalance between treatment groups  
 For time to event outcomes (e.g., time to hemostasis), Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated for 
each treatment  group and a log- rank test will be used to compare the distribution of the 
cumulative proportion.
 Cox proportional hazard regression analyses will then be used to estimate 
the independent effect of treatment after controlling for the potential confounding effects of baseline characteristics which reveal imbalance between treatment groups.  
  
Analyses to test for the homogeneity of the treatment effect will be carried out for the pre -
defined subgroups.  Regression models appropriate for the outcome variable ( e.g., logistic 
regression for binary outcome variables) will be used to test for the homogeneity of the treatment effect.  Main effects will be included in the model for treatment, the indicator of the subgroup 
and the two- way interaction between treatment  and subgroup.  If a statistically significant 
interaction is observed, we will reject the null hypothesis of a homogenous treatment effect.   
 
Secondary analyses will be conducted to assess aim 3.  These analyses will be carried out among 
those who are randomly assigned to the CSP group and the impact of the age of the CSP on 
outcomes will be evaluated.  Since the  secondary  sample will not be randomly assigned, it will 
be important to adjust for potential confounding effects.  A propensity score will be generated as an indicator of the age of the CSP (<= 7 days vs. > 7 days).  Multivariable regression models will 
be used to assess the independent relationship of age of the CSP on outcome.  The model type 
will vary based on the outcome (e.g., logistic regr ession for binary variables).  Each model will 
include a fixed main effect for the indicator of the age of the CSP as well as an inverse probability weight for the propensity of getting CSP <= [ADDRESS_1217899] 
between those that received whole blood and those that did not. A dose response analysis will 
similarly be performed to characterize the number of transfusions of cold stored platelets a 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    13  
 patient receives and associations wi th primary and secondary outcomes (cold stored platelet 
transfusion and or whole blood transfusion which includes cold stored platelets)  
 
Sample Size Justification and Power Analysis (n=200) : For the enrollment, adherence and 
event rates needed for planning and feasibility analyses, we calculated the two -sided 95% CI for 
proportions ranging from 0.7 to 0.9. For example, a sample size of 200 produces a two- sided 
95% CI of 0.85 to 0.94 when the sample proportion is 0.90. When the sample proportion is .70, 
the two-sided CI is 0.63 to 0.76. These confidence intervals are then repeated within the 
treatment arm.

100 0.13 0.900  0.82 0.95 
 For the primary clinical outcome of 24 -hour mortality, based on a 2x2 (treatment x 24- hour 
mortality) there is 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.1981 (which translates into the ability to detect a 14.2% difference from a mortality rate of 23% in the control group) assuming a type I 
error rate of 0.05, a two -sided alternative hypothesis, [ADDRESS_1217900] size will increase 
to 0.2180 which translates into 80% power  to detect a  statistically significant difference between 
the two groups, assuming a true difference of  15.3%.  
      
Randomization of Ineligib le Subjects : It is anticipated that there will be a small proportion of 
patients enrolled who receive CSPs or standard care that in retrospect will not have met the entry criteria and are thus ineligible. In this circumstance, patients will be analyzed according to th e 
group to which they were randomized. Subgroup analyses based on eligibility criteria will be performed if the number of patients so affected is large. However, based on the relatively limited 
inclusion and exclusion criteria it is anticipated that the fr equency of this event will be low.   
 
Non-adherence : In some circumstances, patients may receive standard care instead of the CSPs 
intervention when randomized to CSPs. Non- adherence is most likely to occur in the case of the 
patient who requires urgent neurosurgical intervention and despi[INVESTIGATOR_872012], are not used. Fortunately, this event is relatively rare. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_392216]- to-treat analytic 
design, these patients will be analyzed with the group to which they were randomiz ed. 
 
Interim Analyses : The primary safety outcome will be 24 -hour mortality. The analyses 
described earlier will be carried out twice, once when half of the sample has completed the 
assessment of the endpoint and once when the complete sample has completed the assessment of 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    14  
 the endpoint.  To control for overall type I error a Bonferonni correction will be employed, 
allocating 0.025 of the type I error to each analysis.   
 
Data Sources : Data will be collected prospectively as patient care progresses. This wi ll include 
a review of the emergency  medical patient care report(s), Emergency Department and electronic/ 
paper hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  
 
In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392096] : Demographics, injury characteristics, ED vitals, ED 
interventions (chest tubes, intubation), injury severity, operative interventions and timing 
of interventions, injury severity score, ICU days, ventilator days, length of stay.  
 
Data Entry : The DCC will create web -based HTML forms to collect necessary information from 
all participating sites. Web entry forms will have dynamic features such as edit and data type 
checks. Details and clarification about data items will be provided using pop- up windows. Data 
encryption and authentication methods will be used. Additional features will be built into the web entry forms including: forms transmission history, access to past forms, tracking of data 
corrections, and the capability to save and re -load incomplete forms. The subjects will be 
identified by a study number only. All clinical intervent ions will become part of the patient’s 
medical records including platelet  transfusion.  All hard copy source documentation will be kept 
in a secured, locked cabinet in the site’ s research coordinator ’s office. All study documents will 
be maintained in a se cure location for the time frame designated by [CONTACT_133032] ’s 
requirements. The electronic data will be entered and maintained on a password protected SSL website designed for this trial.  
 The data entered for the CriSP -HS trial will be maintained by [CONTACT_507502] a relational database. 
The database would be housed in a virtual environment so in the event of a hardware failure it would migrate to a new host. The data will be backed on a regular schedule with full transaction 
log files in use and copi[INVESTIGATOR_507452] a secure service. In addition to 
the data server, the production web server will also be backed up routinely and as a virtual machine can be transitioned to different hardware automatically  in case of hardware failure.  All 
Servers are behind an enterprise firewall and access has to be granted through the firewall even within the University Network.   
 
Database Management : A two -tiered database structure will be created. A front -end database 
will serve the web entry needs, using a database management system well -suited to handling 
updates from multiple interactive users. The data from this database will be transferred on a 
regular schedule to a data repository that can be used by [CONTACT_108250]. These 
datasets will be the basis for data queries, analyses and monitoring reports. Various versions of 
this database will be kept as needed, e.g. for quarterly performance reports. Access to data will 
be limited to those who need access  to perform their tasks. The database management system is 
able to manage large quantities of data, to merge data from multiple databases as required, to handle complex and possibly changing relationships, and to produce analysis datasets that can be 
impor ted into a variety of statistical analysis packages.  
 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    15  
 Surveillance for Outcomes and Data Elements : Data will be collected prospectively as patient 
care progresses. This will include a review of the emergency medical patient care report(s), 
Emergency Department and electronic/ paper hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].

ventilator days, length of stay, multiple organ dysfunction scores (daily), nosocomial 
infectious outcomes, blood gas results, cxray reads, transfusion of blood and blood 
components, resuscitation requirements, all primary and secondary outcomes will be

VII. Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC)  
 
Clinical Coordination specific for the CriSP -HS study will be performed by [CONTACT_355091] 
(Multidisciplinary Acute Care Research Organization) and their dedicated research teams at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], including all regulatory requirements, provider and coordinator training 
and monitoring.  
 
VIII. Data Coordinating Center (DCC)  
 
Data Coordination specific for the CriSP -HS study will be performed by [CONTACT_507503]. 
Wisniewski at the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. The DCC will coordinate all data collection and entry, management, security and confidentiality, data 
archiving, quality control and electronic medical record biomedical informatics as needed, as well as plan, coordinate and assist with all statistical analyses.  
IX. Hum an Subjects  
 
We anticipate that this study will be conducted under the federal provisions governing Exception 
from the Requirement for Informed Consent for Emergency Research, including community consultation, public notification, as well as notification of patients or their legally -authorized 
representative as soon as feasible after enrollment. The latter shall include provision of an 
opportunity to opt out from ongoing participation that will be given through oral and written 
communication.    
 Due to the nature of the population and the very limited therapeutic window, w e anticipate that 
prospective informed consent will not be feasible. The patient and/or family member or LAR will be informed at the earliest feasible opportunity of the subject’s inclusion in the clinical trial 
and will be asked t o provide consent for continuing participation.  The investigator s will 
summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_872025]. The investigators will utilize available 
information and resources, such as social workers or social work notes, to try to locate the 
patient's legally authorized representative. If that search is unsuccessful, and the subject remains 
incapacitated, a notification letter will be sent to the subje ct's authorized representative 
Version 7: 12/17/[ADDRESS_1217901] 
becomes competent prior to discharge, then s /he will be approached for notification of 
enrollment and continued informed consent . At any circumstance a subject or their legally 
authorized representative will have an opportunity to opt out of ongoing participation without penalty or loss of benefits. If the subject dies before notification and consent can be obtained , a 
letter notification will be sent to the subject's family member to inform them that the subject was enrolled in this study.  
 Community consultation as determined by [CONTACT_507504]. We will utilize a central IRB at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Since the population eligible for enrollment includes all citizens in the study regions it will not be possible to target 
any particular small group. Feedback from the community will be obtained by [CONTACT_507505]. If requested, bracelets will be 
made available that could be wo rn by [CONTACT_507506]. 
Public notification and community consultation will be performed as directed by [CONTACT_872026], targeted small 
group meetings or consultation with community leaders. Due to ongoing participation in 
numerous multicenter research studies involving emergency research, our institution and the 
other participating institutions have significant experience with community consultation and 
notification practices.  
 
Study risks and benefits : Risks associated with blood component transfusion include infection, 
allergic reaction, fever, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  Additional risks associated with platelet transfusion include bacterial contamination, platelet alloimmunization, and hemolysis.  Due to 
the higher activation in CSP as compared to RTP, there is a potential for increased risk of thrombotic complications.  A detailed list of risks associated with the transfusion of platelets is 
included in the Investigator Brochure.  
 Regardless of arm, we anticipate that enrolled subjects will benefit from increased monitoring o f 
primary and secondary outcomes, with particular focus on coagulopathy due to the focus of the trial.  
 
Insti tutional Review Board : A central IRB will be utilized at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507456]. All current LITES Network sites have IRBs which have experience and engagement with central IRB procedures.  
 
Training and Participating Site Coordination : As the clinical coordinating center for the trial, 
the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (MACRO) at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_872013], provider training and sample  collection and 
storage. Research coordinators, providers and associated staff will be trained during the months prior to the trial start date regarding the scientific basis for the study, specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, sample collection and pr ocessing, study procedures and SOPs, and rapid TEG 
performance. Training verification and retraining will occur if new staff is hired at individual participating sites.  
 
Version 7: 12/17/[ADDRESS_1217902] medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
      b. Adverse reaction means  any adverse event caused by a drug.   Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions  where there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event.  
c. Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction” 
d. Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse 
event.  
e. Unexpected adverse event/reaction  refers to an event/reaction that is not consistent wit h 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the IND 
application.  
f. Life -threatening, suspected adverse reaction.  A suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal 
investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include a suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused  death.  
f. Serious, suspected adverse reaction . A suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” 
if, in the view of the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse reaction, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
g. Reportable non -compliance  refers to a failure on the part of the investigator or study team 
member to follow the terms of the IRB approved protocol or abide by [CONTACT_357529], that adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects or significantly 
compromises the quality of the research data.  Incidents of non- compliance on the part of the  
subject are not  considered reportable.  
h. Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) refers to any 
accident, experience, or outcome that meets the following criteria: unexpected in terms of 
nature, severity or frequency; related, or possibly rel ated, to a subject’s participation in 
research; and places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, economic, or social) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Assessing and Reporting Adverse Events (AEs)  and Non- compliance : Adverse events will be 
reviewed  by [CONTACT_507508].  Investigators 
and study team will determine if any related adverse events  occur during the period from 
enrollment  through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . If rep ortable adverse events  occur, they will be recorded 
on the adverse event case report form  in the electronic data capture system , which will be 
submitted to the  Coordinating Center . All reported adverse events  will be classified by:  a) 
Severity ( fatal or life -threatening, serious , or non- serious); and b) Expected vs. Unexpected.   An 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    18  
 event will be determined to be unexpected if it is not consistent with the risks identified in the 
Investigator’s Brochure  or with the information provided in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the IND application .  Please refer to the table below for timelines for reporting.  
 
This study population is expected to have a large number of serious adverse events , including 
death from trauma related injuries .  Expected  adverse events that are related or possibly related 
to the intervention  will be documented and reviewed for changes in nature, severity, or frequency  
across the study population.

Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) : A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
created to review this study and provide recommendations re. study continuation to the IND 
Sponsor.  After initial approval and at periodic intervals (to be determined by [CONTACT_942]) 
during the course of the study, the DSMB responsibilities are to:  
 
a. Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and safety 
monitoring; 
b. Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and 
timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 
adverse events, unanticipated problems, performance of the trial sites, and other factors 
that can affect study outcome;  
c. Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such 
as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    19  
 participants or the ethics of the study;  
d. Review clinical center performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution 
of pr oblems reported by [CONTACT_507509];  
e. Protect the safety of the study participants;  
f. Report on the safety and progress of the study;  
g. Make recommendations to the IND Sponsor, and if required, to the FDA concerning continuat ion, termination or other modifications of the study based on the observed 
beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
h. Monitor the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring;  
i. Assist the IND Sponsor by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, sample size and/or data collection.  
j. The DSMB will include experts in emergency medicine, surgery (trauma/critical medicine ), hematology,  bioethics  and biostatistics.  Members will consist of persons 
indepe ndent of the investigators who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of 
interest with the study.  Written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest 
will be required.   
k. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68344],  Health Sciences will provide 
the logistical management and support of the DSMB.  A safety officer (chairperson) will 
be identified at the first meeting.  This person will be the contact [CONTACT_68403].  Procedures for this will  be discussed at the first meeting.  
l. The first meeting will take place before initiation of the study to discuss the protocol, approve the commencement of the study, and to establish guidelines to monitor the study. 
The follow -up meeting frequency of the  DSMB will be determined during the first meeting.  
An emergency meeting of the DSMB will be called at any time by [CONTACT_414137].  
XI. Quality Control, Assurance and Confidentiality  
 
Protocol Complianc e: The participating study site Investigators will not deviate from the 
protocol for any reason without prior written approval from the IRB except in the event of the 
safety of the research subject. In that event, the study site Investigator will notify the I ND 
Sponsor and reviewing IRB immediately, if possible, and request approval of the protocol deviation, or, if prospective IND Sponsor and IRB approval is not possible, the study site 
Investigator will notify the IND Sponsor and reviewing IRB promptly following the respective 
protocol deviation. The study site Investigator will inform the reviewing IRB of all protocol 
deviations and unanticipated events involving risks to the research subjects and others, and will 
obtain prospective IRB approval for all proposed protocol changes. Persistent or serious 
noncompliance may result in termination of the study site’s participation in the research study.  
 
Protocol Deviations : Due to the relative focused inclusion criteria and the short intervention 
period, we expect few protocol deviations as compared to other large multicenter trials. If 
monitoring reports demonstrate evidence of continuing protocol deviations, we will analyze them 
to determine if they are site specific or common across the study. We will note if specific 
inclusion or exclusion criteria are being misinterpreted, if a certain time point in testing is being 
omitted, or if a common set of data elements are missing. If the deviations are site specific, 
retraining will be done at the site. If the problems are study wide, we will discuss them with the 
Version 7: 12/17/2021    20  
 other investigators, the DOD and the FDA to see if the protocol needs  to be  amended or 
recruitment put on hold.  
 
Privacy and Confidentiality : The study site Investigator’s and members of their research team 
will make reasonable effort to ensure the research subjects’ confidentiality. Subject name [CONTACT_872034] a secure, locked, limited access area.  
 
Investigator Responsibilities : 
The study site Investigators will agree to imp lement the IRB approved protocol and conduct the 
study in accordance with Section 9 (Commitments) of Form FDA 1572, 21 CFR Part 312, 
Subpart D, and the ICH GCP Guidelines (E6, Section 5) as well as all applicable national, state 
and local laws. The study w ill be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements.

XIII. Appendix I Requirements for Exception From Consent For 
Emergency Research  
 
We have outlined below each criterion stipulated in the regulations for this exception and how 
our study design applies to these criteria.  
 
(1) The human subjects are in a life- threatening situation, available treatments are 
unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may 
include evidence obtained through randomized placebo- controlled investigations, is 
neces sary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.  
 
The proposed trial is a randomized trial comparing the use of cold stored platelets  versus 
standard of care in patients in hemorrhagic shock following injury requiring operative 
management.  These patients are in a life- threatening situation with a mortality before discharge 
approaching 30- 40% despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510]. The standard of care for management of these patients 
generally includes component resuscitation.  Importantly, prior studies have demonstrated that 
injured patients who require large volume blood transfusion have improved survival if 
transfusion of high or equal ratios of plasm a and platelets to blood occurs. Evidence suggests 
that early blood component transfusion may reduce overall blood transfusion requirements and 
that addressing the coagulopathy which occurs early after injury improves outcome.  
 (2) Obtaining informed cons ent is not feasible because:  
i. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical 
condition;  
ii. The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the 
subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and  iii. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become 
eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.  
 
The study intervention needs to be administered quickly after arrival to the trauma center  (see 
discussion of therapeutic window below). In this  chaotic  initial treatment phase,  the hemorrhagic 
shock patient is unable to provide consent for study enrollment,  as they are commonly 
unconscious or in extremis, and legal next -of-kin are often not immediately available, nor is it 
practical for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872015] . Since we are studying patients with hemorrhagic shock following injury, 
there is no way to prospectively identify individuals who are likely to become eligible for this trial.  
 
(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects 
because:  
i. Subje cts are facing a life- threatening situation that necessitates intervention;  
ii. Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the 
information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the 
interve ntion to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and  
iii. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of 
Version 7: 12/17/[ADDRESS_1217910] t herapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed 
intervention or activity.  
 
(i) As defined, these patients are injured and in hemorrhagic  shock and are facing a potentially 
life-threatening situation that requires immediate i ntervention.  
(ii) Previous  animal and human studies suggest the potential for a direct benefit to individual 
patients who are in hemorrhagic shock.  
(iii) Platelets have been shown to provide a survival benefit for massive transfusion.  The current 
protoc ol will allow early access to these benefits as compared to current standard care.  Whole 
blood has been evaluated in military and civilian settings, which contains cold stored platelets   
 
(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out  without the waiver.  
This study could not be conducted without the waiver of consent due to the need to initiate the 
intervention quickly upon arrival for  hemorrhagic shock  patients  at significant risk of mortality.  
 
(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic 
window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting 
to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time 
and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contact[CONTACT_872027]. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_872028].  
 Patients in hemorrhagic shock following injury have been shown to develop progressive 
hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis leading to further recalcitrant hemorrhage and 
multisystem organ failure and death.  It has been shown that an increased mortality of 1%  is 
demonstrated for every 3 minutes of delay to the operating room a patient has.  In a recent study 
from PROPPR, every 1 min delay in blood products getting to the patients is as sociated with a 
5% higher mortality. These data demonstrate the potential therapeutic window in 1- [ADDRESS_1217911] legal representatives as soon as 
feasible to notify them that the patient was enrolled in a randomized trial  and will attempt to 
obtain their informed consent to continue participation. A summary of these efforts will be 
documented in the patient’s  chart. If the subject becomes competent during the study period,  
then he/she will be approached by [CONTACT_872029] . 
 
 (6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed 
consent document consistent with Sec. 50.25. These procedures and the informed 
consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized 
representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. 
The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when 
providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the 
clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.  
 
All procedures and consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_872030] 
(sIRB) of the study prior to the onset of the trial.  
 (7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, 
including, at least:  
Version 7: 12/17/2021    24  
 i. Consultation (inc luding, where appropriate, consultation carried out by [CONTACT_1201]) with 
representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducte d 
and from which the subjects will be drawn;  
ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be 
conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical 
investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits;  
iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information fol lowing completion of the clinical 
investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the 
demographic characteristics of the research population, and its results;  
iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of 
the clinical investigation; and  
v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact [CONTACT_872031]'s family member who is not a legally 
authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's 
participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to 
contact [CONTACT_5569] m embers and make this information available to the IRB at the time of 
continuing review.  
 
(i) Community consultation as outlined by [CONTACT_507517]. Since the population eligible for enrollment includes all citizens in the study region it will not be 
possible to target any particular small group. Feedback from the community will be obtained by [CONTACT_759976]. If requested, bracelets will be made available t hat could be worn by [CONTACT_872032]. Public notification and community consultation will be performed 
as directed by [CONTACT_872033], tar geted small group meetings or consultation with community leaders. Our 
institution has significant experience with community consultation and notification practices.  
(ii) & (iii) Public disclosures will be performed both prior to study enrollment and at t he 
completion of the study in the form of multimedia press releases organized by [CONTACT_473]. These will include plans for the study including potential risks and benefits and a summary of 
the results of the study upon completion. In the event that t he press releases are not widely 
circulated, advertisements may  also be placed in local papers describing the study.  
(iv) The Data Safety Monitoring Board will function as an independent data monitoring 
committee who will exercise oversight of the study.   An independent Research Monitor will also 
be appointed per Department of Defense requirement.  
(v) We expect that all patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be unconscious or in critical 
state that does not allow appropriate consent to occur . Any delay in medical care that would be 
required for the care provider to attempt to obtain consent from the patient’s legal guardian would be life threatening. Thus,  it will not be feasible to attempt to obtain informed consent 
during the initial therap eutic window. Requiring consent to review a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872016] a biased estimate of the safety and efficacy of the intervention. Therefore,  we will use exception fro m 
consent for emergency research which includes public notification, community consultation, patient notification of enrollment, and provision of an opportunity to opt out from ongoing participation.

3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Primary Objective: The primary objective is to confirm the specificity of  the 
multi -target stool DNA  test (mt-sDNA), Cologuard , in an 
average risk population, ages 4 5-49.    
Study Design: Prospective, cross -sectional, multi -center study  
Investigational Device  Multi -target stool DNA test (mt-sDNA) , Cologuard , 
(Exact Sciences, Madison, WI)  
Population: Subjects 45-49 years of age who are at average risk for 
development of CRC . 942 subjects are targeted to 
enroll . 
Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint of this study is specificity of the 
mt-sDNA test (Cologuard) in the 45 -49 age group in an 
average risk population, using colonoscopy with 
histopathology (when required) as the reference 
method.  The primary analysis requires the one -sided 
97.5% lower bound of the specificity of Cologuard to 
exceed 85.0%.  
Study Duration:  Duration of study participation for each subject will be 
approximately  60 days  from enrollment into the study . 
Study Procedures: Subjects providing written informed consent to 
participate in the study will complete the mt -sDNA test 
(Cologuard) followed by  a screening colonoscopy which 
should be completed within approximately 60 days of 
enrollment. Subjects may also choose to consent to 
2018 -10B and provide a blood sample at the time of 
enrollment.

 4 BACKGROUND / RATIONALE  
4.1 Background  
The 2018 American Cancer  Society colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guideline [1] now recommends 
initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening at age 45 in average risk individuals. This change in a 
prominent national guideline was based on recent data [2 ] showing that the incidenc e of CRC in the 40 -
49 age group has increased with that of the 45-49-year-old group similar to that of 50-54-year-olds. There 
has been a 51% increase in the incidence of CRC from 1994 to 2014 and an 11% increase in mortality 
from [ADDRESS_996959] for their lifetimes. Compared to birth cohorts between 1890 -1950 where  the rate of CRC has 
been steadily declining, the rate in those generations born after 1950 has been steadily increasing. The 
ACS estimates that in 2014, over 7,073 cases of CRC were diagnosed in individuals age d 45 to 49 years 
with over 16,450 cases diagnosed in patients under 50 .   
 Rising incidence of CRC in 40 -49-year-olds compared to decreasing incidence in t hose 50 years 
of ag e and older  (from  Siegel R et al JNCI 2017 [2]). 
 
Previously, a recommendation for starting at age 45 in average risk ind ividuals was proposed by [CONTACT_941] 2009 
American College of Gastroenterology  guideline in African Americans [3] and reiterated in the 2017 U.S. 
Multi -Society Task Force CRC screening guideline [4]. The USMSTF includes members of  the American 
Gastroenterological Association, the American College of Gastroenterology , and the American Society of 
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. While the 2016 [LOCATION_002] Preventive Services Task Force guideline did 
not recommend starting screening at age 45 [5] and continued to give it s “A” rating to screening average 
risk individuals from ages [ADDRESS_996960] region of Northwell Health , as quoted in the N .Y Times [6] , “Solid 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_729911] a dramatic increase in the incidence 
of colon and especially rectal cancer among individuals under the age of 50, and the vast majority of 
those cases are in the 40 - to 49 -year-old age bracket.”  
Importantly, the ACS guideline include s the multi -target stool DNA test as one of the recommended 
methods for CRC screening, including for the expanded age range of 45 -49 years  of age . The ACS 
Guideline development group states, “The GDG con cluded that mt -sDNA warrants inclusion among test 
options based on its sensitivity for detecting CRC, its improved advanced adenoma and serrated sessile  
polyp detection compared with FIT, and evidence indicating that some adults would choose screening 

   
Document  Type:  
Master Clinical Protocol 2018 -10 
 
9 Protocol 2018 -10 v2.0  
 with mt-sDNA over other CRC screening tests.” [7] Currently the labeled indication for mt -sDNA includes 
individuals [ADDRESS_996961] Sciences wishes to expand the labeled indication for mt -sDNA into 
this 45-49 age group.  
4.2 Rationale  
Given its high sensitivity for CRC and advanced pre -cancers demonstrated in the mt -s DNA pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] 
[8] and given the safety of mt -sDNA as a non -invasive stool -based test, mt -sDNA could be an important 
option for patients and providers in this younger age group.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study is designed to provide additional evidence of test performance in this age group to support a n 
application for FDA  label expansion. Biologically, there is little reason to beli eve there is a significant 
difference in the underlying mechanism of CRC in average risk individuals age [ADDRESS_996962]  (Cologuard ) in an average risk 
population, ages [ADDRESS_996963] (Cologuard) in the 45-49 age group in 
an average risk population , using colonoscopy wit h histopathology (when required) as the reference 
method.  The primary analysis requires the one -sided 9 7.5% lower bound of the specificity of Cologuard 
to exceed 85 .0%. 
6.2 Other Outcomes  
Other outcomes to be assessed include the following  
• Sensitivity for CRC  + advanced adenoma   
• The positive and negative predictive values  
• The positive and negative likelihood ratios  (PLR and NLR, respectively)  
• The distribution of colorectal epi[INVESTIGATOR_12184] (by [CONTACT_61117]) among positive mt-sDNA test 
(Cologuard ) subjects  
• The rate of no mt-sDNA ( Cologuard ) result

and scheduled for a screening colonoscopy.  Stool s ample collection must occur prior to subjects initiating 
bowel prep aration  for the colonoscopy  procedure . All subjects  will undergo  a screening colonoscopy  
within approximately [ADDRESS_996966] ( Cologuard ) will be compared with the results of the colonoscopy and 
with any corresponding diagnostic histopathology results from biopsies or excised tiss ues obtained for 
clinical purposes  to confirm the performance estimates.  
Stool s amples collected by [CONTACT_729918]-sDNA test ( Cologuard ) will be sent t o Exact Sciences 
Laboratories  and tested. Individuals conducting the mt -sDNA tests will be blinded to all subject clinical 
information, including colonoscopy results.  Investigators , subjects , and endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_729912]-sDNA test ( Cologuard ) result s, and the results of the test s will not be used for clinical management 
of study subjects.  
All subjects enrolled in the study will also be offered the opportunity to provide a blood sample for  
biomarker evaluation and assay optimization  (Protocol 2018 -10B). Blood samples will be used for  
research on biomarkers from plasma and serum.  
[ADDRESS_996967] (Cologuard) is a colorectal cancer screening option  that consists of a stool 
collection kit and proprietary assay methodologies for  the detection of fecal hemoglobin and fecal DNA 
markers known to be associated with CRC   
 Cologuard is approved  by [CONTACT_729919] [ADDRESS_996968] has not been evaluated in average risk individuals under the age of 
50. 
The Stool Collection Kit includes : Sample Collection Instructions , a stool collection container and support 
bracket, a bottle of liquid sDNA preservative, a fecal hemoglobin sample tube, return shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858], and 
return shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7801].  The stool collection kits will be labeled as investigational use only. The stool  
collection kits will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The sites are responsible for management of the stool  
collection kits. The investigator must maintain complete and current accountability  record s (including kit 
receipt, dispensation, and return)  for all kits supplied by [CONTACT_1034] .  All unused kits and their original 
packaging should be kept on -site for reconciliation by a site monitor. The site m ust return all  unused kits 
and packaging after accountability has been performed  at the end of the study . Stool  collection kit return  
must be documente d in the accountability  record s.

 Enrolled subjects will complete the mt -sDNA tes t (Cologuard) prior to bowel preparation for the 
colonoscopy  procedure . Subjects enrolled into the study will be provided with a Stool Collection Kit .  Stool 
samples must be collected prior to initiation of bowel preparation for the colonoscopy pr ocedure .  Stool 
samples will be collected by [CONTACT_729923]. Instruction s for kit return are provided to 
the subject with the Stool Collection Kit.  
The shipment and arrival of the Stool  Collection Kit at Exact Sciences  Laboratories  will be  tracked.  Once 
the sample arrives at Exact Sciences  Laboratories , it will be inspected for acceptability  per the 
specifications outlined in the Cologuard Instructions for Use . If the stool sample is not collected according 
to the instructions for use or dam aged in a way that compromises the specimen , a repeat sample 
collection may be requested if the collection can occur prior to the initiation of bowel preparation for the 
scheduled colonoscopy. The site will be asked to contact [CONTACT_729924] r stool specimen.  
At that time, another stool collection kit will be dispensed to the subject by [CONTACT_779].   
10.5 Sample Assays  
Assay results will be recorded as 'Positive', 'Negative', ’Sample Could Not Be Processed’, or ‘N o 
Result O btained. ’ If there are no valid results, a repeat test may be requested . Repeat stool sample 
requests will be sent to the site. Repeat stool sample collection must occur prior to bowel 
preparation for the colonoscopy procedure. If a valid stool sample result cannot be obtained for a 
subject after two (2) attempts, the subject will be withd rawn and may be replaced.   
 
The mt -sDNA test (Cologuard) result will not be provided to investigators  for clinical management of 
study subjects . All mt -sDNA test results will remain blinded to inv estigators  and study subjects .

Subject s who have poor bowel prep aration  and will not repeat the procedure or subjects who do not 
complete  a colonoscopy should be withdrawn  and may be replaced . Bowel preparation procedures and 
colonoscopy will be performed following the usual practice  at each clinical site. Personnel performing the 
colonoscopy and producing the resulting report and the personnel performing the histopathological 
review of tissue will remain blinded to the results of the mt-sDNA test (Cologuard)  result .

 Cecal intubation will be documented with photographic evidence and/or documentation of cecal 
intubation; and colonoscope withdra wal time will be recorded. Withdrawal time is defined as the time from 
cecal identification to the time when the colonoscope is withdrawn across the anus (Barclay, Vicari, 
Doughty, et al, 2006.).  
A bowel preparation considered excellent, good, or fair wil l be acceptable. Subjects with no findings on 
the colonoscopy, and no photographic evidence of cecal intubation or no documentation of cecal 
intubation in the report, will be deemed to have a failed colonoscopy. These subjects will be deemed to 
be unevalua ble and therefore will be excluded from analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
Those subjects determined to have had a poor bowel preparation (after washing/suctioning) may repeat 
the colonoscopy again if the Investigator feels this is in the be st interest for the subject. The subject may 
repeat the colonoscopy procedur e. A repeat stool specimen is not required.  
A completed colonoscopy procedure will be considered and defined as: reaching the cecum (or) reaching 
the junction between the small and large intestine (in the event the cecum has been resected) . 
A colonoscopy wherein a CRC  or AA was identified will be include d in the analyses  regardless of any 
limiting factors experienced during the colonoscopy . 
10.6.[ADDRESS_996980] of practice. 
Histopathology interpretation of tissue samples will be conducted according to each of the clinical site’s 
local histopathology practice provider(s) as  used for daily  patient management.  
Subjects who have lesions identified by [CONTACT_729925], therefore, not submitted for histopathologic 
analysis, will be identified by [CONTACT_30107] , and the colonoscopy report will be sent to the study central 
pathologist (s) for review. Because of the absence of confirmatory histopathologic diagnosis, these 
subjects will be excluded from the study based on the fact that they  cannot be categorized for the study 
analysis.  
The sites will grant independent central pathologist(s) access to colonoscopy, surgical , and 
histopathological reports by [CONTACT_729926] a copy of those reports. All protected health  information on 
the documents will be removed before release to the central pathologist (s). The study -specific subject 
identification number will be used to identify c olonoscopy reports and applicable histopathology reports  
submitted to the central patholo gist(s).  
Histopathological results will be categorized as defined in Appendix 4 . For subjects that undergo surgical 
removal of CRC and/or non -CRC lesions, an excisional surgical  pathology  report should be available. To 
ensure diagnostic accuracy, investiga tive sites with subjects diagnosed with CRCs or AAs may be 
required to provide representative histology slides for review by a central  pathologist. When the central 
pathologist histopathology result differs from the local histopathology result, the results  will be adjudicated 
with a review and interpretation by a second central pathologist.  
Patient management will be conducted locally at each investigative site based upon colonoscopy 
outcomes and the histopathology results reported by [CONTACT_729927] l ab. In the event that the 
centralized histopathology laboratory assigns a higher -grade  histology result than the local histopathology 
laboratory , the Investigator will be notified. The Investigator should maintain the central pathology results

An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or  disease temporally associated 
with the  use of an inv estigational product or protocol-impos ed intervention, regardless of attribution . 
 
 
    
 The liquid bu ffer/liquid p reservative in the  quantities provided is non -toxic. 
An AE may be investigated as an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) , if applicable.

16 Protocol 2018 -10 v2.0  
 Adverse events commonly associated with colonoscopy will not be collected. Such events 
include: Abdominal discomfort, bowel irregularity,  bleeding, intestinal perforation, and adverse 
reaction to the sedation.    
 
Surgical intervention, such as, but not limited to, colectomy and sub -mucosal resection are part 
of routine patient care for subjects with CRC or AA ; therefore, adverse events commonly 
associated with surgeries will not be collected. Such events include: Bleeding , blood clots in the 
legs (deep vein thrombosis) and lungs (pulmonary embolism); infection; injury to organs near the 
colon, such as the bladd er and small intestines; and tears in the sutures that reconnect the 
remaining parts of the digestive system.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_996986] (Cologuard ), specifically the stool sample collection procedure. AEs are collected 
from the time of enrollment to return of the Stool  Collection Kit.  All AEs will be  reported on the  adverse 
event page(s) of the CRF. 
11.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events are not expected for this study but will be reported to the Sponsor if they occur.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE th at results in one  or more of the following out comes. 
• Death; Not e: “Death” should not be  reported as an SAE.  The cause of death should be reported 
as the  SAE.  The  only exception is “Sudden Death” when the  cause is unknown.  
• A life-threatening illness or  injury; 
• A permanent imp airment of a body structure or a body function; 
• Required in-patient hosp italization or  prolongation of  existing  hospit alization; 
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to p revent permanent imp airment of a body 
structure or a body function; or  
• Fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
11.[ADDRESS_996987] (UADE) is “any serious adverse effect on h ealth or s afety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if th at effect, problem, or  death 
was not p revious ly identified in n ature, severity, or degree of incidence in the  investigational plan or 
application (including  a supp lementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious p roblem 
associated with a  device that relates to the  rights, s afety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR 812.3 (s)). 
11.[ADDRESS_996988] be  made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.

Master Clinical Protocol 2018 -10 
 
17 Protocol 2018 -10 v2.0  
 This tim eframe also applies to addition al new information (follow -up) on previous ly forwarded SAE 
reports. 
In the  rare event that the Investigator does not b ecome aware of the occurrence of a SAE imm ediately 
(e.g., if an outpatient stu dy subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the 
event within 24  hours after learning of it and document the  time of his/h er first awareness of the adverse 
event. 
For all SAEs, the  Investigator is obligated to pu rsue and provide in formation to E xact Sciences or its 
designee in accordance with the  timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, the Inv estigator 
may be requested by [CONTACT_729928] -up in formation in 
an expedited fashion. This in formation m ay be more detailed than that captured on the adverse event 
case report form. In general, this will in clude a description of  the adverse event in su fficient detail to allow 
for a complete medical assessment of the case and in dependent determination of  possible  causality. 
Information on other possible  causes of the event, su ch as concomitant medications and illn esses must 
be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summ ary of available autopsy findings must be  submitt ed 
as soon as possible  to Exact Sciences or its designee. SAEs may be reported to the local IRB/EC per 
institutional requirements.  
11.5.2  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be  reported on the  adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be  noted that the form for 
collection of  SAE information is not the  same as the  adverse event CRF. 
11.5.3  Reporting Requirements of Unanticipated Adverse Devices Effects (UADEs)  
All UADEs must be  reported by [CONTACT_729929] 3 d ays from identification or  
awareness of  the event.  Investigators are responsible  for preparing and submitting complete, accurate, 
and tim ely reports to the  reviewing IRB/EC  of any UADE occurring during an investigation as soon as 
possibl e, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_996989] atistical analyse s of the data collected in this stu dy will 
be documented in a  Statistical Analysis Plan.  This do cument may modify the plans outlin ed in the  
protocol; how ever, any major modifications of  the primary endpoint d efinition and/or  its analysis 
will also be  reflected in a  protocol amendment.

12.[ADDRESS_996990] (Cologuard) in the 45 -49 
age group in an average risk population, using colonoscopy with histopathology (when required) 
as the reference method.  The primary analysis requires the on e-sided 9 7.5% lower bound of the 
specificity of Cologuard to exceed 85 .0%. 
 
The primary endpoint  of this study is to confirm the specificity of the mt-sDNA  test (Cologuard ) in 
the [ADDRESS_996991] result to the results of optical colonoscopic examination and confirmation of the 
colonoscopic findings by [CONTACT_26745], if appropriate.  
 
Possible categories of colonoscopic findings are as follows:  
 1. CRC, all stages (I -IV); 
 2. Advanced adenoma, including the following subcategories:  
2.1 Adenoma with carcinoma in situ  or high -grade dysplasia, any size  
2.2 Adenoma, villous growth pattern ( > 25%), any size  
2.3 Adenoma > 10 mm in size, or  
2.4 serrated lesion, > 10 mm in size;  
 3. 1 or 2 adenoma(s), > 5 mm in size, or < 10 mm size, non -advanced;  
 4. > 3 adenomas, < 10 mm in size, non -advanced;  
 5. 1 or 2 adenoma(s), < 5 mm in size, non -advanced;  
 6. Negative – no neoplastic findings, includi ng the following subcategories:  
6.1 Negative , no colorectal neoplasia upon histopathological review  
6.2 No findings on colonoscopy, no biopsy(s) taken

19 Protocol 2018 -10 v2.0  
  
Subjects with colonoscopic findings in categories 3-6 above will be included in the specificity analysis as 
negative outcomes for the primary endpoint calculation.  Thus, specificity to advanced neoplasia ( AN) will 
be calculated for the primary endpoint evaluation. The colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 'negative' population (category 6) 
will include those subjects with a colonoscopy showing no findings  of colorectal neoplasia , non -neoplastic 
disease, and/or hyperplastic polyps < [ADDRESS_996992] occult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on 
colonoscopy will be excluded from  all analyses.  Subjects with unevaluable Exact CRC screening test 
results will be excluded from the primary endpoint analyses. All excluded cases will be assessed for bias.  
Subjects with colonoscopic/histopathologic findings in category 1 (confirmed color ectal cancer cases) will 
be considered to have a positive outcome and will be included in the CRC sensitivity calculations. Note: 
Due to the low prevalence of CRC in the Age 45 -49 group, there will likely be no CRC prospectively enrolled 
in the study, so n o endpoints will be designed around CRC sensitivity. Similarly, due to the low prevalence 
of AA in the Age 45 -49 group there may only be approximately 29 subjects*  with 
colonoscopic/histopathologic findings in category 2 (advanced adenomas) prospectively e nrolled in the 
study, so no endpoints will be designed around AA sensitivity .  
*Advanced adenoma prevalence among never -screened individuals aged 4 5-49 years may be  derived, 
based on simulation results, to be 3.92%. 731*3.92%= 29 [9]. 
 
12.3 Sample Size  and Rule  Out Lower Threshold  Justification  
The minimum number of non -advanced neoplasia and negative instance s (categories 3 -6.2) needed to 
rule out an 85 .0% lower bound on the specificity with 90% power for a one -sided test with 2.5% Type [ADDRESS_996993] binomial distribution is 225, as outlined in Table 1. Furthermore, the minimum 
sample size needed such that the confidence interval width for the alternative proportion (92.2%) is within 
+/-2.2% (i.e. 92.2%+/ -2.2% = 90.0%/94.4%) is 731. Using this sa mple size, the power of the study is 
>99.99% . 
 
Table 1: One-sided Exact Test Power: Single Proportion  
 
Sample Size Scenarios  [ADDRESS_996994]  1 1 
Null hypothesis proportion  85.0%  85.0%  
Alternative Proportion  92.2%  92.2%  
Power (%)  90% >99.99% 
# Non -CRC/AA Cases  225 731 
 
The alternative proportion of 92.2% is the observed specificity in the DeeP -C study [SSED P130017, 
Source: fda.gov] for the age group [ADDRESS_996995] age category.  The null hypothesis 
proportion of 85 .0% is identical to specificity null hypothesis used in the DeeP -C study ( NCT).

Master Clinical Protocol 2018 -10 
 
20 Protocol 2018 -10 v2.0  
  
A minimum sam ple size of 193 evaluable subjects (age 45 -49 inclusive)  is required to adequately power 
the primary analysis . This minimum sample size requirement will be adjusted to 731 to more accurately 
estimate the specificity by [CONTACT_729930].  The total enrollment target is  adjusted to  942 to account for 
a 3% prevalence of advance neoplasia and a 20% drop out rate . 
12.3.1  Analysis Approach , Primary Effectiveness Analysis    
Primary Effectiveness Analysis:   
The primary analysis for mt-sDNA test (Cologuard) specif icity will be performed using an exact binomial 
(Clopper -Pearson) test to compute the one -sided 9 7.5% lower bound; the lower bound must exceed 
85.0%. Specificity will be assessed for a random sample of 731 colonoscopy negatives.   
Rejecting  the null hypoth esis will demonstrate the Specificity in the Age 45 -49 group is no worse  than the 
pre-specified lower bound limit established in the DeeP -C protocol.   
 
12.4 Other Prespecified Analyses  
• Analysis of distribution of test performance by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity using chi-square tests.  
• Analysis of distribution of test performance by [CONTACT_654] (yearly interval, 45 -49) using chi -square tests.  
• Analysis of test performance by [CONTACT_729931] -square tests.  
• Analysis of test performance by [CONTACT_729932] (including those w ith no polyps). This 
model will be repeated to include gender, race, and age. Modeling will be regression -based.  
• Analysis of Sensitivity to Advance Adenoma (Clopper -Pearson Exact confidence interval). Due to 
the expected low frequency of Advanced Adenoma, subgroup (Category 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) 
analysis will not be performed , but observed rates will be reported .  
• Analysis of Specificity inclusive and exclusive of non -advanced neoplasia (Categories 3.0 -5.0) 
(Clopper -Pearson Exact confidence interval).  
12.4.1  Additio nal Analysis  
• NPV, PPV, Odds Ratio, NLR, PLR and diagnostic yield for the 45 -49 age group will be estimated 
using the observed study specificity and different assumptions regarding prevalence of CRC/AA 
and assumptions regarding sensitivity to CRC/AA.  
12.[ADDRESS_996996] (Cologuard)  outcome and CRC/AA occurrence will be imputed using other available 
observed study data.  Based  on exclusion patterns, demographic data such as age, gender, race, and 
ethnicity will be considered for imputing missing data.   Detailed imputation methods to be used will be 
documented in the SAP.   The method of Campbell, Pennello, and Yue will be used t o assess the impact 
of missing cases  [10]. 
12.6 General Statistical Methods  
All tables, listings and figures will be produced using  SAS version 9.2 (or higher) .  Data analysis will be 
performed using  SAS:  Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.2 and JMP Version 9.0.3 or higher, both from 
SAS Institute, Cary, and NC ).  The  testing results from all sites will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_729915].

 12.6.1  Categorical Variables  
Categorical variables will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_729933] -sided 95% confidence interval (CI), unless otherwise noted.  When calculating 
percentages, the denominator will be the number of participants in the entire study pop ulation, unless 
otherwise specified in the output.  Comparisons across Categorical Subgroups will be performed using 
Chi-Square tests.  
12.6.2  Continuous Variables  
Continuous variables will be summarized using n (sample size), mean, SD, minimum and maximum 
values, and 95% confidence interval unless otherwise noted. Continuous variable data distributions will 
be evaluated for Normality using Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk method using 99% confidence level  method.  Distribution -
free descriptive statistics (e.g. median value) would be d ocumented if the Normality test fails.  
12.6.3  Determination of Diagnostic Accuracy  
These data will be presented in the form of 2 x 2 tables, which will be presented separately for colorectal 
cancer (CRC), Advanced adenoma (AA), and advanced colorectal neoplasia ( CRC+AA).  Point estimates 
of sensitivity and specificity, along with  Clopper -Pearson  confidence intervals will be used to assess 
performance against study endpoint.  
Results of study will be displayed in 2x2 tables (for CRC, AA, and combined) as shown below:

audits performed by [CONTACT_116445], or companies working with or on behalf of Exact Sciences, and/or to 
inspection by [CONTACT_4708].  
It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are avail able during the monitoring 
visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
   
Document  Type:  
Master Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_996998](s).  
Any deviations from this protocol must be reported  to the Sponsor and documented properly. Protocol 
deviations must also be reported to the IRB/EC per IRB/EC policy.  
14.[ADDRESS_996999] Access to Source Data/Documents  
The Investigator’s institutions must permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulato ry 
inspection(s) by [CONTACT_20618]/documents. This can include Electronic Medical 
Records (EMR) systems and/or original paper records.  
14.3 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be und erstood to refer to either a 
paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this 
study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each enrolled  subject.  The completed original CRFs are 
the sole propert y of Exact Sciences and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except 
for authorized representatives of Exact Sciences or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written 
permission from Exact Sciences.  
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs, any other data collection forms and source documents, ensuring 
that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely 
(contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_729934].  Any corrections to entries made in the 
CRFs or source documents must be dated, ini tialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure 
the original entry.  
14.4 Records Retention  
The ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance defines source documents as, "Original 
documents, data, and records (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clin ical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_12607], 
microfic hes, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept 
at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial)."  
To enable evaluations and/or audits by [CONTACT_30962] a uthorities or Exact Sciences, the Investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, 
e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_729916], serious 
adverse event forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate 
documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The

23 Protocol 2018 -10 v2.0  
 Investigator or Sponsor shall maintai n study records for a period of 2 years after the latter of the following 
three dates: the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed, the date that the records are 
no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket approval applicat ion or a notice of completion 
of a product development protocol, or date provided in applicable national law.  
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required 
period (e.g., retired, relocation), Exact S ciences should be prospectively notified.  The study records must 
be transferred to an appropriately qualified designee acceptable to Exact Sciences, such as another 
Investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by [CONTACT_729935].  The 
Investigator must obtain Exact Sciences’ written permission before disposing of any records, even if 
retention requirements have been met.  
[ADDRESS_997000] (Cologuard) are similar to th e risks associated with any in vitro 
diagnostic (IVD) assay performed on stool samples. Stool s ample collection is performed by [CONTACT_729936]/her home . It is not anticipated that this collection process will present any significant  risk to the 
subject . The mt -sDNA test (Cologuard) results will not be provided to the investigator or the subject. 
However, m inor risks may be associated with use of the collection kit, as detailed in Section 11. 
15.1.[ADDRESS_997001] ( Cologuard ) 
will not be used in the subject’s  clinical management and both the subject and the Investigator  will remain 
blinded to the results. Only the colonoscopy procedure results will be used for diag nosis and treatment as 
per the standard of care for the average risk study population.    
15.[ADDRESS_997002] (IRB) / Ethics Committee (EC)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol 
amen dments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., recruitment advertisements, if 
applicable, from the IRB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the Investigator 
File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be forwarded t o Exact Sciences or designee.  
15.[ADDRESS_997003] of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the general 
principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involvi ng Human

The Investigator must ensure that each study subject, or his/her legally acceptable representative, is fully 
informed about the nature and objectives of the study a nd possible risks associated with participation.  
The Investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_737], will obtain written informed consent from 
each subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative before any study -specific activity is 
performed.  The Investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent form.  
15.5 Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or GCP  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (i.e., clinical hold) by [CONTACT_729937] e National Authority 
in any area of the world, or if the Investigator is aware of any new information which might influence the 
evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Exact Sciences should be informed 
immediately.  
[ADDRESS_997006] completed required study procedures with complete data

Bowel preparation procedures and post -enrollment colonoscop y will be performed following the 
established standard of practice at each clinical site.  Results of the colonoscopy examination will be 
collected.  
The quality of the colonoscopy bowel prep must be documented after washing/suctioning as follows:  
• Excellen t - minimal fecal residue and liquid, small volume of liquid easily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831], <5% of 
colonic surface covered;  
• Good - small amounts of fecal residue, volume of clear liquid covering 5 -25% of surface, easily 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831];  
• Fair - moderate amounts of fecal resid ue; stool limited examination but >90% could be examined; 
or 
• Poor - large amounts of stool, <90% of surface could be examined.  
Subjects with negative colonoscopy results and a poor bowel preparation will not be included in endpoint 
analyses.  
Cecal intubati on must be documented with photographic evidence and/or documentation of cecal 
intubation.  Subjects with a negative colonoscopy will not be included in endpoint analyses if no 
documentation of cecal intubation is present.  
For all subjects with histopathol ogical findings of CRC (Category 1.0) or precursor lesions (Category 2.0), 
neither the quality of bowel preparation nor documentation of cecal intubation need to be present for the 
subject to be included in endpoint analyses.

 APPENDIX 4.0 – GUIDELINES FOR PATHOLOGY REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION  
Sites must acquire and maintain reports of the histopathologic interpretation of endoscopic biopsies, 
polypectomy specimens, and excisional surgical pathology specimens, which should be available on all 
CRC s and precursor lesions (Category 2.0, inclusive).  
Histopathology results will be collected on any excised or biopsied lesion. Lesion location within the colon 
(site), size ( mm), will be recorded in the pathology report for all CRC’s and precursor lesions.  Table 1 
provides codes for lesion locations.  
Table 1 : Index Lesion Location: Use reported location or insertion depth in cm.  
P = Proximal Colon:   cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, 
right colon NOS, [Insertion Dept h >60 cm]  
D = Distal Colon:   descending colon, sigmoid colon, recto -sigmoid colon, left colon NOS, [Insertion 
Depth = 16 – 60 cm (inclusive)]  
R = Rectal:  Rectum, [Insertion Depth = 0 -15 cm (inclusive)]  
Lesions are also be categorized for study based on h istopathologic diagnosis of the most clinically 
significant lesion (Index Lesion).  Table 2 provides the listing of categories that will be used when 
assessing and determining final categorization of index lesions:

Adenoma with HGD/CIS, any size  2.1 
Adenoma with villous growth pattern (≥ 25%), any size  2.2 
Adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size  2.3 
Serrated lesion, ≥ 10 mm in size (SSA/SSP/HP)  2.4 
Adenoma, non -advanced, >5.0, <10mm in size, 1 or 2 adenomas  3.0 
Adenomas, non -advanced, < 10 mm in size, ≥ 3 adenomas  4.0 
Adenoma, non -advanced, < 5 mm in size, 1 or 2 adenomas  5.0

Subjects will be categorized for this study into a single category (1.0 – 6.0) based on the most clinically 
significant lesion present (Index Lesion).  For this study, the hierarchy of clinical significance in 
descending order of significance is 1.0 (highe st clinical significance), then 2.1; 2.2; 2.3; 2.4; 3.0; 4.0; 5.0;

A subject with CRC will be classified as CRC category (1.0), regardless of the presence of any other 
dysplastic or neoplastic lesions.  
Subjects with pathologically confirmed non -advanced adenoma(s) but without CRC (1.0) or precursor 
lesions (Category 2.0 inclusive) will be classified into category 3.0, 4.[ADDRESS_997011] of the non -advanced adenoma will be the index lesion for the case. In the 
case of subjects with both small (<10 mm) non -advanced adenomas and h yperplastic polyps < [ADDRESS_997012] CRC (1.0), precursor lesions (Category 2.0 inclusive) or non - advanced 
adenomas ( Categories 3.0 -5.0) will be classified as negative (6.0). Category 6.0 includes subjects with 
any number of hyperplastic polyps <10mm and any non -neoplastic finding including evidence of active or 
chronic IBD, non -colorectal epi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (e.g. carc inoid, lipoma). In cases with hyperplastic 
polyp(s) < [ADDRESS_997013] “no index lesion” or will have had no pathology submitted.  
In addition TNM stage and overall AJCC CRC Stage (I -IV) will be recorded for all CRC’s. Staging System 
to be used for Index Lesions categorized as Category (1) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) Definitions 
(Adapted from NCCN Guidelines and AJCC Cancer Staging Sy stem, 7th edition). Tis (CIS, intramucosal 
carcinoma) categorized as Category 2.  Table 4 defines the TNM staging for cancers.

The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
9 1. Introduction  
This research study funded by [CONTACT_92434], is a Phase III randomized controlled trial ( RCT), which  aims to 
provide evidence for changing policy or standard of ca re. The context of this trial is an unacceptable rate 
of poor long -term outcomes of preterm infants born as Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns 
(ELGAN ) <1000 g birthweight ( BW), but especially for those born between 23 -26 weeks’ gestational age 
(GA). Su ch infants are the most vulnerable and immature in all organ systems, including the lungs and 
the brain. These infants are at high risk of death and bronchopulmonary dy splasia ( BPD ) during their 
initial  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], neurodevelopmental impairment ( NDI) and pulmonary problems in infancy and 
childhood.  
The SAIL trial focuses on facilitating the difficult transition of these most vulnerable infants from a liquid 
filled in-utero lung to an ex -utero air-filled lung. Sustained Inflation (SI) is a promising de livery room (DR) 
intervention, with evidence of short -term efficacy with minimal risk of additional harm beyond current 
standard accepted Newborn Resuscitation Programme (NRP) Guidelines. This protocol proposes a fully 
informed consenting procedure. We propose  to evaluate the impact of a SI in the DR on the need for 
mechanical ventilation in the first week of life which would also impact mortality rates and the incidence 
and severity of BPD.  
1.1. Background  
Extreme prematurity makes the transition from intra -uterine life to extra- uterine life more difficult. 
During this transition - termed the ‘Golden Hour’ – the newborn must generate the critical opening 
pressure to aerate her/his lungs, remove the amniotic fluid and lung liquid to fill the lung with air to enable extra -uterine life. This requires an enormous physiological change and energy cost. Normally, 
high ambient oxygen, cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cold and other external stimuli will trigger breathing. However, the 
ELGAN infant has a compliant chest wall prone to co llapse and weak respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458], and cannot 
cope with the high work of breathing. This work is increased in the presence of retained amniotic  liquid. Most ELGANs are born by [CONTACT_27312], often without adequate labor. This retards the activation of  
the sodium channels (ENaCs), that switch the lung from a Na secreting to a sodium absorbing state, ensuring residual lung water.  
We know that establishing uniform aeration also called an ‘open lung’ prevents lung injury .(1)  
Performing this well in the DR provides the best start to the critical first days of life. Yet the best manner 
to achieve this is poorly studied. In this trial we compare two alternative methods that have both 
received a n AAP  ILCOR -2010 endorsement. Positive -end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] ( PEEP ) is now routinely 
used in the DR to establish and maintain functional residual capacity ( FRC)  and its use is well supported 
by [CONTACT_33653]. There is some weak evidence that an alternative method, SI m ay help. Indeed  in many parts of 
Europe the practice of SI has become a standard approach ( Appendix  1
) – Letters from Ulm [LOCATION_013] 
and Leiden Netherlands ). However, a lack of high quality evidence and uncertainty about its safety make 
the current creep into more general p ractice , problematic.  
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
[ADDRESS_1144504] lung aeration:  the initial delivery 
of PEEP alone; or PEEP supplemented by [INVESTIGATOR_765354]. The  combined primary outcome,  BPD or death at [ADDRESS_1144505] (ORT).1  The SAIL  trial addresses two unanswered, but important questions:  
Firstly , “In preterms 23 -26 weeks (GA) who require resuscitation and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_825305], 
which of two alternative s trategies to achieve lung aeration results in the lowest rate of death or BPD at 
36 corrected weeks of age?”  
Secondly , “In preterms 23 -26 weeks (GA) who require resuscitation and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_825306], what are the safety profiles of [ADDRESS_1144506] to achieve lung aeration?”  
In addition to this primary outcome, we will describe several clinically relevant and/or physiologically 
relevant secondary outcomes, including: FiO 2, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], surfactant use, radiographic ev idence 
of RDS, % of infants ever intubated, h ead ultrasound, duration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]; respi[INVESTIGATOR_195930] (FIO [ADDRESS_1144507] pressure ).  
There are two defined ancilliary studies that will be conducted  within the trial . At one site (Ulm) we will 
have niroscopy brain recordings, and  at several  sites, we will obtain flow volume pressure records during 
and after SI in the DR.  
 Thousands of babies per year die or develop BPD in the US. BPD is a costly chronic childhood 
illness. In a study of heal th care expenditure among children, BPD ranked second for total 
payments of $ 2.4 billion  annually ( Appendix 2  - http://www.lung.org/lung -
disease/bronchopulmonary -dysplasia/ ). Survivors with BPD often suffer serious pulmonary 
and/or neurodevelopmental sequelae. While extremely -low birth -weight (<1000 g at birth) 
infants are at high risk of death or BPD, the most vulnerable are those born between 23 and 26 weeks’ GA. In this population, the rate of death or BPD was 68% in the recent SUPPORT  trial.
[ADDRESS_1144508] pressure (CPAP) for infants breathing 
spontaneously, and PEEP during intermittent positive p ressure ventilation in the DR. Both approaches 
help to establish and maintain FRC, which aerates the newborn lung. Several trials demonstrate that CPAP can be safely delivered in the DR, but do not reduce the incidence or severity of BPD.  
These have been taken into account in the design of this trial. At  the time of submission of the trial for 
peer -reviewed funding, the ILCOR -AAP 2010 statement (Appendix  3
) stated:   
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
11 “End -Expi[INVESTIGATOR_13955] : “There is no evidence to support or refute the use of CPAP in the  delivery 
room in the term  baby [CONTACT_825359][INVESTIGATOR_1506].” ( Page 1404 column 3). ILCOR  states earlier in this 
section, that in preterm babies the situation is different:  
“Although positive end –expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) has been shown to be beneficial and its use is routine 
during mechanical ventilation of neonates in intensive care units, there have been no studies specifically examining PEEP versus no PEEP when PPV is used during establishment of an FRC following birth. Nevertheless, PEEP is likely to  be beneficial and should be used if suitable equipment is available (Class 
IIb, LOE C). PEEP can easily be given with a flow -inflating bag or T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_825307], mechanical 
ventilation (Class IIb, LOE B). The most appropriate choice may be guided by [CONTACT_825360]”  (Page  1404 Column 2- 3). 
• After the meta -analysis contained in ( Appendix  4)  of pool ed results of the three main trials 
evaluating CPAP vs other approaches for such small infants in the DR –  it was clear the  point 
estimate favo rs CPAP.  
• As a result of these considerations, the standard of care at HUP ( Appendix 5)  has incorporated 
CPAP as the first line in the DR for these very small infants.  In synopsis , this adopted the view 
that: “ even for infants who eventually require intubation, there is no evidence of harm 
associated with starting CPAP in the delivery room .   
The approach of using PEEP -CPAP in the DR as an initial means of support has now  been widely adopted 
in the US .[ADDRESS_1144509] of care i n the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83828]  
(HUP) NICU, and a recent quality improvement project targeted successful DR -CPAP intervention.  
Finally to emphasize that our approach does not depart from current standards of care , three  very 
recent statements of the Committee on Fetus Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) point out:  
1. Using CPAP immediately after birth with subsequent selective surfactant administration should be 
considered as an alternative to routine intuba tion with prophylactic or early surfactant administration in 
preterm infants (Strong Recommendation) (Appendix 6 ) 
This message is reinforced in another recent statement:  
2. Preterm infants treated with early CPAP alone are not at increased risk of adverse out comes if treatment 
with surfactant is delayed or not given ( Level of Evidence: 1 ).  
3. Early initiation of CPAP may lead to a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and postnatal 
corticosteroid therapy (Level of Evidence: 1). (Appendix 7 ) 
Therefore th e use of CPAP in the DR for these infants should be considered a standard of care in North 
America and other developed parts of the world.  
We propose however, that a new approach to actively recruit lung capacity in the DR would reduce the 
need for mechan ical ventilation and further decrease morbidity and mortality in the most vulnerable 
preterms.  While the NRP guidelines are accepted as the standard routine resuscitation of premature 
infants, the NRP does not have a specific algorithm for extremely prema ture infants. The NRP algorithm 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
12 for term infants is adapted for the premature infant population. The SAIL study is in a unique position to 
offer a possible algorithm specifically designed for the ELGAN population. The NRP Committee has been 
extremely suppo rtive of this trial and wishes to see such a study performed to help guide its future 
advice.  
2. Study Objectives  
2.1. Hypotheses  
(i) Early lung recruitment with SI superimposed upon standard PEEP/CPAP in the DR will reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in the first seven days of life, and reduce nee d for surfactant use; and (ii) A  
policy of DR SI on standard PEEP/CPAP recruitment will confer better outcomes at [ADDRESS_1144510] -
menstrual age (PMA) than standard PEEP/CPAP.  
We will test these hypotheses in a mul ti-site randomized trial with the following specific aims:  
2.2. Specific Aims  
1) To determine in 600 infants born at 23 -26 weeks GA requiring respi[INVESTIGATOR_622912], which

endpoint of death or BPD (using a standardized oxygen reduction test) at 36 weeks PMA.  
2) To compare the rates of other important secondary outcomes such as:

4. Trial Conduct  
4.1. Identifying Potential Participants  
Research coordinators will evalu ate maternal admissions to the Labor and Delivery Unit at the clinical 
site to preliminarily assess eligibility based on estimated gestational age and maternal labor status.  
4.2. Consent  
A waiver or deferred consent approach was initially proposed but with IRB recommendations, a full 
antenatal consent procedure has been adopted. These are fully described in Section 8, ‘Research Ethics’.   
4.3. Study D esign  
This prospective multi -site, multi- national randomized intention -to-treat, t rial will randomize 600 infants 
into one of two arms:  
Group 1 : Standard of care –  DR PEEP/CPAP [ADDRESS_1144515]. 
Group 2: DR SI and standard PEEP -CPAP of 5- [ADDRESS_1144516].  
Although un- blinded intervention is necessary, bias is controlled by [CONTACT_825364] 36 weeks , neurodevelopment and an objective outcome of death. This blinded 36 week PMA 
assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_15098] (nurses, RTs, physicians) who did not look after that infant.   
Parents will not be blinded to the intervention and will be informed of the allocation after the infant has 
been admitted to the neonatal intensive unit.   
4.4. Study P opulation  
4.4.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
Infants who are born in partici pating NICUs (which do not use prophylactic surfactant) and who fulfill 
the following inclusion criteria are eligible for enrollment: (a) Gestational age (GA) at least [ADDRESS_1144517] obstetrical estimate; (b) requiring

determining if an infant is eligible is to be done simultaneously while performing the initial steps, 
such as:  
1) Placing the infant on the resuscitation trolley;  
2) Suction airway, open airway and proceed with CPAP;  
3) Wrap the infant in saran wrap/neo wrap for temperature stability;  
4) Assessment of heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266] ; and  
5) Placement of the pulse oximeter probe.  
All [ADDRESS_1144518] team.  This is con sistent 
with the NRP guidelines which allows up to 30 seconds to accomplish the initial steps and determine 
the need for PPV. This has been independently verified in several sites (Leiden; Ulm; Edmonton; and 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825317]).  
4.4.2.  Exclusion Criteria  
a. Considered non -viable by [CONTACT_63847]  
b. Refusal of antenatal informed consent   
c. Known major anomalies, pulmonary hypoplasia  
d. Mothers who are unable to consent for their medical care and who do not have a surrogat e 
guardian will not be approached for consent.  
4.4.3.  Trial Withdrawals  
It is anticipated that there will be a small number of infants who, because of acute clinical 
deterioration are treated according to the preference of their medical team rather than by [CONTACT_825365]. However, their outcomes will be measured and analyzed according to original allocation by [CONTACT_7586]- to-treat principles.  
4.4.4.  Randomization Criteria and Methods  
Consent:  
As the lead site, the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117757] (HUP) will provide the template for a study wide  consent approach.  This template  asks that each site approach the IRB with request for 
antenatal consent. We recogniz e that at some sites an approach will be made (or have already has 
been made) in requesting their re spective IRBs for deferred or waiver of consent for their particular 
institiution.    
This protocol  assumes the approach for antenatal consent as per the recommendations of the 
University of Pennsylvania’s IRB.   In those sites where antenatal consent is being sought, parents of 
potentially eligible infants from  23 +
0 to 26 + 6 GA who  may  conform  to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_29643] (either a research coordinator or the site investigator) in the antenatal pe riod in order to offer study participation.  
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
18 Randomization:  
A randomization schema will be develop ed centrally by [CONTACT_825366], 
and implemented at each clinical site using color- coded opaque sealed envelopes to ensure 
allocation concealment and proper and efficient randomization. Envelopes will be packaged and 
shipped to each study site.   
A permuted block randomization procedure will be used to formulate assignment lists in order to assure close to equal numbers of subj ects in each treatment group. Randomly permutated blocks 
with unequal block s of varying  sizes, and allocation ratio within each block of 1, will be used. The 
block sizes will be determined by [CONTACT_825367], or large, subject enrollment.  
We have chosen to stratify the randomization scheme by [CONTACT_68566], and gestational age (two strata 23 & 24 weeks versus 25 & 26 weeks). Stratifying on any more variables (such as gender) is not 
feasi ble with the potentially small enrollment numbers expected at some sites. We will perform a 
planned adjustment following the end of the trial to adjust for gender. Use of separate 
randomization schedules by [CONTACT_3725] (ie stratified by [CONTACT_82064], with each site hav ing the same allocation 
ratio of treatment groups) ensures comparability of the treatment groups with regard to the patient 
mix coming from the various sites in the trial. This assurance is important because the populations 
can differ widely with regard to  subject characteristics. Further, there may be subtle differences in 
the standard of care from site to site, despi[INVESTIGATOR_825318] a well -defined plan and 
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, stratification by [CONTACT_825368], as it is well know that mortality outcomes improve as the gestational age increases.  
While there are clearly subject -specific variables that will be observed and recorded before 
randomization that could be used for stratification, such as gender,  there are a number of problems 
with including more stratification variables. Of most concern, stratification by [CONTACT_825369] a fairly large chance of departure from the 
desired allocation ratio. Sin ce we are proposing a study with [ADDRESS_1144519] minor 
modifications of the below, all of which will be assessed for trial approval by [CONTACT_40972]. However we do make reference below  to “site clinical local practices”. If such minor variations in these 
will not affect the validity and integrity of the tral, they will be allowed.  
At all sites where  antenatal consent has been obtained, or in some sites where the local IRB has granted 
waiver, eligible infants (23
0-266 completed weeks GA) will be taken to a resuscitation trolley, placed in a 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
[ADDRESS_1144520] a SpO 2 probe attached to the right hand (NRP p.54 ).4 The infant’s airway will be 
cleared and the infant will be commenced on mask or nasal prong CPAP at [ADDRESS_1144521] s tatements from the Fetus and Newborn Committee of the AAP .5, 6  
(Appendix 7) Our NRP compliant approach  is attested to in several other ways, including the approval of 
the DSMB that includes [CONTACT_825417] (one of the co -founders of the AAP NRP program); the inclusion in 
our group of a NRP committee member (Dr . Ades from CHOP -HUP);  and consistency with the Quality 
Program initiatives of the DR processes in HUP. ( Appendix 8 ).For the trial, the time of birth has been set 
as final emergence of the infant from delivery. The time of cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_52455]. Finally, the time for the Study Intervention (see Figure 1 below) is measured from the point of the infant being placed on the resuscitation trolley (defined as time zero).  
Thereafter, a n infant with inadequate respi[INVESTIGATOR_825319]; or  is bradycardic defined 
as  HR<100 bpm and not rising (as labelled in the algorithm diagram: Figure 1) will be eligible for the SAIL 
trial.  Time in which to determine eligibility is 30 seconds, however an infant can declare himself/herself in less time.  The initial 30 seconds are congruent with NRP guidelines.  
Infants who are not eligible for the SAIL trial will be continued on CPAP, and all further resuscitative measures will be made according to local clinical protocols.  
For infants who are eligible fo r the SAIL trial, the randomization envelope will be opened, and the 
treatment allocation will be announced to the clinical team.  Thereafter, the protocol algorithm will be 
followed for babies who are randomized to the SI intervention.  Infants who are ra ndomized to the 
control arm will be treated according to local clinical protocols. (See 4.5.1 for more detail on the control 
arm infants).  
Regarding choice of pressures : “The primary measure of adequate initial ventilation is prompt 
improvement in heart ra te. Chest wall movement should be assessed if heart rate does not improve. The 
initial peak inflating pressures needed are variable and unpredictable and should be individualized to achieve an increase in heart rate or movement of the chest with each breath. Inflation pressure should 
be monitored; an initial inflation pressure of 20 cm H
2O may be effective, but 30 to 40 cm H 2O may be 
required in some term babies without spontaneous ventilation i f circumstances preclude the use of 
pressure monitoring, the minimal inflation required to achieve an increase  in heart rate should be used. ”   The choice of pressure is discussed further below  under section 4.5.2 .

include the provi sion of T-pi[INVESTIGATOR_825307]  (positive pressure) ventilation with peak pressures set 
initially at 20 cm H2O for 15 seconds, and if needed subsequently,  increased to peak pressure of 25 
H20 cm , or as local clinical practices allow . Corrections by [CONTACT_66243]. SOPA are to be applied as 
recommended by [CONTACT_825370]. These are discussed in fuller detail below under 4.5. 2. 
4.5.2.  Intervention  Arm Infants  
All respi[INVESTIGATOR_825320] T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_825321], 
nasopharyngeal tube (NPT) or a shortened endotracheal tube  placed as an NPT . The Mountain trial 
has report ed that there is no difference in interface . (Appendix 9) SI will be delivered via T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_825322], as this device has been shown to be the only one capable of effective delivery of CPAP 
and SI (Hussey SG 2004, Klingerberg C 2011).   
The choice of initial pressure for the SI is based on pathophysi ology, literature, local practice or other 
and available data. While animal studies suggest that inflation pressures as high as [ADDRESS_1144524] 
that when the lungs are partially aerated as a result of the infant’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266], pressures as low as [ADDRESS_1144525] reported that 67% of infants required 
25 cm and 8% received SI of 30 cm H 2O.13 SIs of 20 cm H 2O were adequate in 60% of infant in the 
other trial, while 40% of infants required [ADDRESS_1144526]  NRP procedures as described in the next paragraph (MR SOPA).  Decisions about adequacy of the SI will be based on infant’s response as judged by 
[CONTACT_825371], respi[INVESTIGATOR_825323]

During this period between Sis, a s per NRP recommendations, adjustments can be made to ensure 
no residual lack of seal or obstruction is impeding the infant, resuscitation will proceed according to the first  four  steps of the “MR. SOPA rule”. (i .e. Mask Readjustment; Suction airway; Open mouth.) 
In both the NRP algorithm as well as the SI algorithm, MR. SOPA is incorporated in the step outlined 
as “take corrective ventilation steps”.  Last, if the infant is eligible f or a second SI, the clinician will 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
[ADDRESS_1144527] patency and deliver the second SI with a pressure 5 cm higher than the initial 
pressure. This step is in accordance with the P step of MR. SOPA.  
The final ‘A’ in MR. SOPA stands for Airway. There will be rare situations where the clinician must respond with intubation immediately –  such infants will be also randomized into an SI or standard 
arm. While these infants data will be pooled, it will also be treated separately in a sub -group 
analysis.  At any point in the algorithm, if the  HR is < 60 and not increasing, PPV may be given with 
rate in accordance with NRP and peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_825324] .  Observation after a  15 second period will assess whether there is  an improving heart 
rate.  If the heart rate improves to >60, the algorithm will be resumed from the point of departure.  
Throughout the entire period,  cardiac compressions will start if HR remains < 60 despi[INVESTIGATOR_825325] >  [ADDRESS_1144528] s intubation. This decision point may be reached 
by 2 minutes or even before.   
The modified but NRP compatible procedures are shown for the SI arm in more detail in Figure 2 .

The potential risks of this maneuver are described in Section 8 and in the adverse event reporting 
section. The main risk anticipated is the potential for a pneumothorax. However, we do note that not 
only has an excess risk not been seen in the available randomized data to date, but the pressures 
stipulated in the algorithm are within the ranges of those recommended by [CONTACT_825372]. The DCC will monitor carefully for potential excess risk, and some of the secondary objec tives are also part of the materials in adverse event reporting and will be transmitted at 
appropriate intervals to the DSMC.

24 4.5.3.  Data Collection for Non -eligible Infants  
To complete the patient flow description, this protocol addresses infants in the inclusio n GA who are 
not eligible to be randomized. By [CONTACT_825373]. We seek approval to capture limited data for this group of infants. There are two reasons 
for collecting this valuable information:  
• The de arth of information about DR practices in this birthweight range of infants  
• The known high potential for selection bias following the use o f antenatal consent 
procedures .17, 18    
Data Collection for these infants will not include any HIPPA protected priviliged information . We will 
be collecting the following information from parents who refused consent:  
Data Collection Topic  Specific Data Elements  
Delivery Room Data  Month/Year of birth; time of cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (recorded as mm:ss after 
birth) ; birth weight; Apgar score at 1 and 5 min; gender; NRP guidelines 
used in the resuscitation of the infant such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]; 
procedures if any (intubation, chest compression, administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]; surfactant delivery; UAC/UVC placement; chest tu be 
placement; final respi[INVESTIGATOR_825326]; and outcome of resuscitation.  
Maternal Data Form  gravid para status, exposure to antenatal steroids and type; maternal 
ethnicity/race;  antenatal corticosteroids (if yes, number of courses); any medications given to prolong pregnancy including tocolytics; diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy (insulin d ependent); placental 
abruption; chorioamnionitis; membranes rupture > 24 hours before 
delivery; mode of delivery  
 
4.5.4.  Training and Standardization of Research Intervention  
A training video has been produced for use in training the staff at all participating c linical sites. (It will 
also be translated into Italian; neither the Dutch nor German sites will need translation). The video 
will be used to train the research team about the protocol but also can be viewed when the team has been alerted that a potentially eligible SAIL baby [CONTACT_825374]. This video can be accessed 
from the SAIL Trial Website which will be created and maintained by [CONTACT_15791]. Should any university 
site deem this an unsafe site, the video will be sent as a file to the  respective hospit al site 
coordinator to load on appropriate computers. Should any university site deem this an unsafe site, 
the video will be sent  as a file  to the respective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825327] (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
25 To assess fidelity of the research inter vention across sites, a variety of methods will be used.  
• A main feature of our methods here hinge on the use of vide o recordings. V ideo capability 
during resuscitation for quality control purposes is available at UCSD, Calgary, Ulm, and 
Milan. A random sample of infants at each of these sites will be evaluated by [CONTACT_825375] 
(led by [CONTACT_825376]. Ades, Foglia, Posencheg , and  Nadkarni).   
• A training checklist will be generated for those who perform SI and will include simulation. 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_825328].  
4.6. Random A llocation in the D elivery R oom  
Following informed consent, the m echanics of the randomization maneuver in the DR  addresses the 
following aspects :  
• Twins and multiples will be randomized as a unit, using a single envelope.  
• Envelopes will be kept immediately outside the DR, at a safe designated site suitable for 
each  site.  
There will be between [ADDRESS_1144529] ion at one of these simulations  on the SAIL Trial 
website. O ur peocedure is modeled on those undertaken during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_825329] a member 
of our Steering Committee (P.Davis Melbourne) was a co -investigator. In addition [CONTACT_825418] was one 
of the site investigators for the COIN trial at McMaster University, Canada, where the process of 
randomization also did not impede safe practices in the DR.  
Thus opening  of the envelope will not impede appropriate delivery of care. All opened envelopes and 
assignments will be kept in the logs of the site. The research study coordinator will be available as a 
back -up for the clinical Neonatal DR delivery team.

5.1. Maintaining A dherence to A lgorithms and M inimizing Protocol D eviation s  
Extensive education and training will be undertaken to ensure technical proficiency and compliance with 
the protocol. A ‘boot -camp’ will be run at the start of the study by [CONTACT_825380] ( Peter 
Davis, Arjan tePas, Helmut Hummler, Anne A des, Vinay Nadkarni, Robert Berg , Aasma Chaudhary ). This 
will ‘certify’ the site PIs, who will then be in a position to train their own site -members. This training will 
be developed by [CONTACT_825381] -PIs and carried out locally by [CONTACT_358865]. A limited run -in period during

Site visits will be performed after [ADDRESS_1144541] been enrolled at each site, to examine site comfort and 
performance of  the SI, as well as records kept, and trial functioning. At each site , a single SI per 2 months 
will be video taped and reviewed at HUP  for reproducibility and consistency. In addition, experts in 
simulation – Anne Ades , Elizabeth Foglia and Aasma Chaudhary  will develop SI education .  
5.1.1.  Potential Confounders and S trategy to L imit Impact  
Severity of initial illness:   Randomization should achieve balance at baseline. Adjustment for SNAPPE 
scores on admission to the NICU will be performed during the analysis of the primary outcome.  
Site Variation :  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
General respi[INVESTIGATOR_825340] t in the DR and beyond:  Local unit protocols will be followed with 
respect to aspects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_825341]. In general, after initial resuscitation, CPAP will be the initial mode of respi[INVESTIGATOR_825342]. Intubation will be reserved for infants who remain apneic, are without adequate 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266], or have persistent bradycardia. Surfactant for RDS prophylaxis will not be given in 
the DR prior to SI (if so randomized) , even if the infant is intubated. Caffeine will be administered to 
infants if needed for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413].  
Extubation and intubation guidelines:   Continued need for mechanical ventilation is associated with 
BPD. We adopt a uniform guideline to intubation and extubation, though clinical circumstances may 
preclude strict adherence to guidelines at all times.  There is no consensus about weaning babies 
from mech anical ventilation. Therefore, the proposed extubation guidelines are based on consensus 
and criteria used in several current and recent large clinical trials. On a daily basis the infant will be 
assessed for ability to wean from ventilation. We will stron gly encourage extubation to be attempted 
within 24 hours after meeting all following criteria:  PCO
2 < 55 mm Hg and a pH >7.25, FiO 2 of < 0.4 
with an SpO 2 of > 88% or higher, mean airway pressure of  <  [ADDRESS_1144542] 48 hours . Reintubation will be at the discretion of the clinical team 
managing the infant.  
Demographic variables:   The next section describe s the  analytical plan to  examine the key covariates 
of gender, antenatal corticosteroids, multiples, and week of gestation .19

initial source for teaching sites and their staff, and on- going re -education .  
6. Statistical  Analysis  
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will be housed at the University of Pennslyvania and submitting a 
separate IRB approval request to the IRB. The DCC is comprised of four  parts: Biostatistics, Project 
Management, Data Management and Research Technology.  
Biostatistical support will provide centralized randomization, publication support, interim analyses and statistical analysis plans under the direction of Drs. Ratcliffe and Localio. Project management will coordinate activities betwee n the scientific and operations teams and manage sites. Data Management 
will include case report form (CRF) design, management and entry, data quality assurance and reporting. Information Systems will include database design and system support.  
6.1. Statistical  Plan 
6.1.1.  Sample Size Determination  
Sample size is based on a possible reduction in risk of neonatal mortality/BDP in infants at [ADDRESS_1144543] PEE P/CPAP. The 
significance level was set at α=0.038 (due to the interim analyses), and power at 80%. Based on 
information from the recent m ulti-center NICHD SUPPORT trial2 and the COIN trial,20 we estimate 
that the baseline rate of neonatal mortality/BDP in the standard or care (control) arm by 36 weeks is 
65%.  
In order to detect an absolute risk reduction of 12.5%, [ADDRESS_1144544] inflated the estimate by 1.12 to allow for twins and multiples to be randomized together. With this 
inflation in mind,  the target sample size for this study is 300 subjects per arm.  
For the secondary outcomes available in all subjects, with 263 subjects per arm (ignoring the twin 
correction factor), there will be 80% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_1144545] ratio of 0.77 in survival outcomes under a proportional hazards 
assumption.   Some secondary outcomes will not be available due to death of the infant, or loss to 
follow -up after discharge from the NICU. Overestim ating these rates at 50%, we assume [ADDRESS_1144546] 17% in event rates (or 
odds ratio of at least 2.0).  
6.1.2.  Methods  of Analysis  
The proposed study is a two -arm parallel design of two alternative courses of treatment. A 
conventional “as -randomized” analysis (or “intention -to-treat” analysis) will estimate whether the 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
[ADDRESS_1144547] weekly from the study database for analysis. Graphics will be prepared using 
Stata v11 (or later) (Stata Corp, San Antonio TX, 2009) and the R programming package (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2011). Analyses will be imp lemented in SAS.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Descriptive Statistics  
Although randomization at baseline should balance observed and unobserved differences between 
the treatment arms by [CONTACT_825382], extra precautions are needed to 
guard against the potential bias of baseline covariates with chance imbalance from finite sample sizes. Initial analysis will describe the distribution of data. We will characterize both treatment arms 
by [CONTACT_825383]. Means, standard deviations, medians, and 
ranges will be computed for measured continuous variables; marginal distributions will be used for categorical factors. Graphical methods including histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots, will be used 
in order to understand aspects of data qua lity and examine assumptions (such as normality) 
underlying statistical models.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis  of Primary Outcome  
The primary endpoint to be used for efficacy evaluation is the rate of Death or BPD at 36 weeks gestation age. The primary hypothesis to be tested i s that the treatment therapy results in a 
decreased event rate. Although a proportion’s test is used for sample size calculations, rates will be 
compared using logistic regression, which will allow for control of covariates, as well as investigation 
of eff ect modification. Potential covariates include gender, gestational age, initial heart rate, 
maternal corticosteriods use, and small for gestational age (SGA). Clinical site will be used as a 
stratifying factor to control for any confounding by [CONTACT_825384], site -level treatment 
imbalance. The logistic regression will be estimated using a  generalized estimating equation (GEE) in 
order to adjust for the inherent correlation expected with multiples . Standard regression diagnostics 
will be used to assess model adequacy, and to examine for potential outlying or influential data points.  
Prior studies offer no basis for assuming a priori interactions between treatment arms and subgroups defined by [CONTACT_4321], race/ethnicity, gestational age, site or a combination of these groups, 
beyond that already controlled for in the randomization. For that reason, preplanned tests for 
interactions with treatment assignment are not warranted, and not powered for. We propose , 
however, to table all results by [CONTACT_825385], solely for purposes of generating 
hypotheses for future studies.  In particular, there is interest i n exploring subgroups defined by:  
• Consenting procedure which may vary by [CONTACT_3725] (antenatal vs. deferred consent). While consenting procedure differences may result in some selection bias, this will be implicity adjusted for with 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
33 the already planned clinical  site stratification factor. Additionally, the sample size still results in 
80% power at α=0.038 for the primary outcome even if the selection bias results in a reduced 
control arm rate.  
• Route of treatment (facemask vs. nasopharyngeal tube ). While not expected to modify the 
intervention effectiveness, exploring this difference will be important for future study design and 
clinical practice.  
• Enrollment date. Clinical practices unrelated to this intervention, as well as increased intervention experience, could result in changes in the clinical effectiveness of the intervention 
over time (positively or negatively). We will explore graphically any temporal trends in the intervention effect, and will allow/test for a time -varying treatment effect via a functional logistic 
regression model, if needed (for which the original power calculations are cons ervative) .
21 
6.1.3.  Analysis of Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using similar procedures to the primary outcome. Comparisons 
between treatment arms will use logistic regression (dichotomous outcomes), linear regression 
(continuo us outcomes), or survival analysis (survival time outcomes), as appropriate.  
6.2. Interim Analysis  
Since neonatal safety is a consideration in this study, we have chosen to use a group sequential design. 
Thus, in addition to the final analysis, we are planning on performing two interim statistical analyses 
during the course of this study. The purpose of the interim analyses will be to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence of a difference between the treatment arms in the primary endpoint such 
that the trial should be discontinued prior to reaching the target accrual goal. The interim analyses will 
be performed after approximately 1/3 (200 subjects) and 2/3 (400 subjects) of the total required patients have completed their primary outcome.  An additional safety review will be undertaken after 
1/6 (100 subjects) have completed their primary outcome.  
The primary outcome for the interim analyses will be the comparison of death/BPD between the 
treatment arms. This comparison will be accomplished by [CONTACT_15276] a simple generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) model for death/BPD versus treatment (since adjustment for multiples will be needed). 
An approximate O’Brien -Fleming boundary will be used at each interim look to calculate the nominal 
significance level t o which  interim p -values are compared .
22 Using the O’Brien Fleming spending 
function, the three analyses (2 interim + final) should use the following incremental α values (0.0002, 
0.012, and 0.038) in order to achieve an  overall α=0.05.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724942]:  
(1) Clear superiority . Whether the experimental treatment is clearly inferior to standard therapy. For 
these calculations, we trade off the power to detect a difference and the size of that difference. Assuming α =0.[ADDRESS_1144548] a reduction from 65% in the conventional therapy to 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
34 32.5% in the experimental therapy, a 50% relative reduction. For the second interim analysis, using 
α=0.012, power with [ADDRESS_1144549] an absolute reduction from 65% to 
40% in the risk of d eath plus BPD. Thus, early or premature stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724943], without 
dramatic improvement from experimental treatment.  
(2) Inferiority.  Power is limited to identify inferiority of the experimental treatment, with 0.8 power to 
demonstrate a 15% point increase in the risk of outcome from 65% in the standard therapy to 80% in the 
intervention.  
(3) Futility.  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825343]. In the event that the intervention arm has equivalent 
BPD/death rates to the standard care arm, it would still be clinically useful to know if the intervention 
improves any of the secondary outcomes (that are closer to the time of the intervention) or decreases 
the serious adverse event rate.  
(4) Safety.  
(a) Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825344]- inferior efficacy must be based largely on descriptive 
data and close examination of adverse events. With [ADDRESS_1144550] 0.5 (risk of death and BPD) to have 
80% power to show non -inferior efficacy (with alpha = 0.012) .  
(b) To justify stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825345]- inferior efficacy and superior safety again will require a substantial 
observed improvement in the experimental arm at the second early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_220580].  
(c) Another safety outcome is the rate of pneumothorax, pulmo nary interstitial emphysema (PIE), 
and/or other serious adverse events (that have been adjudicated as potentially relating to the intervention; see section 8.2.2). In order to minimize the risk, this safety outcome will be compared 
between treatment arms a fter 1/6 (100 subjects) have completed the primary outcome, as well as at the 
two planned interim analyses for the primary outcome (1/3 and 2/3), since we would not expect any statistically significant differences in the rate after 100 subjects (with O’Bri en-Fleming  alpha 0.000002). 
Instead, we will look for a clinically meaningful double the risk in the intervention versus standard care arms.   
In summary, given the projected number of patients to be enrolled, early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825346].  
The results of the interim analyses will be judged by [CONTACT_6802]. This committee will act completely 
independently of the clinical  investigators, including the Principal Investigators.  However, the ultimate 
decision to stop the study will rest with the steering committee.  
Note: An adaptive design was not used for this study. The efficacy improvement was minor over the 
conventional de sign.

[ADDRESS_1144551] and d ata management support will be provided by [CONTACT_825386] (CRCU), and the staff statistician at Biostatistics Analysis Center (BAC). Both of these 
groups are under the direction  of Drs . Ratcliffe (co -PI), and Localio . Initial  stages of data management 
will be done by [CONTACT_825387] (CDMs), database developers, , supported by 
[CONTACT_825388], programmers, and information technology (IT) specialists. Th ese persons will 
be responsible for data quality and timeliness, documentation of processes and procedures, and training of data management staff.  
Every effort will be made to monitor data collection and entry and to correct errors, inconsistencies, ambig uities, and omissions in real time. Data will be entered directly into a secure, backed -up, 24 -hour, 
web -based database using electronic case report forms (CRFs) developed by [CONTACT_825389]. Data e ntry screens will incorporate range and logical 
edit checks, both within and across forms. Data entry will be followed daily with manual and 
programmed checks and edits for errors and omissions. A data monitoring plan written before the start 
of data colle ction will serve as a reference guide for the development of case report forms (paper and 
electronic versions), data handling conventions, reporting, data dictionaries, supporting meta data, as 
well as project closeout activities, communication and coordin ation plans among the PIs, clinical teams, 
sites coordinators, and staff and faculty -level statisticians.  
7.1. Data Security  
Access to direct identifiers will be limited to staff who meet all relevant training requirements and are assigned to (or support) this project, and who must have access to these identifiers for purposes of quality control and monitoring. All other persons, including statisticians and investigators will be blinded 
to identifiers until such time as for reasons of safety or clinical care, th ose identifiers must be shared. All 
investigators, statisticians, and staff will have completed the  HIPAA and  Human Subjects Protection 
training. All data with identifiers will be stored on firewall- protected secure servers.  
7.2. Data Sharing  
It is required of investigators at the  University of  Pennsylvania that research results generated under 
sponsorship by [CONTACT_825390] a timely manner. The 
primary method by [CONTACT_825391] -reviewed 
publications and presentation at meetings. In addition data and results created from NIH supported 
research will be submitted to NIH in the annual progress reports required under the terms and conditio ns of this award. This study will also be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.  
At the end of the study, limited access to the data may be granted  to investigators external to the 
project . Such requests must be authorized by [CONTACT_825392]. To 
facilitate requests, the DCC will provide fully annotated final analytic datasets used to support published results. Such files will not contain any information on hu man subjects that could be used for their 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
[ADDRESS_1144552] sharing of unpublished data may require a data sharing 
agreement, which will stipulate the conditions of their use.  
7.3. Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
A data mo nitoring safety committee (DSMC) will be established to: (1) protect all study patients, (2) 
safeguard the interests of all study patients, (3) monitor the overall conduct of the trial, (4) advise the investigators in order to protect the integrity of the trial, and (5) supervise the conduct and analysis of 
all interim analyses. To this end the DSMC will receive regular reports from the trial on any injuries or 
adverse events, any developments that jeopardize the continued success of the trial, and data by [CONTACT_825393] -determined early st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] .
23  All Serious Adverse Events will 
be sent within 72 hours to the DSMC; reports of adverse events and recruitment will be sent monthly; 
demographics will be included with the interim and fi nal safety and efficacy analyses.   
Two interim statistical analyses are planned during the course of this study . The primary endpoint to be 
used for efficacy and safety evaluation is the rate of Death or BPD at 36 weeks gestation age. The 
primary hypothesis to be tested is that the treatment therapy results in a decreased event rate.  A 
secondary safety outcome to be evaluated is the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) between the two groups. Interim analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_825394] , independently from the trial 
leadership. The results of the interimum analyses will be provided to the DSMC. Additionally, the code used to produce the analyses will be provided to the DSMC biostatistican for independent, secondary verification of the re sults.  
7.3.1.  Composition and Function of the DSMC  
This is a n investigator -initiated study sponsored by [CONTACT_825395]  (NICHD).  
The NICHD scientists (T. Raju and M. Willinger) will receive AEs and SAEs and assure that they are 
sent to the Chair of the DSMC .  [CONTACT_825419] will participate during the open segment of the DSMC 
meeting. [CONTACT_825420]  will sit on the DSMC, but will not be a voting member . In a ddition, [CONTACT_825419] 
(Chief, Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch, NICHD) retains close contacts with  investigators. but will 
not be a voting member.  
A DSMC  has been appointed to work closely with the NICHD using NIH operating rules. There are no 
conflicts of interest with these individuals, who are not research collaborators of, and are at separate 
institutions from the investigator s. 
The already named members of the DSMC  are: 
Chair:  [CONTACT_825421] of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati , whose primary  
focus is care of the newborn lung.  
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
37 Members:  
[CONTACT_825422] of Pediatrics , Division of Neonatology , 
University of Virginia, whose primary focus is evidence -based 
practice in neonatal resuscitation.  
[CONTACT_825423]  of the Biostatistics Center at  George Washington 
University, and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_825347] -Fetal Medicine (MFM) Network , 
whose biostatistical expertise is in the conduct of multi -center 
clinical trials.  
[CONTACT_825424] of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University 
School of Medicine , whose primary focus is ethics of neonatology 
research.  
[CONTACT_825425]  (Non -voting member) Pro gram Scientist/Medical Officer, is also 
appoint ed to the Board to e nsure co -oversight by [CONTACT_92434].  
All members of the DSMC are completely independent of the study and the PIs and will be required 
to sign documentation to this effect. The DSMC will conform to the recommended standards of the 
NIH ( http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127069.htm ). 
It will be the responsibility of the trial investigators to notify the IRB or IRBs involved of any issues 
that ar e rel evant  to patient safety or to early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660]. The executive committee will 
discuss with the DSMC how frequently to review sites at the start- up phase to ensure safety, consent 
and enrol lment. The DSMC will have at least one annual in -pers on meeting and teleconferences, as 
necessary, organized by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC).  
In brief the Committee will:  
• Review the research protocol, review model informed consent documents, and plans for data and safety monitoring, including all propo sed revisions;  
• Review methodology used to help maintain the confidentiality of the study data and the 
results of monitoring by [CONTACT_825396];  
• Monitor study design, procedures and events that w ill maximize the safety of the study 
participants and minimize the risks;  
• Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and 
timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 
performance of the study site(s), and other factors that may affect study outcome;  
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
38 • Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as 
scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the  
participants or the ethics of the studies;  
• Review serious adverse event documentation and safety reports and make recommendations regarding protection of the s afety of the study participants.  
The DSMC is fully empowered to require any other specific changes to the trial (pertaining to patient safety and trial feasibility issues) prior to any local IRB submissions and prior to any start to 
enrollment.  As is usual in such studies, the Steering Committee has the final responsibility for the 
trial and is the final seat of decisions.  
The DSMC deliberations will summarize topi[INVESTIGATOR_139431], recommendations made  and will be signed 
by [CONTACT_825397] . All participating sites and their site PIs will receive a sanitized summary of board 
recommendations, to be for warded to the IRB of each site.  
Any potential and actual Conflicts of Interest (COI) for board members will be reviewed and managed appropriately . 
8. Research Ethics  
8.1. Consent Options  
We will obtain an antenatal consent of parents of likely eligible infants 23 0-266 GA, who may be likely to 
conform to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this case a log will be maintained of all screened mothers -infants indicating who are eligible and which enrolled.  
We recognize that there are are serious personal burdens t o mothers, practical difficulites, and finally, 
serious scientific concerns arising from the antenatal consent process. These are summarized as follows:  
Firstly; t here is already an additional burden to distraught mothers who have been informed that they 
are at risk of preterm delivery. This is a difficult time to absorb the message that a possible 
randomization will be performed on their high -risk infant. Moreover, some of these these mothers may 
not even, in fact end up delivering an eligible baby. This is because threatened preterm delivery is an 
imprecise diagnose whereby [CONTACT_3450] 50% of mothers may not in fact deliver until after 26 +6/7 
weeks. Data for this is s hown in Rich W et al
17, 18, and we discuss its implication for selection bias in t he 
text below .  
Secondly, there is a limited time whereby [CONTACT_825398] a detailed analysis of administration of antenatal corticosteroids in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825348] y, which found the following:  
“Median time from presentation to delivery in those who received 1 dose (n=  85) 
was 7.96 hours (IQR, 4.1 -17.3). In those who did not receive A NCS (n=64), the 
median time from presentation to delivery was 1.27 hours (IQR, 0.53- 2.42; P 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
39 <.0001). Sixty -two percent of those who received only 1 dos ILCS delivered in < 12 
hours after the initial presentation. Of the 64 patients who did not receive A NCS, 
18.7% (n = 12 women), 21.8% (n = 14 women), 21.8% (n = 14 women), and 37.5% 
(n=24 women) delivered at <30 minutes, 30 -59 minutes, 60- 120 minutes, and 
>120 minutes after presentation, respectively. ”  In addition when comparing 
mothers who had two doses of ANCS to those who had none or only one dose, a 
dose response relationship is seen  such that the latter have a much higher 
proportion of infants < GA 30 weeks .24  
Finally, t here is a serious potential for selection bias of the antenatal consent process, as noted by [CONTACT_825399] 
W, et al.17, 18  This paper outlines  the major problems of generaliz abilty, and it is acknowledged by [CONTACT_825400] s has affected its findings .2  Nonetheless, after careful discussion 
with the IRB, we will adopt the full informed antenatal consent procedures. This is largely because of the 
uncertainty surrounding the currrent point estimates of potential risk. This is discussed in detai l below.  
8.1.1.  Consent Approach and Consent Form for  Families

The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
41 8.2. Risks of Study Participation 
The main  risk of this  maneuver is occurence of pneumothorax (air- leak) . [Pneumothorax is the most 
serious  of the spectrum of air -leaks. However we will also track Pulmonary interstitial Emphysmea (PIE) 
as potential complications (see section 9.2 .3)]. While this risk is described in relation to the experimental 
procedure (Sustained Inflation), it is also encou ntered as  a potential risk of any delivery room 
resuscitation . It is therefore explicitly acknowledged as a risk in the Newborn Resuscitation Program  
(NRP) teaching manual of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association 6TH 
Edition  2011; Editor J.Kattwinkel.4 [Page numbers in the next paragraph refer to this text] . It is rel evant 
that all care -givers  whether in the [LOCATION_003], Canada, Europe or Australia (where the SAIL recruiting sites are) 
are required to have successfully completed an NRP course or equivalent, in order to deliver care to these infants.  
The main predisposing etiological factor for pneumot horax is widely acknowledged to be the amount of 
airway pressure delivered to the lungs. As written in the NRP Guideline:  
“inadvertent high- inflating pressures being delivered to the patient  may result in a 
pneumothorax” p.82;  
“high pressure may be gener ated in the baby [CONTACT_825401] a pneumothorax or other 
air-leak” p.117;  
“Sufficient pressure to achieve a rise in heart rate and adequate ventilation should 
be provided, but excessive inflation pressure or too much CPAP can… create a 
pneumothorax” p.277.  
NRP  also therefore has to proffer a standard treatment for pneumothorax which is outlined in 
considerable depth.  
Accordingly, the NRP recommends that there be pressure limits on the degree of inflation to be used 
during resuscitation of these infants:  
“If po sitive pressure ventilation is required , use the lowest inflation pressure 
necessary to achieve an adequate response. An initial inflation pressure of [ADDRESS_1144553] preterm newborns… if you still not have any chest movement, you may need to increase the ventilating pressure cautiously..” 
p. 276.   
These suggested pressures are themselves a revision downwards from the original pressures stated by 
[CONTACT_825402] 2006.  
It is important therefore to note that the current NRP recomme nded range of peak pressure, is actually
 
no different from that being applied at the airway by [CONTACT_825403]. The first SI given is of a pressure of 20 cm H2O and the second is a pressure of 25 cm H2O.

Nonetheless, the point estimates for risk are based on insufficient data to enable a precise estimate. 
Therefore this risk is explictly discussed in the consent form.   
There may be unfor eseen risks that may accompany the presence/treatment for a pneumotho rax such 
oxygen desatur ation, hypotension, bradycardia.  These unforeseen risks are possible in standard of care 
NRP guidelines as well as the sustained inflation arm of the study.  
8.3. Data Confidentiality  
All named study PIs at the US sites, and their research coordinators are CITI certified in conduct of clinical trials, as a requirement of their participation in any study. We will encourage those at the 
international sites to do the same. The basic rights of study participants will be respected and 
maintain ed by [CONTACT_825404]. All data collection and processing procedures are designed to protect individual rights 
and to comply with all applicable laws and ethical principles including confidentiality. Among the rights 
that must be protected are:  
 the right to informed consent, which requires that prospective participants in a research project and, if needed, their family members, be provided adequate information abo ut the potential 
risks, benefits, and requirements of participation so that each can make an informed decision 
about participation  
 the right to decline, which requires that prospective participants be fully informed that their 
participation is completely v oluntary, that they may withdraw at any time, that access to 
adequate health care will be provided whether or not they participate in the research, and that they may refuse to answer any question  
 the right to privacy, which requires guarantees of confiden tiality of information and other 
specific protection as specified in the Privacy Act of 1974.  
The basic rights of study participants will be respected and maintained by [CONTACT_825405]. Our data collection and

between each center, DCC and the U.S. government that all research with human subjects will be 
conducted according to appropriate federal regulations and allows us to undertake its own Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) review and monito ring of research with human subjects. Each institution 
participating in the trial holds an FWA, which ensures that the institution’s human research activities, overseen by [CONTACT_825406], comply with the requirements set forth in [ADDRESS_1144557] to the approval of the IRBs at the participating clinical centers and the 
DCC. For this trial, the protocol, informed consent (IC), and other study documents used at each center 
must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_825407]. The 
IRBs monitor the research process to ensure that the procedures for protecting human subject rights are 
followed. Every protocol is reviewed by [CONTACT_825408]. Each IRB reviews S AE reports and 
approves all pro posed changes to a research protocol before any changes are implemented. If 
necessary, the IRBs will mandate changes needed to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects or 
suggest solutions for problems that arise during a project.  
After IRB approv al, infants eligible for the trial will be identified by [CONTACT_825409] [INVESTIGATOR_825349]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_825350] (1)  consent forms that have been specifically written to address the nature, 
duration, and purpose of the study; (2)  means by [CONTACT_825410]; (3)  possible benefit or lack 
of benefits; (4)  potential risks, hazards, and discomforts; and (5) possible alternative procedures. Spe cific 
decisions regarding the operational details of how consent will be sought (including the timing and the 
level of details presented regarding various aspects of the study) are made at the level of each clinical center under the guidelines of their loc al IRBs and practice policies and traditions.  
NICHD will defer to local IRB ruling for the conduct of the trial at all the clinical centers. Should a local 
IRB determine safety issues and require actions, including any related to suggested changes to the 
consent form, the local center research staff (investigator/coordinator) will notify the DCC, the NICHD Program Scientist . NICHD will direct the DCC in further action. Note that any changes to the protocol 
itself (directed either by [CONTACT_825411]) wi ll require discussion and approval by [CONTACT_825412]. The DCC will maintain all communications between the clinical center(s) and NICHD through resolution of all IRB issues .

occurs during the course of the clinical trial associated with the intervention, whether or not the event is  considered related to the treatment or clinically 
significant . A new illness, symptom, sign or clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality or worsening of a pre -existing condition or abnormality is considered 
an Adverse Event”.  
Adverse events will be mo nitored during the study to ensure timely detection of events that may 
affect safety or continued participation. In this trial, this extremely high -risk and fragile population 
will each experience expected and unexpected adverse events. Adverse events and their relationship to study, severity, time of experience, expectation, actions taken to resolve the event and final 
outcome will be recorded as documented in the medical record, or if reported by [CONTACT_527090]. These event rates will be part of reporting  the final results of the study  
and for the DSMC safety monitoring.  
Secondary outcomes of interest in this trial that can be compared across t he two treatment groups 
include: death; Bell Stage 2 -3 necrotizing enterocolitis; periven tricular leukomalacia or echodense 
lesions or ventriculomegaly; apnea mandating either caffeine or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]; 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia; retinopathy of prematurity requiring intervention; and each 
component of the primary outcome (available only  after the 22 to 26 month follow -up visit). Rates of 
these events, historically observed among similar extremely low gestation/birth weight infants, will 
be provided to the DSMC for comparison. Common, serious neonatal morbidities will also be 
collected. T hese include data on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825351], the incidence and severity of intraventricular 
hemorrhage, seizures, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its treatment, nosocomial sepsis (and organisms), hearing impairment, and pneumothorax.  
9.2.2.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
The serious adverse event (SAE) d efinitions are listed below. Based on the premature infant 
population studied, the SAE categories of events that result in congenital anomaly/birth defect or 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
46 require intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage ( devices) do not apply when 
defining events.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious  if in the review of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
Death of Subject  An event that results in the dea th of a subject.  
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken. This does not include an event that would have been 
fatal if it had occurred in a mo re severe form.  
Prolongation of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825352]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
Results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity  An adverse event that  may result in a substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal  life functions, i.e., the adverse 
event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, 
impairment, damage or disruption in the infants body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life.  
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medi cal or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious Outcome  An important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). An example of such events would be an 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment.  
Expedited Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
The sponsor NICHD will determine if individual serious adverse events a) meet the criteria for expedited reporting and b) ensure that they are promptly reported to the DSMC.  
Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is defined as a ny adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not listed in 
the study protocol, product inserts, or informed consent document.  
Attribution is the determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure . This will be determined by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_36749], according to the basis of the below 
classification:  
1) Definitely  
2) Probably  
3) Possibly  
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
47 4) Unlikely  
5) Unrelated  
9.2.3.  Clinical Events Defined  
The chart below shows the specific clinical events that are defined as serious for the SA IL Study and 
the reporting requirements established for the clinical sites:  
Adverse Event definitions:  Time Frame  
Oxygen requirement of Fi02 ≥ 40% for [ADDRESS_1144559] 10 
days of life  (report based only)  
Infant requiring > 30% Oxygen or mechanical support  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_825353] 28 
 
Serious Adverse Event definitions:  Time Frame  
Death  Within the first [ADDRESS_1144560] delivery  
 
Pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) 
and pneumopericardium. These will be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_825413]:  
         a) any chest tube in -situ post DR  
         b) need for new chest tube after arrival in NICU  Radiographic evidence within the  
first [ADDRESS_1144561] 10 
days of life  (report based only)  
 
9.2.4.  Unanticipated Problems  
An Unanticipated Problem  is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following  criteria:  
1) Is not expected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to (a) the research risks 
that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied; and 
2) Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3) Places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously know or recognized.  
9.2.5.  Adverse Event Management and Reporting  
If an adverse event meets any of the criteria listed above  of Serious, Unexpected and at least 
Possibl y Attributable to the study therapy or intervention, it will be reported by [CONTACT_825414] g site to the NICHD, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and the local IRB (per site specific 
The Sustained Aeration of  Infant Lungs (SAIL) Study  Version 2. 7_2017315  
48 IRB procedures) as a serious adverse event via the Medwatch Safety Reporting Form 3500A or a 
form that mimics it .  
Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event forms will be completed by [CONTACT_228540] (investigators 
and/or coordinators) for each reportable (as defined by [CONTACT_990] ) adverse event that infants may 
experience from the time of randomization through the predefined intervention and/or events 
monitoring peri od. Events will be documented by [CONTACT_825415] (CRF), 
reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_825416] (DMS) as instructed in the manual of proce dures .   
1. A preliminary SAE  alert must be submitted within [ADDRESS_1144562] knowledge  of the event.  
2. A more complete SAE report should be submitted (on Medwatch form 3500A or a similar 
form developed by [CONTACT_15791]) within [ADDRESS_1144563] at NICHD and/or th e DCC will determine whether expedited DSMC reviews are 
necessary. The DSMC can recommend further action and  the DCC will be  responsible for notification 
to the local site team and NICHD. NICHD may request the DCC notify required parties through 
establishe d communication mechanisms via technical memos.  
Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration will not be required for this trial as it involves no new 
drug or device intervention mandating an IND/IDE.  
10. Synopsis  
It is expected that trial completion in  [ADDRESS_1144564] has huge public health implications due to large burden from death and BPD in this 
population. The study intervention (SI) is poised to reduce this burden, and the trial would be at t he 
‘right time’, for a not -yet established therapy with promising pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. Moreover the potential benefits 
are lifelong, if the strategy is successful. In addition to the outstanding track record and expertise of the US based co -PIs, the overseas co -PIs are essential for successful trial completion. The key benefits of the 
foreign sites include content expertise in DR research and sustained inflation. Most of the animal and human data on this novel technique comes almost exclusively from Europe and Austr alia. Similar large 
scale RCTs (TIPP, CAP, PI[CONTACT_110586]) have been completed internationally. In addition PD is a member of ILCOR, 
confirming the critical importance of the question and guaranteeing translation to clinical practice. We 
submit that the involvement of all these highly committed international sites, but under US leadership, 
and in collaboration with the US sites –  can only further promote the currently high profile of neonatal

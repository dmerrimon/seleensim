Study Title:  A PHASE 1, OPEN -LABEL, SINGLE -DOSE, PARALLEL -GROUP STUDY 
TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF RENAL IMPAIRMENT ON THE 
PHARMACOKINETICS OF ELX -02 
Study Drug : ELX -02 [6'-(R)-Methyl -5-O-(5-amino -5,6-dideoxy -α-L-talofuranosyl) -
paromamine sulfate ] 
Study Phase and Type:  Phase 1 – Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Impaired Renal Function  
Objective s: Primary objective : 
To determine the effect of various severit ies of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of ELX -02 following a single subcutaneous (SC) dose 
in subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment . 
Secondary objective : 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single SC dose of ELX -02 in subjects 
with normal renal function, mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment . 
Study Design:  The study is a two -center, Phase 1, open -label, single -dose, one -period, four-
parallel -group, PK study in subjects with various  severities  of renal dysfunction 
and healthy volunteers.  
Subjects will be categorized in 4 groups:  
Group 1: subjects with mild renal impairment  
Group 2: subjects with moderate renal impairment  
Group 3: subjects with severe renal impairment  
Group 4 (control group): subje cts with normal renal function  
The mild (Group 1) and moderate (Group 2) patients with renal disease will be 
dosed first, in a parallel fashion. At this point, interim PK analyses will be 
performed and a safety committee composed of Sponsor and Contract Research 
Organization  (CRO ) members will jointly review the PK data before dosing the 
patients with severe renal disease (Group 3). Control subjects (Group 4) will be 
recruited after the recruitment of Groups 1 to 3 . 
Subjects:  It is targeted to enroll a pproximately 24 to 26  adult male or female subjects, 
≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age . Subjects with normal renal function will be non -
smoker while renally impaired (RI) subjects may be light smoker (no more than 
5 cigarettes/day or equivalent) or non -smoker.  
An effort will be made to carefully match the healthy subjects in the control 
group with the RI subjects by [CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), body mass index [ BMI ] (±15%), 
and gender, to the extent possible. Attempts will be made to enroll at least two 
subjects of each gend er in each group  and subjects with various  BMIs . A mean  
matching procedure will be performed. Six (6) subjects completing the study 
are targeted for each group of RI subjects  (Groups 1 to 3) and 6 to 8 subjects  
will be included in the control group (Group  4). 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after dosing, for 
reasons other than safety and tolerability, may be replaced in order to ensure a 
minimum of 6 completed subjects per group . The total number of subjects 
dosed (including potential replacement subjects) will remain within a maximum 
of 8 subjects per group and within a maximum of 32 subjects for the whole

Final 2.0  5. Introduction 
5.1 Background Information on ELX-021 
Eloxx Pharmaceuticals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_800081]-02 [6'-(R)-Methyl-5 -O-(5-amino-5,6 -dideoxy- α-L-
talofuranosyl)- paromamine sulfate], a small molecule, new chemical entity for SC 
a
dministration. The target indication for ELX-02 is the treatment of genetic diseases caused by 
[CONTACT_314254]. 
ELX-02 is a    eukaryotic ribosomal specific glycoside (ERSG) 
optimized as a translational read-through drug. Chemically, ELX-[ADDRESS_1103938] precursor blocks. Biologically, ELX-02 exhibits high selectivity towards the eukaryotic 
ribosome and decreased binding to mitochondrial and prokaryotic ribosomes. ELX-02 induces 
high read-through activity leading to the synthesis of functional proteins in models carrying 
nonsense mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (cystic fibrosis [CF]). 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1103939] been tested in in vitro cell models and in in vivo animal models. ELX-02 induced 
expression of functional proteins with pharmacodynamic and behavioral effects with a 
satisfactory window of safety in several cellular and animal models of genetic disease caused by 
[CONTACT_314254], including, CF, cystinosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 
mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), and Rett syndrome. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further preclinical data on ELX- 02 are available in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).1 

182023 (EL- 008) ELX- 02 200 mg/mL Solution for Injection FDA Eloxx Pharmaceuticals 
06-NOV-[ADDRESS_1103940]- in-human, randomized, double-blinded 
placebo-controlled single dose-escalating studies in healthy human subjects. These studies 
(combined) evaluated single doses of ELX-02 between 0.3 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg in 60 healthy 
subjects and characterized general and specialized safety parameters, and PK. In these studies, 
ELX-02 was generally well tolerated, showed typi[INVESTIGATOR_800082], and 
showed an acceptable safety profile without severe or serious drug-related AEs. A Phase 1b, 
randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled multiple dose-escalating study in healthy human 
subje
cts is ongoing. 
In total, 25/40 (62.5%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE after administration of ELX-02 and 
9/20 (45.0%) subjects after administration of placebo. The most frequently observed TEAEs 
were: injection site reaction, observed in 4/40 (10%) subjects after administration of ELX-02 and 
2/20 (10%) subjects after administration of placebo, and headache, observed in 4/40 (10%) 
subjects after administration of ELX-02 and 1/20 (5%) subjects after administration of placebo. 
Ototoxicity is a known complication associated with aminoglycoside use. Auditory function and 
vestibular function were assessed in the Phase 1a studies using a battery of tests.  An abnormal 
audiogram was reported in 1 out of 7 subjects, 7 days after administration of ELX-02 0.3  mg/kg 
IV. The AE was considered mild and not related to study drug by [CONTACT_800100] 106 after the administration of study drug. One out of 8 subjects, at a dose level of 
5 mg/kg showed a high frequency threshold shift on audiometry, and it remained unresolved on 
post-dose Day 58. There was no clinical impact, as there were no symptoms, and pure tone 
audiometry (normal speech frequencies) remained normal. This event was considered probably 
related to the study drug by [CONTACT_737], the Sponsor did not consider it related to the study 
drug based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_800083]. This event was considered to be an SAE by 
[CONTACT_737]. There were no abnormal auditory findings noted at a dose level of 7.5 mg/kg. In 
addition to these events, ear discomfort was reported in 3 subjects and ear pain was reported in 
3 subjects (7.1%, each): [ADDRESS_1103941] dose of 0.3 mg/kg and of 1 hour for the 
other doses. The elimination was rapid with mean terminal half-life (T1/2) ranging between 2  to 
4 hours for lower doses (0.3 to 5.0 mg/kg) whereas mean T 1/[ADDRESS_1103942] dose 
(about 8 hours for 7.5 mg/kg) as expected with the use of a non-compartmental model in a 
situation of multiple exponential elimination. The decline of plasma concentrations was 
monophasic at lowest doses whereas it was biphasic for doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg and 
multiphasic for dose of 7.5 mg/kg with concentrations longer quantifiable at higher doses. Mean 
residence time was about 3 to 4  hours and mean apparent body clearance about 6 L/h for all 
doses. Mean apparent volume of distribution was dose-dependent with values of about

Final 2.0  16.9-70.5 L for doses of 0.3 to 7.5 mg/kg. These data suggest a larger distribution with higher 
doses, not only
 restricted to extracellular fluids. The inter-subject variability on main plasma PK 
parameters (C max, AUC 0-inf, partial AUCs) was low with CV% ranging from 6.54 to 18.6% for 
Cmax and 7.64 to 18.2% for AUCs. 
Renal excretion accounted for a large part of the eliminated drug. Mean percent of ELX-[ADDRESS_1103943]-dose of collection was 85.2% for IV treatment and 
ranged from 81.1 to 99.2% for SC doses. For all SC doses, more than 78% of the administered 
drug was excreted within the [ADDRESS_1103944]-dosing. Mean renal clearance was about 4.8 L/h for 
IV treatment and ranged between 4.6 to 6.1 L/h for SC treatments. 
Further clinical data on ELX-02 from single dose studies are available in the IB.1 
Presently, there is one ongoing clinical study with ELX-02  (study EL-002). It is a Phase 1, 
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, third party open, multiple-dose escalation, 
single center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of subcutaneously administered 
ELX-[ADDRESS_1103945] 5 cohorts of 9 subjects each (both males and females need to be 
enrolled in each cohort, a significant number of female subjects need to be enrolled). Subjects 
will be randomized to receive multiple doses of ELX-02 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 in each 
cohort. Six subjects in each cohort will receive ELX-02 and three will receive placebo. The 
cohorts are as follows: 
Cohort 1 – ELX-02, 0.1 mg/kg or placebo SC twice a week for a total of nine doses; 
Cohort 2 -
 ELX-02, 0.3 mg/kg or placebo SC twice a week for a total of nine doses;

doses; 
Cohort 5 -
 ELX-02, up to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/mL per injection) or placebo SC twice a week for a

doses;  
Cohort 7 - E
LX-02, up to 5.0 mg/kg or placebo SC twice a week for a total of nine doses. 
Dose esc
alation to the next cohort will not proceed until after the 14-day observation period for 
the previous cohort in order to allow for the detection of unanticipated delayed AEs. Changes to 
the planned dose may be made in any cohort, depending on available safety and PK data. The 
dose will not exceed 5.0 mg/kg. Additional cohorts of subjects may be considered to further 
establish the safety of ELX-02. 
As of the date of this protocol, the first [ADDRESS_1103946] been completed. The study remains 
blinded (except for one subject with AE of abnormal audiometry that was unblinded by [CONTACT_429]) and the available data are preliminary.

(i.e., mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, as compared to a control group with normal 
renal function) on the PK of ELX-02 after a single dose of 1 mg/kg. The study will also gather 
additional data on the safety and tolerability of ELX-02  in subjects with normal renal function, 
and preliminary safety and tolerability in RI subjects, by [CONTACT_118090], local reactions at the 
injection site, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory parameters.  This 
study should  allow the development of specific dosing recommendations across the entire 
spectrum of renal impairment . 
5.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection 
A single-dose study to evaluate the effects of renal impairment is appropriate if the drug and its 
active metabolites (if any) are expected to exhibit dose-linear and time-independent PK in RI 
individuals, and steady state PK can be predicted from single-dose data .4 ELX-02 showed dose-
exposure linearity in the range of 0.3  mg/kg to 7.5 mg/kg following single-dose administration. 
Based on pre-clinical data, the anticipated clinically efficacious doses range from 2.5 mg/kg to 
5.0 mg/kg, which are within the dose proportionality range.  At pharmacological doses, ELX-02  
shows no accumulation in plasma and a relatively low accumulation in the kidney and cochlear 
tissues.1 Based on these properties, a single-dose design is judged appropriate to assess the 
influence of renal impairment on the PK of ELX-02.

[IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Exposure 
ELX-02 is primarily eliminated via the kidney similar to what has been observed for other 
aminoglycosides. The main processes are glomerular filtration and subsequent reabsorption in 
the kidney. Aminoglycosides are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules in the kidney via megalin, a 
transmembrane endocytic receptor expressed in epi[INVESTIGATOR_800084]. In addition to megalin, other transporters expressed in the kidney (OCT2 and 
SGLT2) play a role in the reabsorption of aminoglycosides in the kidney.

following a single 1 mg/kg SC dose, the mean (N=6) C max was 3576 (± 502) ng/mL, the median 
Tmax was 1.0 (range 1.0-1.0) hours, and the mean AUC 0-12 was 13, 131 (± 1729) ng*h/mL. The 
half- life was 2.14 (± 2.14) hours, and clearance (CL/F) was 5.50 (± 0.349) L/h.1 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
5.2.3 Safety Measures to be Utilized during the Present Study 
 
 
The mild (Group  1) and moderate (Group 2) patients with renal disease will be dosed first, 
in a parallel fashion. At this point, a safety committee composed of Sponsor and CRO members 
will jointly review the PK data before dosing the patients with severe renal disease (Group 3). 
For the control group (Group 4) a mean matching procedure will be performed in order to match 
the healthy subjects in the control group with the RI subjects. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1103951] drugs are cleared by [CONTACT_800101]/or metabolism in the liver and/or small intestine. In patients with 
impaired renal function, the PK of a drug that is eliminated primarily by [CONTACT_800102]. The primary change

Final 2.0  resulting from renal impairment is a decrease in renal excretion of the drug or its metabolites, but 
changes in renal excretion of a drug may also occur. Renal impairment may also be associated 
with changes in absorption, plasma protein binding, transport and tissue distribution. Therefor e, 
the FDA recommends that PK be assessed in patients with renal impairment in order to provide 
proper dosing recommendations.

Final 2.0  6. Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To determine the effect of various severities of renal impairment on the PK of ELX-02  following 
a single SC dose in subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment. 
Secondary objective: 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single SC dose of ELX-02 in subjects with normal renal 
function, mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. 
7. Study Design 
The study is a two-center, Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, one-period, four-parallel-group, PK 
study in subjects with various severities  of renal dysfunction and healthy volunteers. 
The subjects enrolled in the study will be categorized in 4 groups according to the ir renal 
function (eGFR value calculated using the MDRD4 equation – refer to section 9.2): 
Group 1: subjects with mild renal impairment 
Group 2: subje
cts with moderate renal impairment 
Group 3: subje
cts with severe renal impairment 
Group 4 (c
ontrol group): subjects with normal renal function 
The mild (Group 1) and moderate (Group 2) patients with renal disease will be dosed first, in a 
parallel fashion. At this point, interim PK analyses will be performed and a safety committee 
composed of Sponsor and CRO members will jointly review the PK data.   
  
 
The safety committee will then authorize dosing in patients with severe renal disease (Group 3). 
Control subjects (Group 4) will be recruited after the recruitment of Groups 1 to 3 to facilitate

Each subject will receive a single SC dose of ELX-02 1 mg/kg on Day 1. They will remain as 
in-patient s at the clinical site under close surveillance by [CONTACT_800103] [ADDRESS_1103952] -dose and 
they will come back for a follow -up visit on Day 8  (±1 day). 
Serial blood and urine samples will be collected to quantify ELX-[ADDRESS_1103953] of the various severities of renal impairment (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment, as compared to a control group with normal renal function) on the PK of study drug. 
The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of ELX-02 in subjects with normal renal 
function and in RI subjects, by [CONTACT_118090], local reactions at the injection site, physical 
examination, vital signs, ECG, early markers of renal injury, and clinical laboratory parameters.

The study will be conducted jointly at inVentiv and the Division of Clinical Pharmacology of the 
University of Miami. Groups 1  to 3 study procedures will be conducted at the Division of 
Clinical Pharmacology of the University of Miami (identified as Site 01 ) and Group 4 study 
procedures will be conducted at inVentiv (identified as Site 02). Clinical procedures, data 
collection and evaluation will be performed as per applicable SOPs of the Division of Clinical 
Pharmacology of the University of Miami and inVentiv, as appropriate, unless specified 
otherwise. 
9.[ADDRESS_1103958] before participation to study-specific procedures. 
Screening procedures will include: demographic data, medical and medication histories, 
complete physical examination, body measurements, ECG (12-lead), vital signs (BP, HR, RR, 
OT), hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, HIV, hepatitis B and C tests, urinalysis, genetic 
testing for mitochondrial mutations, urine drug screen, alcohol test (breath or urine), urine 
pregnancy test, and urine cotinine test (for Group 4 only). 
Serum cystatin C will be measured at screening and cystatin GFR will be estimated for 
additional data analysis, only if needed. These values will have no impact on subject’s eligibility 
and categorization. 
For eligibility purposes, abnormal laboratory or vital signs results may be repeated once (subjects 
of Groups 1  to 3 may need more repeats to confirm stability) if abnormal result is observed at the 
initial reading. Moreover, abnormalities found in the ECG may need to be confirmed by [CONTACT_800106]. In the event that the participation of a subject in the study is delayed and some 
screening procedures had been performed outside the prescribed screening window, outdated 
screening procedures can be repeated. 
Subjects from Groups 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, and severe RI subjects) should be recruited prior to 
recruiting control group subjects in order to facilitate subjects' matching. 
Subjects of Groups 1 to 3 who do not qualify based on a reversible condition or mild inter-
current illness may be re-evaluated after further testing/examination or re-screened after the 
condition is resolved. 
9.2 Assessment of Renal Function for Eligibility and Categorization 
Renal function will be assessed at screening. Subjects will be classified in one of the 4 study 
groups according to their eGFR obtained from the MDRD4 study equation ( Table 2) based on

9.9.2 Urine Sample Collection and Processing 
Urine samples will be collected for quantitation of unchanged ELX-02 at the following time or 
time intervals: pre-dose (first void in the morning of Day 1), 0-3, [ADDRESS_1103967]-dose. Urine samples will be collected as follows: 
 At each void, all urine will be collected into a collection cup. The weight of each sample 
will be recorded and the volume of urine calculated assuming specific gravity of 1. 
 Subjects will be asked to void their bladder within 10 minutes before the end of each 
collection interval, so that each new interval begins with an empty bladder.  
 When a urine aliquot is needed at a specific timepoint for renal injury biomarkers and 
creatinine (pre-dose and at 12, 24, 36, and [ADDRESS_1103968]-dose), the aliquot will be 
withdrawn from the urine collection cup.  If a subject is unable to void at the specified 
timepoint, it will be duly recorded and renal injury biomarkers and creatinine will be 
analyzed in the subsequent urine sample. Residual urine will be used for pooling with 
other voids of the same collection interval. 
 All voids collected during a defined time interval will be pooled into one urine collection 
container. The sum of individual samples’ weights will be recorded.  Any urine voided by 
[CONTACT_796015] (within 10 minutes) of two intervals will be included in the 
earlier sample. Two aliquots will be taken in each pooled time interval container for PK 
analysis. 
 Thereafter, all urine collected in the intervals 0-3, 3-6, 6 -9, 9-12, 12 -18, 18-24 will be 
pooled together to withdraw a sample for the calculation of creatinine clearance. The sum 
of all samples’ weights will be recorded. Refer to section 9.10.8 .

Final 2.0  12.3 Statistical Analyses 
12.3.1 Statistical Analyses of Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
GFR estimated with serum creatinine concentrations and the MDRD4 equation will be used to 
classify subjects and this classification will serve for primary analyses. If applicable, GFR, PK, 
and statistical analyses estimated with serum cystatin C concentrations will be presented for 
supportive purposes. 
Individual and mean plasma concentration versus time curves will be presented for both linear 
and semi-log scales. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geometric means, standard deviation 
[SD], coefficient of variation [CV%], minimum [Min], maximum [Max], and median) of the 
plasma concentrations versus time will be presented as well for the PK parameters according to 
renal function groups included in the study (Mild, Moderate, Severe renal impairment, and 
Control). A graphical description of the relationship between renal function measures and PK 
will be presented. 
For plasma PK parameters, using GLM procedures in SAS, ANOVA will be performed on 
untransformed T max, Kel and T ½ el and on ln-transformed AUC 0-72, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max at 
the alpha level of 0.05 to compare groups (Mild, Moderate, Severe and Control). Factor 
incorporated in the model will include Group as a fixed effect. Inter-subject coefficient of 
variation will be estimated. The ratio of geometric  means (Mild/Control, Moderate/Control, 
Severe/Control) and 90% CI fo r the ratio of geometric means, based on least -squares means from 
the ANOVA of the ln -transformed data,  will be calculated for AUC 0-72, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and 
Cmax. Tmax will be analyzed nonparametrically with point estimates and 90% CIs for the median 
differences of T max between study groups (Mild -Control, Moderate -Control, Severe -Control).  
For urine PK parameters, using GLM procedures in SAS, ANOVA will be performed on ln-
transformed Ae 0-t and R max at the alpha level of 0.05 to compare groups (Mild, Moderate, Severe 
and Control). Factor incorporated in the model will include Group as a fixed effect. Inter-subject 
coefficient of variation will be estimated. The ratio of geometric means (Mild/Control, 
Moderate/Control, Severe/Control) and 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means, based on least -
squares means from the ANOVA  of the ln -transformed data, will be calculated for Ae 0-t and 
Rmax. 
Additional statistical analysis may be performed. 
In the event that renal impairment has a clinically relevant effect on ELX -02 PK , the relationship 
between renal function  and appropriate PK parameters for ELX -02 (e.g., CL/F, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, 
and C max) will be determined by a linear or non -linear regression.  
12.3.2 Safety and Tolerability Parameters and Analyses 
Demographic parameters will be summarized descriptively. 
Safety and tolerability to ELX -02 will be evaluated through the assessment of AEs (i.e., 
seriousness, severity, relationship to the study drug, outcome, duration, and management ), local 
reactions at the injection site, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, early markers of renal 
injury, and clinical laboratory parameters. TEAEs will be summarized descrip tively by [CONTACT_450541] ( Mild, Moderate, Severe renal impairment , and Control ) for all subjects who were

archived at each site , unless requested by [CONTACT_1034]. 
14. Regulatory Considerations and Quality Assurance 
14.1 Independent Ethics Committee Approval of Protocol and Other Study Documents 
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of 
the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s Brochure (if any) and 
any other written information provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the 
Investigators have obtained the IEC favourable written approvals for the above-mentioned study 
documents. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_800114] e
ntering the trial or prior to performing any study procedure. The original signed and 
dated ICF will be kept at the clinical site  and a copy will be given to the subject.  
In the event that the protocol is amended, the revised protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_670878], unless the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
trial. If a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must be 
obtained. The new versio n of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_6179], prior to subsequently 
obtaining each subject’s consent.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s representative must sign the protocol and its amendments (if any) 
before initiating the study. 
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to  submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the 
ICFs to regulatory authorities when necessary.  
14.[ADDRESS_1104001], U.S. applicable Code of 
Federal Regulations (title 21), and any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies. The study 
will also be conducted in compliance with the recommendations laid down in the most recent 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with the exception that registration of such Phase 1 trials 
in a publicly accessible database is not mandatory.

with written SOPs to ensure that the study will be conducted and data will be generated, 
recorded, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements. A rigorous QC program is applied to ensure accuracy of all data and reports. 
14.[ADDRESS_1104004] approval of a 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 
[ADDRESS_1104005] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study 
intervention. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by 
[CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if 
applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents 
no longer need to be retained.

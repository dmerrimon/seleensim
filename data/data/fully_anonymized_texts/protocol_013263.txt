1.  Protocol Title:  
Effects of Lavender Oil on Postoperative Pain, Sleep Quality and Mood.  
 
2.  Purpose of the S tudy :  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the integration of lavender essential oil in surgical 
patients during the perioperative and postoperative phase of care. The study will assess 
patients’ pain, sleep quality, and mood. The goal is to support that lavender oil will 
decrease pain scores and narcotic use, increase sleep quality, and decrease anxiety by

3.  Background & Significance :  
Essential oils have been formally documented in use since the time of the Egyptians. The 
Ebers Papyrus document notes Egyptians using franki ncense for different physical ailments 
[1]. In Greece Hippocrates used essential oils to fumigate the city of Athens to fight off the 
plague [1]. In medieval periods lavender essential oil was used for its antidepressive, 
anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesi c properties. Medieval Persian physicians made records 
of their treatment plans which included lavender for depression and pain for headaches 
[2,3]. With the invention of steam distillation to separate the essential oil from the plant  
Europe began to use oils in perfumes and for medicinal benefits in the 1500’s. Two 
physicians named Hieronymus and Brunschwig wrote one of the earliest printed books on 
the distillation and use of essential oils for medical benefits [4]. By [CONTACT_941] 19th century a French 
chemist Rene - Maurice Gattefosse was known for studying essential oils and their 
therapeutic benefits. His work and documentation led the way for the support of essential 
oil in medical ailments. Robert Tisserand in the early 1990s review ed the French chemists 
work and added to his research to help make essential oils more known to the public in 
present day [1].   
 
In recent years lavender has been studied on human subjects to tests its known reputation 
for sedative, anxiolytic, and analge sic properties. In one clinical trial oral administration of 
lavender was compared to Ativan 0.5mg for generalized anxiety disorder. The study 
supported that the oral lavender oil called Silexan was as effective as 0.5mg of Ativan in 
adults with generalize d anxiety disorder [5]. A second clinical trial analyzing sleep quality 
found that ischemic heart patients in the intensive care unit received better sleep with 100% 
lavender oil undiluted placed on a cotton ball within 20cm from the patient from the hours  of 
9pm-6am [6]. Two studies have used lavender oil through inhalation in the recovery room 
with an oxygen mask after surgery for pain control. The first study was patients after breast 
biopsy, the second was patients who just had laparoscopic adjustable g astric banding [7,8]. 
The study with the breast biopsy patients showed a higher satisfaction rate with pain. The 
patients undergoing laparoscopic banding also showed a higher rate of satisfaction with 
pain as well as decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_359449]. Furthermore one study used 
100% lavender oil undiluted on the skin of pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy as a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_359450]. The study showed a decrease use in 
Tylenol usage postoperatively [9].

Date 24 October 2017  2 4.  Desi gn & Procedures :  
Design  
Randomized study with control group and test group. Using a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio, 
the total of 6 0 pati ents (3 0 per arm) will be randomly assigned to control or treatment arm. 
The Statistical Investigator will generate the  randomization scheme and monitor the 
randomization process over the course of the trial. The study will use randomization with 
random permuted blocks.  The test group will receive 50% lavender oil diluted in fractionated 
coconut oil and the control group w ill have the current standard of care with no essential oil 
intervention  (coconut oil only) will be applied . Fractionated coconut oil is being used because 
it is colorless, odorless, does not stain clothing, and has a long shelf life. It also serves as a 
carrier oil for the essential oil to absorb into the skin instead of evaporating off the skin due 
to essential oils volatile nature.  
 
Study Procedure  
The lavender essential oil used will be from the company doTERRA. This essential oil 
company was chosen bec ause this company has a medical and science governing board 
made up of physicians, surgeons, chemists and pharmacists.  The oil is also third party tested 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert Pappas a trusted chemist in the essential oil community for purity and quality. 
Gas chr omatography and mass spectrometry are used to ensure purity and no unwanted 
substances are in the essential oil. doTERRA’s essential oils have also already been used 
in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359451]. doTERRA’s essential oils 
were diffused in the Vanderbilt ER at the nursing stations. After 3 months of diffusing staff 
felt less work related stress, less time feeling overwhelmed, and had more energy at work 
[13]. 
 
5.  Selection of Subjects : 
Potential subjects wi ll be selected from the clinic of [CONTACT_359463]. Subjects will be 
consented by [CONTACT_359460].  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
Women undergoing any form of breast reconstruction therapy  
Ages [ADDRESS_448463] a one night stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359452]:  
Sensitivity or allergy to coconut  
Use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_359453]:  asthma, eczema, allergy to flowers, smell disorders  
      Sensitivity to lavender oil or any of its ingredients  
      Pregnant women will be excluded from the study. During routine preoperative testing the          
      patient’s menstrual history or urine pregnancy test will be performed to identify any patient                  
      who is pregnant.      
 
6.  Subject Recruitment  & Compensation : 
Enrollment goal will be 60 subjects.  We anticipate enrolling 6 0 subjects over 6 months and 
anticipate the trial to be complete within 1 year. The subjects will not be compensated for the 
study.

Date 24 October 2017  3 7.  Consent Process  – see Section [ADDRESS_448464]’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent : 
 
9.  Study Interventions : 
After informed consent is obtained, exactly 4 drops of 50% lavender solution will be placed 
on the wrist over the radial artery. The patient will rub her wrists and hands together and then 
inhale and exhale slowly for one minute. This will occur thirty minutes before being taken to 
the opera ting room. The dilution of 50% was chosen after reviewing Robert Tisserand’s book 
on essential oil safety, consulting a local certified aromatherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], Cynthia Loving, and 
consulting [CONTACT_359464], executive vice president and chief medical officer of doT ERRA 
essential oils [10]. This percent dilution is recommended on skin and is not likely to cause 
irritation to the skin. Repeated insult patch skin testing from doTERRA has supported this 
dilution rate to be safe to the skin. Furthermore a previous study used 100 % lavender oil on 
children age 5 -12 undergoing tonsillectomy with no adverse reactions [9]. The first dose will 
be given thirty minutes prior to the operating room because it takes 20 minutes for lavender 
to be absorbed thought the skin and reach peak plasma levels [11,12].  
 
During surgery the patient will receive 4 drops of 50% solution lavender oil on the temple 
region over the temporal artery every 2 hours until completion of surgery. This will be applied 
by [CONTACT_108424]. If the temporal  region is not accessible the shoulders or feet will be 
alternate locations of application. When the patient arrives to the recovery room she will 
receive lavender oil through an oxygen mask. A 50 % solution will be used by [CONTACT_1299] 4 drops 
of the lavender solution on the mask and wipi[INVESTIGATOR_359454] a cotton ball. This 
delivery method will be used because this was used in a study from [LOCATION_001] University 
Medical Center studying postoperative pain and no adverse events occurred [7]. When the 
patie nt is on the post -operative floor she will receive 50 % lavender oil on the wrist every 4 
hours in the same manner as preoperatively from the hours of 6am to 9pm. Nightly (9pm -
6am), 8 drops of 50% lavender oil will be placed on the cotton ball situated wit hin 20cm of 
the patient. This method and concentration was chosen after reviewing a study in ischemic 
heart patients in the intensive care unit. The patients received lavender at bedside on a cotton 
ball and had statistically significant better sleep quali ty [6].   The control group will have 
coconut oil applied without any lavender oil  applied in the same sequence as listed above.  
This will ensure the same procedures are carried out under both arms.   
 
Blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oxygen s aturation will be monitored in the 
preoperative area before lavender is given and [ADDRESS_448465] 
amount of narcotic needed interop in both groups.   
 
In the recovery room after the patient is given lavender through the oxygen mask the same 
vital signs and pain score meas urement will be taken 15, 30, and 60 minutes from lavender 
application. In the control group on arrival to the recovery room the same data points will be

Date [ADDRESS_448466] -op.  A survey will be filled o ut daily.  
 
10. Risk/B enefit Assessment : 
The use of lavender essential oil could have potential  benefit s to the patient : 
o Main benefits include decreased pain, better sleep, and better mood.  
o Other benefits include relaxation, calming environment, pleasing aroma.  
 
Risks are minimal, but there is potential for some adverse events:  
o Possible side effects include skin irritation or coughing.  
 If skin irritation occurs, plain fractionated coconut oil will be applied to dilute the 
essential oil. Then a 4x4 cotton gauze will be used to wipe off the essential oil. The 
coconut oil will be applied a second time and then removed by a 4x4. Washing is not 
a recommend step because water will drive the essential oil into the skin further.  If 
there is still a reaction and t he patient is uncomfortable oral Benadryl will be given, 
25mg PO Q6hrs prn itching or skin irritation.   In the control arm, should the coconut 
oil irritate the skin it will be removed using a 4 x 4 cotton swab.   
 For coughing or any feeling of shortness of  breath or chest discomfort, lavender oil 
therapy will be stopped. Any lavender applied to the skin will be diluted with 
fractionated coconut oil as mentioned above.  
 For any serious, unexpected event, which occurs to any subject during this study the 
appro priate DUHS IRB Adverse Event notification will be completed, e -signed by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_359455] 5 days of notification of the reported event.  
 Any patient who does not want to participate in the study can decline at any time.  
 The patie nt’s demographics including name [CONTACT_359462].  
 
 
11. Costs to the Subject : 
Study intervention and Lavender Oil will be provided to subjects at no additional cost.  
Subjects and/or their regular insurance provider will be responsible for all procedures and 
tests considered standard of care for their condition.  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date 24 October 2017  5 12. Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations : 
Study Design/Endpoints:  The primary outcome will be a difference in pain scores between 
the 2 groups and/or decrease in narcotic use and /or increased patient satisfaction of pain 
control. Secondary outcomes are better sleep and decreased anxiety.  
 
Analytic Plan and Method: Differences in the change scores of pain in the two groups as well 
any other demographic and clinical continuous varia bles will be examined using t -test or 
Wilcoxon test, depending on whether the variables are normally or non -normally distributed 
respectively. The differences between the categorical variables will be examined using chi -
squared or Fisher’s exact test.  Ana lysis will be conducted under the intention to treat (ITT). 
Missing data will be imputed under multiple imputation methods. Differences in the outcomes 
while controlling for potential covariates (age,  etc) will be examined using linear regression. 
Signific ance of the tests will be assessed at alpha = 0.05. Analysis will be conducted using 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC.).  
 
Power and Sample Size Calculations:  A study called the effectiveness of lavender 
essence on sternotomy related pain intensity af ter coronary artery by[CONTACT_359461]. The study observed pain scores of 6.45 (SD: 2.23) 
and 4.11 (2.13) in the control and treatment groups respectively [14]. For 80% power at 
alpha = 0.05, with the above observed mea ns and standard deviations in the control and 
treatment groups, 15 subjects per group will be needed. Assuming about a 20% drop -out 
rate, the study would need 17 subjects per group.  
 
13. Data & Safety Monitoring :  
Data and safety monitoring will be reviewe d by a team of experts (a least 2 physicians will 
be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_359456]). 
Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be examined by [CONTACT_942]. 
We plan to have a review  of the safety data in a meeting when half the study subjects are 
recruited into the study. The committee will decide on the continuity of the trial after reviewing 
the SAEs while ensuring the safety of the patients.

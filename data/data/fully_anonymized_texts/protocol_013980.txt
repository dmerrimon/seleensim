Summary of Experiences to Date
Please provide a summary of scientific progress of the study and the experience of research participants, to 
date. This requirement is designed to allow for the investigator and the IRB to reassess the study’s risks and 
benefits in terms of developments in the field, changing practice patterns, and new IRB policies and 
procedures.
36 subjects participated who were 75.3 ± 7.5 years old and 44.4% male. Significant, dose dependent 
increases in processing and gait speed were observed with L-DOPA (450mg dose: processing speed factor 
score effect size [ES] = 0.41, p = 0.001; dual task gait speed ES = 0.43, p = 0.003). [11C]raclopride ∆BPND 
was significantly different from 0 in sensorimotor (t = -4.85, df = 24, p < 0.001) and associative striatum (t 
= -2.52, df 24, p = 0.019) but not in limbic striatum (t = 0.265, df = 24, p = 0.793). Depressive symptoms 
decreased significantly on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (ES = -0.4, p = 0.01). Drop-out rate 
was 8.3%, and nausea was the most frequently-reported side effect. By [CONTACT_121689], 
L-DOPA improved processing and gait speed in depressed older adults and significantly decreased 
[11C]raclopride binding in selected striatal subregions.

Lay Summary  of Proposed Research 
Lay Summary of Proposed Research
Individuals with Late Life Depression (LLD) often have cognitive problems, particularly problems with 
memory, attention, and problem solving, all of which contribute to antidepressant non-response. Our group 
and others have shown that decreased thinking speed is the central cause of functional problems in patients 
with LLD. Similarly, decreased walking speed is associated with depression and carries additional risk for 
falls, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death. Available evidence suggests that declining functionality in the brain's 
dopamine system contributes to age-related cognitive and motor slowing. The central hypothesis of this 
R61/R33 Phased Innovation Award is that by [CONTACT_121692], administration of carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) will improve depressive 
symptoms in older adults. 
This IRB protocol pertains to the R61 Phase of this grant proposal, and a separate IRB will be submitted 
subsequently for the R33 Phase. In the R61 Phase 60 adults aged > 60 years with (1) a DSM 5 depressive 
disorder, (2) significant depressive symptoms, (3) decreased thinking speed, and (4) decreased walking 
speed will receive [ADDRESS_136430] response to L-DOPA may provide useful information to guide differential 
therapeutics and develop personalized medicine for LLD.

clinically significant depressive symptoms  (2). LLD increases an  older  adult’s risk of disability  by 67-73% 
over 6 year follow up (26), causes  twice  the functional impairment compared to those without LLD  (27), 
increases mortality  in patients with heart disease,  and is associated  with  high rates  of completed suicide in  
individuals over 65 (28-29). LLD is highly recurrent, can become chronic (30), and is  often  difficult  to treat 
(31).Executive Dysfunction (ED) is common in patients with LLD, predicts poorer  acute  response to  
antidepressants, and is associated with higher relapse rates during the continuation phase (5,32-33). Among  
the executive functions disturbed in LLD, decreased processing speed has been called “the  core  cognitive 
deficit (8,34).” Processing  speed  mediates performance on measures of verbal reasoning, fluency, and 
knowledge (35), and measures of working memory primarily depend upon speed of processing (36). Decreased processing speed  has been repeatedly found in  patients with  LLD relative  to healthy controls (8) 
and mediates the effects of depression  and ED on daily functioning (7). The development  of decreased 
processing speed places older individuals on a trajectory of poor outcomes, including increased  risk of  
dementia (37), dependence in activities of daily  living (ADL) (38), and driving cessation (39). 
Less well recognized is the fact that depressed older adults also experience motor performance  deficits, 
including problems with coordination (14), slowed movement (15),  and difficulties  with balance and gait  
(16). Depressive symptoms lead to the development of decreased gait speed,  and slowed gait speed  leads  to 
incident depression in older adults (12-13).  Decreased gait  speed has been associated  with  a greater risk of 
falls (40-42), disability (14), admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (16,43), and all-cause as well as cardiovascular 
mortality (44-45).  While LLD and  decreased gait speed are each  independent  risk factors  for adverse health 
outcomes, their comorbidity synergistically  increases  mortality risk in  older adults (46).  For these reasons 
gait speed has  become  a fifth “vital sign”  to be monitored in older adults, and  it merits increased attention 
by [CONTACT_121693].Post-mortem experiments and in vivo neuroimaging studies have  shown that  aging is associated  with 
reduced dopamine levels,  decreased D1/D2 receptor  density,  and loss of dopamine  transporters (DAT) (17-
21). Mesolimbic dopaminergic tone modulates processing speed in both humans and animal  models (47),  
and decreased striatal dopamine transmission has been associated with  decreased motor speed  (48), 
deterioration in frontal functioning (23),  and impaired balance (49).  Cham et al (2008) examined gait speed 
and dopamine  metabolism in healthy  adults  aged 21-85 years, finding that lower  striatal DAT activity was  
associated with  decreased  gait speed and explained 23% of the variance in gait  after controlling for other 
factors (50). These age-associated  declines in dopaminergic functioning are  topographically distinct from  
the denervation pattern typi[INVESTIGATOR_121664]’s disease (PD), being observed diffusely across  the striatum 
rather than predominantly posterior  putaminal in location (51-3). While  subtle Parkinsonian-like  phenomena 
may be observed with normal aging,  the non-specific  slowing associated with  aging  is clinically  distinct 
from the signs and  symptoms of PD. Thus, the hypodopaminergic state associated with aging  and LLD has a 
distinct neurobiology  from PD  and appears to represent a parallel  pathway  to developi[INVESTIGATOR_121665].Pharmacologic augmentation of dopaminergic neurotransmission may ameliorate slowing and  treat  LLD.  
Studies in non-human primates  as well as older  adults with  and without PD suggest that  dopamine  receptor 
agonism improves  working  memory  (54), verbal fluency (55), problem-solving (56), and motor 
performance related  to ADLs (57).  Since slowed processing speed and gait  predict the  development of LLD 
Protocol Summary  Form
[ADDRESS_136432] report  improved 
depressive symptoms (particularly psychomotor retardation) with  levodopa (hereafter referred to as L-
DOPA) monotherapy or augmentation (58-61).  L-DOPA is the immediate precursor of  dopamine, is 
converted to  dopamine in presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminals, and enhances dopaminergic 
transmission in multiple brain regions.  L-DOPA has been reported to  relieve depressive symptoms  in new 
onset PD, improving symptoms in 90.3% of patients (N=31) and resulting  in a mean Hamilton Rating Scale 
for Depression  (HRSD) decrease of  11.7 points  in one study (62). Relatedly,  augmentation with 
methylphenidate, which  also increases  synaptic  dopamine levels,  was recently shown to  accelerate and 
enhance antidepressant response in depressed older adults (63).Despi[INVESTIGATOR_121666], negative studies of L-DOPA, stimulants, and  dopamine  agonists  as 
monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_121667]  (64). One reason for these 
heterogeneous results is the different diagnostic criteria and experimental  methodology used  in older 
studies, which makes their results difficult  to interpret. More importantly, no study examining dopamine 
augmentation as  a treatment for  depression  selected subjects based upon the presence of decreased 
processing and  gait speed. If the mechanism  by [CONTACT_121694],  then  including patients without slowing may contribute to negative 
results. By [CONTACT_121695], we believe it will be  possible to  
more clearly  demonstrate the efficacy of dopaminergic  agents  and contribute to the development of 
personalized medicine for LLD.Three types of interventions may be considered  to enhance dopaminergic  function and ameliorate  slowing: 
dopamine receptor agonists (e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_121668],  pramipexole, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122]), stimulants (methylphenidate and 
amphetamine derivatives), and dopamine precursors  such as L-DOPA.  Among these options, L-DOPA  
enhances dopaminergic  neurotransmission globally, including increasing vesicular  storage, enhancing 
release, and stimulating post-synaptic receptors.  In contrast, stimulants may not  increase  synaptic dopamine 
in individuals with diminished vesicular storage,  and dopamine  agonists may have reduced  effects in older 
patients having fewer post-synaptic receptors.  Moreover, a large literature shows beneficial  effects of L-
DOPA on cognitive  performance and gait  in patients with PD (65-67),  whereas the few available studies in 
elderly patients show minimal effects of  dopamine agonists (68-70) or stimulants (71) on cognition. L-
DOPA, especially at  lower doses, is a safe and  well-tolerated medication that  is difficult to  differentiate 
from placebo in terms of  side effects (72). In contrast, a black box warning for adverse  cardiac  effects exists 
for stimulants, and  even modest elevations in heart  rate and blood pressure may  significantly increase  
cardiac work  in older  patients.  Similarly, dopamine  agonists are associated  with  sleep attacks  and increased 
impulsive behavior.  For these reasons,  this proposal focuses on L-DOPA as  the safest,  most  promising 
pharmacologic agent for the treatment of slowing and LLD.This study  will elucidate  the neurobiology  of slowing and LLD, identify a  novel  therapeutic target for 
depression, and  contribute  to the development of personalized treatment  regimens  for LLD. The multimodal 
neuroimaging methods detailed in this application will provide information about the neurobiology of aging-associated slowing  and LLD at molecular,  structural, and functional levels  of analysis. These  data  will 
fill a crucial  gap in our knowledge regarding what are the physiologic and  functional consequences of 
dopamine depletion occurring across  the lifespan in individuals without PD. Results from this project also 
will allow us to evaluate a novel therapeutic approach to LLD, which could have large public health 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_136433] a large public health burden in terms 
of impaired functioning and increased morbidity and mortality, and this burden will only grow as the 
population ages. It is critical to develop treatments capable of altering the negative health trajectories 
associated with slowing in order to help older adults maintain independent functioning and live longer with 
an increased quality of life. Finally, while PET and MRI may prove critical to understand the neurobiology 
of slowing and LLD, their invasiveness and expense limit their roles in informing treatment decisions in 
clinical practice settings. For this reason we are also assessing the influence of genetic moderators such as 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) genotype on baseline dopamine 
functioning and response to L-DOPA. This may facilitate the identification of both high-risk individuals and 
those most likely to benefit from treatment interventions.

R61 Phase. 
Aim 1: To determine whether L-DOPA administration increases dopamine release. 
Hypothesis 1: 300mg L-DOPA will reduce [11C]-raclopride binding potential (BP) in the caudate and 
putamen.
Aim 2: To determine whether L-DOPA increases processing and gait speed in depressed older adults. 
Hypothesis 2: 150mg, 300mg, and 450mg L-DOPA will increase processing and gait speed, with greatest 
improvement occurring at the 450mg dosage level. 
Exploratory aims: To obtain information on the dosing and tolerability of L-DOPA in our patient population 
as well as identify PET and MRI biomarkers associated with slowing.

Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_136445], be administered the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES-D) and the
24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and have a SCID performed by a trained
rater. If a subject has a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Dysthymia, he/she will be 
informed of this and educated about the availability of treatments for depression. If a subject is not 
interested in depression treatment and/or prefers to begin with an experimental treatment for slowing and 
depression, he/she will be offered participation in the present study provided their HRSD < 25 and there is 
no suicidal ideation present. Severe MDD (i.e., HRSD ≥ 25) and/or the presence of significant suicide risk 
(e.g., suicidal ideation, clinician judgement that there is significant risk of suicide) are exclusions for this 
study.
Patients with Depression NOS will be educated that as yet, there are no FDA-approved treatments for their 
condition. Based on the extant data supporting the efficacy of antidepressants for MDD and Dysthymia, 
they will be informed that antidepressant treatment would be a very reasonable option for their condition. 
These potential subjects will be offered the option of being referred out for depression treatment, and it will 
be clarified that L-DOPA is not as yet a treatment for MDD. Thus, all potential participants in this study 
must state their preference not to be treated with a standard treatment for depression.
2. Participants signing informed consent will have documentation of vital signs, medical history (including
history of head injury, stroke, hypertension, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, other medical conditions, 
surgeries, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and current medications), physical exam, urine drug screen, CBC, chemistries 
and electrolytes, thyroid profile, vitamin B12 and folate levels, urine analysis, standing/supi[INVESTIGATOR_121674]/diastolic BP, and ECG.
3. Next, processing speed will be assessed using Digit Symbol test from the WAIS-III, the Trail Making
Test Part A, the Pattern Comparison Test, and the Letter Comparison Test. Previous research established 
that these tests were all reliable and valid (moderate to high loadings on the latent speed factor). Digit 
Symbol or Trails A will be used as a selection  criterion, with patients included in this study if they scored 
0.5 SD below the age-adjusted norms on Digit Symbol or Trails A. A latent factor (and subsequent factor 
score) will be extracted from the 3-test battery pre- and post-treatment and used as the main outcome in this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. By [CONTACT_121698] a latent factor and factor loadings we will utilize a more pure measure of 
processing speed for pre- post-testing than if we used the raw scores from an individual test or a sum total 
score from the three raw scores combined.
4. Patients’ gait will be assessed as walking speed in m/s on a 15’ walking course. Patients are  instructed to
walk at their usual or normal speed for a total of 27’ (starting and ending at a point 6 feet prior to and after 
the 15’ course to eliminate acceleration and deceleration effects). Two trials will be completed, and gait 
speed will be based on the average of [ADDRESS_136446] a gait speed < 1 m/s.

5. Subjects will return the following week to review the results of the above testing. If subjects continue to
be
 eligible for the study after review of their processing speed and gait speed, they will continue as below. 
Subjects who do not meet selection criteria after processing and gait speed measurement will be referred 
out.
MRI Scanning
6. Half of the total sample will  undergo neuroimaging (N=30 of total N=60). Subjects will undergo a pre-
treatment MRI and PET scan and a post-treatment MRI and PET scan (i.e., 2 total MRIs, 2 total PET scans, 
separated by [CONTACT_941] 3 week clinical trial). Subjects who do not meet imaging selection criteria or who do not 
wish to undergo scanning will be allowed to participate in the clinical trial portion of the study only. MRI 
and PET scanning may occur on the same day if this can be scheduled (MRI occurring first, followed by 
[CONTACT_60864]). However, due to the tightness of scheduling for these scanners, it is more likely that the MRI and 
PET scans will occur on different days--one day for MRI scan and one day for the PET scan. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_121675].
7. MRI of the brain will be acquired using a GE MR750 3.0T System. At the start of the session, a 3-Plane
localizer (scout) will be acquired to determine patient position. Subjects will then receive T1-weighted 3D 
SPGR (Spoiled Gradient Echo), T2 FLAIR, and EPI [CONTACT_15213]. Acquisition parameters for the EPI [INVESTIGATOR_121676]: TE/TR (ms) 20/2000; Flip Angle (deg) 72o; in-plane resolution (voxels) 112x112; slice thickness/gap 
(mm) 3/0; slices 41. 
8. For the MRI procedures, participants are instructed to lie as still as possible within the magnet.
The MRI scan is completed in one session, and lasts for a total of 60 minutes. All precautions and 
protections are given to the participant to ensure that they are as safe and as comfortable as possible. For 
participants’ comfort within the scanner, they lie on a padded table with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_121677]. A 
blanket is also provided to keep participants warm during the procedure. If the participant appears
nervous or anxious, a trained member of the research staff remains with them inside the scanning
suite for the duration of the scan. The participant is given a squeeze ball to terminate the scan at
any time. If he/she squeezes the ball, he/she will be removed from the scanner immediately.
Participants may decline the MRI scans at any time. If the participant chooses not to be scanned,
his/her participation in the study will not be affected. Of course, a structural MRI scan would be
required to participate in the PET scans. Any subject who cannot have at least a structural MRI
scan would not be able to participate in this protocol. All of the MRI procedures are conducted on
the 3-Tesla MRI scanner at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. Conducting these procedures
will be an accredited Magnetic Resonance Technologist and one member of the research staff
(Bachelor’s Level or Higher), or [CONTACT_121726] or Broft, present. 
PET Scanning
9. The neuroimaging subset of depressed subjects will have 2 [11C]-raclopride PET scans: (1) pre-treatment
and (2) post-treatment (at the end of the 3 week duration trial).
Protocol Summary  Form
[ADDRESS_136448] (such as placement of  venous line)  and the progress of the 
radiotracer synthesis. As  scan time approaches, the subject will be  placed  in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_121678] (blood pressure  and heart rate) obtained. Head will be positioned  and a  
headholder will be  used to decrease head movement during  the scan. 
 
12. Baseline scan: A low dose CT transmission scan is then obtained prior [11C] raclopride administration. At the end of  the transmission scan, a  maximum of 14 mCi of [11C] raclopride will be injected 
intravenously. The dose of [11C] raclopride, diluted in a 10 cc syringe, will be given as a  single bolus over  a 
period of 30 seconds. [11C] raclopride  will be  prepared by [CONTACT_121699]-ligand staff  of the PET Center 
and will be administered by [CONTACT_121700] (Drs. Arif Sheikh,  Esther  Coronel, or 
Randy Yeh). Study  physicians will  be present  for all radiotracer  injections. All  study physicians  have New  
York State Medical license and have  had extensive  training and  experience with  these types of PET studies. 
[11C] raclopride will be synthesized  and tested for purity and sterility  according to  our standard procedure. 
The injected dose of  [11C]-raclopride for each  scan will not
exceed [ADDRESS_136449]-treatment scan: As close to the end  of the 3 week study as possible (based on PET scheduling),  
subjects will undergo  their post treatment scan.  We will follow  standard procedures for measuring L-
DOPA-induced changes in synaptic dopamine  levels set forth  in PET studies of PD patients. Subjects will 
be given 75mg carbidopa/300mg L-DOPA approximately 1.5 hours  before scanning. Subjects in  week 3 of 
the protocol are  taking  450mg LDOPA per  day (150mg  three  times daily), so the 300mg administered prior 
to the post-treatment  PET scan will constitute 300mg of their usual  450mg daily  dose  on the scan  day. A 
low dose  CT transmission scan is obtained  prior to intravenous administration of 14mCi [11C] raclopride 
(or less). The  start of tracer  injection  will be timed  to coincide with the time of onset of L-DOPA effects 
(approximately 60-90 minutes following oral dose). Thus, the [ADDRESS_136450]  will be evaluated (including mental  status and vital signs) by a 
study physician. Vital  signs, and physical  exam  will be performed prior to  discharge from  the PET  suite.
 
14. We are aware that the scanning dose  of 300mg given at once approximates but may not match  the CNS 
effects of subchronic dosing with 150mg tid. However, this method has the advantages of being consistent  
with imaging studies of  PD patients in which  L-DOPA doses  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 250-300mg  and avoiding 
confounding of ∆BPND estimates  by [CONTACT_121701] D2 receptors occurring with subchronic  
administration. Since  nausea is a known side  effect  of L-DOPA, we will be particularly vigilant about 
monitoring for it. When nausea  occurs  patients generally feel warm  and sick to  their stomachs. It  will likely

data. In terms of on-site execution of PET and MRI scans, these are supervised by [CONTACT_9154] (Bret 
Rutherford) and/or [CONTACT_121727], who works with the Aging Program as a study clinician and has a 
research background in PET neuroimaging. 
Clinical treatment
16. An effort will  be made for all subjects to be titrated up to 450mg L-DOPA over a [ADDRESS_136452] cognition (i.e., 150-
300mg) but lower than levels used for PD (i.e., 600-1200mg) that may have greater side effects. Each 
subject will start taking 37.5mg carbidopa/150 mg levodopa (1.5 25/100 sinemet tablets) once daily for one 
week, then increase to 75mg carbidopa/300mg levodopa (1.5 25/100 sinemet tablets twice daily) for one 
week, and finally increase to 112.5mg carbidopa/450mg levodopa (1.5 25/100 sinemet tablets three times 
daily) for one week. Each subject will be titrated to 450mg L-DOPA unless they cannot tolerate higher 
doses, in which case subjects will have their dosage reduced to the maximum tolerable dose.
17. Although each subject is titrated up to 450mg L-DOPA if it is tolerated, the study design allows us to
assess the effects and tolerability of three different L-DOPA doses (150mg, 300mg, and 450mg). Based on 
published work using L-DOPA for PD, we expect effects on cognition and gait to be apparent at each 
dosing level approximately 5 days after dosage increases. By [CONTACT_121702], we will thus 
obtain measures of L-DOPA’s effect on processing and gait speed at each dosing level. We carefully 
reviewed the literature and consulted our Co-Investigator [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_121679] (neurologist and PD expert) 
for evidence of carry-over effects of L-DOPA dosing (such that prior experience with 150mg and 300mg 
may influence a subject’s experience of receiving 450mg). We found little evidence to suggest there are 
significant carry-over effects from previous L-DOPA doses, so each dose will be able to be assessed on its 
own merits. Similarly, we do not anticipate that the repeated assessments of processing and gait speeds will 
bias the study results.
18. In selecting L-DOPA doses, we balanced appropriate safety concerns regarding the use of this
medication in a novel patient population with the goal of causing a measurable effect. L-DOPA is an 
extremely well tolerated medication at doses < 600mg, which is substantially less than the doses often 
reached in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (900-1200mg). L-DOPA has been administered to healthy 
subjects in single dose studies and found to be well-tolerated. In Parkinson’s disease, a recent clinical trial 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine randomized patients to receive 150mg, 300mg, or 
600mg L-DOPA for [ADDRESS_136453] a screening/evaluation visit, PET/MRI scanning day (for those receiving
imaging), and weekly visits from Week 0-3. 
20. At baseline, we will record each subject’s chief complaint, referral source, age of onset of mood and/or
cognitive decline, number prior depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], age, sex, marital status, race and ethnicity, years of 
education, employment status and income, years of education, family history. We also will document 
medical history, physical exam, urine drug screen, CBC, chemistries and electrolytes, thyroid profile, 
vitamin B12 and folate levels, urine analysis, and ECG. Vital signs will be measured at baseline and 
monitored weekly throughout the study. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) (112) will 
be filled out at baseline to measure chronic medical illness burden. Subjects’ current physical pain will be 
assessed weekly using a 100mm Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and used as a covariate in analyses of gait 
speed (113).
21. The following measures will be collected weekly throughout the study: 24-item HRSD, CGI Severity
and Improvement, Structured Pi[INVESTIGATOR_121680], Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
(questions 32 and 33 will be used in this study to assess the duration and disability of dyskinesias caused by 
L-DOPA), Treatment Emergent Side Effect Scale, and Inventory of Depressive Symptoms—Self Report 
(IDS-SR). 
22. In addition, processing and gait speed assessments will be performed weekly at 1pm to control for time
of day effects and the duration since the last morning L-DOPA dose (anticipated to be 4 hours). Processing 
speed will be assessed using the Digit Symbol test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-
III) (119) and the Pattern and Letter Comparison tests (120). These tests are all reliable and valid, with 
moderate to high loadings on the latent speed factor. A latent factor (and subsequent factor score) will be 
extracted from the 3-test battery pre- and post-treatment and used as the main outcome in the R61. By 
[CONTACT_121698] a latent factor and factor loadings we will utilize a more pure measure of processing speed than if 
we used the raw scores from an individual test or a sum total score from the three raw scores combined 
(121-124). 
23. Gait will be assessed as both a single and dual task (ST, DT) on a 15' walking course in the LLDC. For
the ST, patients are instructed to walk at their usual or normal speed over the 15’ walking course. For the 
DT, patients are instructed to walk at their usual pace while simultaneously verbally listing as many animals 
as possible (fluency DT). In addition, a counting DT will be used in which patients are instructed to walk at 
their usual pace while simultaneously performing serial subtractions by [CONTACT_121703] 100 (125). Patients 
will start and end at a point 2 meters from beginning of the 15' course to eliminate acceleration and 
deceleration effects. Each ST and DT will be assessed two times with the average used in the analyses. The 
ST assessment of walking speed in m/s will be used as the primary outcome measure for this study.

Criteria for  Early Discontinuation  
Criteria for Early Discontinuation
The risk of non-response or adverse events to L-DOPA during the study period is addressed by [CONTACT_121704]. These criteria are (1) participant 
withdraws his or her consent; (2) significant clinical worsening as defined by a slowing assessment rating 
using the CGI-Improvement scale of 6 (worse) or 7 (much worse) for 2 consecutive visits; or (3) 
development of significant side effects or an adverse event. Any subjects meeting any of these criteria will 
be withdrawn from the study and treated clinically. Furthermore, subjects may be withdrawn if they 
repeatedly miss scheduled appointments or clinical worsening necessitates more intensive treatment. No 
treatment is currently available for slowing, so there is not a standard of care treatment to offer patients 
withdrawn from the study. Thus, withdrawn patients will be followed in the open treatment period, offered 
appropriate psychiatric treatments if they have any conditions requiring treatment (e.g., depression), and be 
referred to their internist for close medical follow up.

Treatment
 to be provided at the end of the study
We will provide [ADDRESS_136461]’s 
response to L-DOPA. This clinician will discuss with each subject on a case-by-case basis the risks and 
benefits of continuing L-DOPA treatment as well as other treatment options if warranted. Those who have 
benefited from the treatment and have not had significant side effects may elect to continue receiving 
LDOPA after receiving an explanation of the potential risks of chronic administration. If they do not want to 
continue L-DOPA, it will be discontinued after a [ADDRESS_136462]. Patients who
would rather receive treatment elsewhere will be given referrals to appropriate and affordable care.
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that could be encountered during the study period
1. Interview, emergencies, and possible suicidal ideation. Subjects may experience discomfort during the
clinical interview and evaluations when discussing symptoms and current life events. The study 
coordinators are experienced and skilled in interviewing depressed subjects. Half-way through the initial 
assessment, the coordinator will ask the subject if they would like to take a break, and this will be provided 
if desired. A study clinician will be available during all aspects of the assessment if there are any questions 
or problems. In addition, should the subject express suicidal ideation at any time during the interview, the 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_136463] and to determine the appropriate course 
of action. Options for addressing suicidal ideation will include contact[CONTACT_121708]’s mental health 
caregiver, referring for urgent (same day) evaluation and treatment in an outpatient clinic, or emergency 
room evaluation and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Similar practices will be used for other emergencies, including but not 
limited to psychosis, homicidal or violent thoughts, or an acute change in a subject’s physical status.
2. L-DOPA Side Effects: Side effects will be assessed at each planned visit and if needed through additional
or unscheduled contacts. We will attempt to minimize side effects by [CONTACT_121709]. We will withdraw subjects from the study if they cannot tolerate the lowest 
dose of carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) 37.5mg/150mg daily.
L-DOPA is a well-tolerated medication at the doses we will be using in this study. Older (i.e., 1960s-70s 
era) case studies report administering L-DOPA doses of 400-1200mg and in some cases much higher to 
depressed, non-PD patients over subacute time periods (4-12 weeks). Variable clinical results were 
observed, but few side effects were reported and no dyskinesias. More recently, a double-blind study 
(conducted by [CONTACT_15957]-Investigator Yaakov Stern and colleagues) of a single dose of L-DOPA 200mg vs. 
placebo investigated the role of dopamine in the impaired interval timing abilities observed in older adults. 
Thirty two healthy aged participants aged 71.2 ± 7.6 years were trained to produce two target time intervals 
(6 and 17 seconds in duration) in separate blocks corresponding to drug/placebo administration. Of the [ADDRESS_136464] noted. There are sporadic other reports in the literature 
examining the effects of single-dose 200mg L-DOPA on cognitive outcomes in healthy controls (e.g., Rihet 
et al, Psychopharmacology 2002; Hasbroucq et al, Psychopharmacology 2003), but no other recent (i.e., 
post 2000) studies have been performed of subacute L-DOPA dosing in healthy controls.  
There are many studies of chronic L-DOPA administration for the treatment of PD, since this drug has been 
used since the 1960s. Perhaps the most relevant recent study was a clinical trial published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine in 2004 (72). In this study 361 patients with PD were randomized to receive 
150mg, 300mg, or 600mg L-DOPA for 40 weeks. In the 150mg and 300mg L-DOPA treatment groups, 
which are similar to the 100mg and 300mg treatment groups being used in the R61 Phase of this study, the 
only side effects observed that were different from placebo were headache and nausea. No dyskinesias or 
other neuropsychiatric effects were observed that were greater than the placebo group, and this study lasted 
40 weeks as opposed to 3 weeks in the R61 Phase of this study. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_121681], and 
recognizing that we include a different patient population, we will carefully assess subjects with new 
complaints to determine if they may be related to study drug and if there is a need for closer monitoring or 
change in study drug dosing.
a. L-DOPA common side effects: In patients taking L-DOPA for the management of bradykinesia and
freezing associated with PD, the most common side effects are dyskinesias (i.e., choreiform, dystonic, and 
other involuntary movements) and nausea.
b. Other L-DOPA side effects: blood pressure changes, orthostasis, anorexia, dyspepsia, constipation,
psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g., delusions, hallucinations), vivid dreams, and nightmares.
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_136465], Bret
Page 26  of 43
c. Discontinuation Syndrome: A neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome (fever, akinetic crisis, rigidity,
autonomic disturbances) has been reported following withdrawal of levodopa in patients with PD.
3. PET imaging—Radiation Exposure: The dose of radiation will be submitted for approval to the
Columbia University Medical Center Joint Radiation Safety Committee (JRSC). All scans will be done in 
the presence of medical supervision and trained nursing staff in an institution specifically designed to 
support imaging studies. In the event of serious medical complications, the PET scan facilities have 
immediate access to, or consultation with, specialized medical units at the Columbia University Medical 
Center (CUMC). Preparation of radiopharmaceuticals and performance of PET scans will be by 
[CONTACT_57223], physicians, and technologists of the Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical 
Center. These professionals are qualified by [CONTACT_96131]. Subjects will be asked about their previous radiation exposure and those who have 
had research exposure within the past year will be excluded if their cumulative annual exposure (including 
the present study) exceeds FDA limits. The study doctor will be informed regarding subjects’ previous 
radiation exposure.
Dose estimates indicate that the maximum, permissible single study dosage of [11C]-raclopride in human 
subjects, to remain below the CFR 361.1 dose limits for research subjects, is 42.8 mCi (i.e., calculation 
based upon gallbladder as the critical organ; 5 rads per single study limit and 0.117 rads per mCi to the 
gallbladder). Thus, a dose of max 14 mCi per injection, and the dose associated with participation to this 
study (2 injections: 28 mCi) will be within this limit. Subjects will be instructed not to participate in any 
other research studies that include radiation exposure during the year starting on the day of the first study. 
Subjects exposed to radiation in the work place are excluded, as well as subjects exposed to nuclear 
medicine procedures during the previous year, including research protocols.
4. PET imaging—The dose of raclopride used in this study is negligible (equal or below 6.94 μg  per
administration) and is expected to induce less than 5% occupancy of D2 receptors. [11C]raclopride is a
radiotracer that has been extensively used to measure striatal D2 receptors both in the US and in
Europe. Side effects have never been reported at the tracer doses used in PET studies. In
addition, unlabeled raclopride has been tested at pharmacological doses in humans, as a potential
antipsychotic drug. Its safety and tolerability have been well characterized (Farde et al., 1989;
Farde et al., 1988; Cookson et al., 1989; The British Isles Raclopride Study Group, 1992) Therefore, we do 
not anticipate any pharmacological effects from the radiotracer used in the proposed studies. As with any 
drug, the possibility of idiosyncratic reaction exists and is mentioned in the consent forms. A physician is 
present at each experiment.
5. Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Although this procedure is generally low-risk, there are particular
concerns.
 Individuals will be screened for the presence of implanted metal (including but not limited to 
medical devices, shrapnel, tattoos or permanent makeup). Those who screen positive will be excluded from 
the study. Claustrophobia is also an issue for many potential subjects. During the MRI, subjects will have 
voice contact [CONTACT_4490] a radiology technician, and they may request the scan be stopped at any time.
6. Incidental Findings: Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Another risk is the occurrence of incidental findings
on MRI. All scans are reviewed at time of acquisition and concerning findings are discussed with an 
attending neuroradiologist. Should any concerning findings be seen, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_121682]
[ADDRESS_136466] along with recommendations for further evaluation, and facilitate referrals for such evaluation 
and treatment.
7. Breach of confidentiality: There is the potential risk of breach of confidentiality of clinical, genetic, and
laboratory information. [CONTACT_121731] has extensive experience as a clinical investigator in dealing with 
sensitive information and assuring that data is adequately protected. Safeguards to protect confidentiality 
include locked records and firewalls around password-protected electronic data, and all study data being 
coded, with the key linking the code with a subject’s identity being kept in a separate, locked file.
8. a. Risks of placing an intra-venous catheter. Drawing blood from and inserting an intravenous line (IV) 
into an arm vein are safe and standard medical procedures. Sometimes a bruise will occur at the puncture 
site and rarely a blood clot or infection will occur in the vein. Certain individuals may feel light-headed 
during venipuncture. The volume of blood collected during this study, include screening laboratories, will 
be approximately 2-[ADDRESS_136467] any serious negative effects on the study 
participants. b. Risks of blood draw: In the obtaining a 20 cc blood sample, patients can experience side 
effects that include pain, fainting, bruising, light-headedness, and, on rare occasions, infection. The staff 
will take every precaution to avoid these difficulties. The staff members are all certified at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121683], and are instructed to keep the comfort and welfare of our patients as their 
primary priority. 
9. Gait speed assessment: During the gait speed assessment, patients may feel unsteady and as such their
risk of falls may increase. To mitigate these risks, patients are accompanied by [CONTACT_121710]/or 
doctors during each of the performance-based assessments. Coordinators walk slightly behind and alongside 
the patients during the gait assessment, providing support for the patients should they become unsteady 
during the procedure.
Describe procedures for minimizing risks
1. The study coordinators are experienced and skilled in interviewing subjects with a variety of mental
health issues. Half-way through the initial assessment, the coordinator will ask the subject if they would like 
to take a break, and this will be provided if desired. A study clinician will be available during all aspects of 
the assessment if there are any questions or problems. In addition, should the subject express suicidal 
ideation at any time during the interview, the study clinician will be contact[CONTACT_121711]. Options for addressing suicidal ideation will 
include contact[CONTACT_121708]’s mental health caregiver, referring for urgent (same day) evaluation and 
treatment in an outpatient clinic, or emergency room evaluation and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Similar practices will 
be used for other emergencies, including but not limited to psychosis, homicidal or violent thoughts, or an 
acute change in a subject’s physical status.
2. Side effects will be assessed at each planned visit and if needed through additional or unscheduled
contacts. We will attempt to minimize side effects by [CONTACT_121712]. We will withdraw subjects from the study if they cannot tolerate the lowest dose of
carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) 37.5mg/150mg daily.
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_136468] year will be excluded if their cumulative annual
exposure (including the present study) exceeds FDA limits. The information on the previousradiation 
exposure of study subjects will be notified to the study doctor.
4. In terms of raclopride pharmacologic effects, we do not anticipate any pharmacological effects from the
radiotracer used in the proposed studies. As with any drug, the possibility of idiosyncratic reaction exists 
and is mentioned in the consent forms. A physician is present at each experiment. 
5. To minimize MRI risks, each subject will fill out the MRI Safety Questionnaire before the study. Only
subjects who fulfill the criteria by [CONTACT_57226]. In addition,
subjects will remove all metal (watch, hair pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], jewelry) before entering the MRI room. If the
subject has any metallic prostheses/implants they will be excluded from the study. If a subject
becomes anxious during the scan they can request that the MRI scan be stopped. 
6. [CONTACT_121731] has extensive experience as a clinical investigator in dealing with sensitive information
and assuring that data is adequately protected. Safeguards to protect confidentiality include locked records 
and firewalls around password-protected electronic data, and all study data being coded, with the key 
linking the code with a subject’s identity being kept in a separate, locked file. 
7. Risks of bruising, clotting, and infection during IV placement and blood draw will be minimized by
[CONTACT_121713]. To avoid 
injury due to fainting, the antecubital vein catheter will be inserted when the subjects are recumbent. 
8. The staff will take every precaution to avoid difficulties with gait speed assessments. Patients are
accompanied by [CONTACT_121710]/or doctors during the test of gait speed. Coordinators walk 
slightly behind and alongside the patients during the gait assessment, providing support for the patients 
should they become unsteady during the procedure.
Methods to  Protect Confidentiality
Describe methods to protect confidentiality
All records of the participating subjects will be kept in a locked room with access provided only to staff
members. Patients’ names will be linked with code numbers in a password protected file to which only the
research assistant has access. Only these code numbers will appear on all pi[INVESTIGATOR_121684]. All data collected will be kept confidential and used for professional purposes only.
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_136469], Bret
Page 29  of 43
Publications using these data will be done in a manner that protects the subjects’ anonymity. All
electronically stored data will be accessible by [CONTACT_121714] [INVESTIGATOR_121685].
Data shared with the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) will maintain patient 
confidentiality by [CONTACT_121715] 18 identifiers (outlined by [CONTACT_2373]) prior to data sharing. 
Will the study be conducted under a certificate of confidentiality?
No
Direct Benefits  to Subjects  
Direct Benefits  to Subjects
There is no direct benefit to subjects. If L-DOPA treatment is effective in ameliorating slowing, subjects
may experience improved quality of life and decreased of falls and other sequelae of slowing.
Compensation and/or Reimbursement 
Will compensation or reimbursement for expenses be offered to subjects?
Yes
Please describe and indicate total amount and schedule of payment(s). 
Include justification for compensation amounts and indicate if there are bonus payments.
Subjects will receive reasonable reimbursement for transportation related costs associated with study 
involvement as long as they provide receipts.
Subjects will receive $25 for each weekly study visit (Week 0, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3) attended. This 
money will be paid by [CONTACT_121716] a total of $100 if all study visits are 
attended.  
Subjects will receive $50 for each MRI scan ($100 total for the MRI) and $150 for completing each PET 
scan ($300 total for PET). Of note, subjects will be compensated for scheduled scans if they are brought to 
the MRI or PET suites and the scans are not completed that day due to chemistry failure or other similar 
issues.
Thus, subjects undergoing neuroimaging  may earn $400 in this study, which will be a lump sum payment 
mailed in the form of a check at the conclusion of the study, plus an additional $100 cash ($25 cash at the 
end of each weekly visit) if all weekly study visits are also completed. If a subject does not complete the 
study, payment is pro-rated to portions completed. Subjects are advised to allow 1-[ADDRESS_136470], Bret

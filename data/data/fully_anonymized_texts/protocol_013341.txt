Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  6 Protocol Synopsis  
Title Randomized, Placebo- Controlled, Phase 3 Trial of RHB -102 (Ondansetron 24 
mg Bimodal Release Tablets ) for Presumed Acute Gastroenteritis  or Gastritis  
Study 
location  US multicenter  
Study drug  RHB -102 (Ondansetron 24 mg Bimodal Release Tablets ) 
Comparator  Placebo  
Rationale  Ondansetron was the first [ADDRESS_1127066] commonly used non- 5- HT
3 antiemetics, 
prochlorperazine and promethazine, while reasonably effective may cause 
significant adverse events  much more commonly than ondansetron. In recent 
published studies of patients with acute gastroenteritis, 50% or more who 
receive placebo do not vomit during the study observation period. Thus, 
patients may be exposed to potential toxicity without therapeutic benefit.  Therefore, use of a placebo with rescue is justified in this situation.  
Ondansetron causes side effects in few patients, but gastroenteritis patients 
administered intravenous or immediate release oral ondansetron frequently 
require multiple doses to control t heir symptoms.  Thus, use of a modified 
release formulation may be of considerable benefit by [CONTACT_813961], which is usually approximately one day.  
Objec tives 
Primary:   
Comparison of the proportion of pat ients  who are treatment successes, i.e., 
fulfill all three of the following criteria:  a) without further vomiting , b) without 
rescue medication, and c)  who were not given intravenous hydration ≥[ADDRESS_1127067] 
dose of study medication.  
Secondary:  Comparison between ondansetron and placebo groups of  
• Treatment success, as defined above, through [ADDRESS_1127068] 
dose of stud y medication 
• Proportion of patients who experience each of the components of treatment failure:  
o Vomiting  
o Rescue antiemetic therapy

Design  Randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group study  
Methodology  Patients presenting to the emergency department who fulfill entry criteria will 
be asked to participate.  Qualifying patients, once they have signed  consent, 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] ( ≥ vs <age 18) and randomized 60:40 to RHB -102 or 
matching placebo.  
Patients will receive one oral dose of study medication as soon as feasible.  If a patient vomits within 15 minutes of the initial dose of study medicat ion, 
he/she will receive a second dose.  If a patient vomits again, regardless of how long after the second dose of study medication, no further study medication will be administered.  
Patients vomiting ≥[ADDRESS_1127071] dose of study medication may 
receive rescue antiemetics, either parenterally or orally.  In addition, a) 
patients with severe nausea ≥ 30 minutes after dosing with study medication 
and who  in the treating physician ‘s opi[INVESTIGATOR_813946], may receive 
rescue medication.  b) These patients may receive intravenous hydration in 
addition to or in place of parenteral antiemetics if they are unable to tolerate 
oral hydration. However, only severely symptomatic patient s clearly unable to 
tolerate oral hydration may receive intravenous hydration.

Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  9 Any patient receiving rescue medication or parenteral hydration will be 
deemed a treatment failure.  
Metoclopramide 0.3 mg/kg, maximum dose 10 mg, administered intravenously 
will be the default rescue medication.  Oral metoclopramide or other 
antiemetics administered either intravenously or orally may be used at the 
investigator’s discretion.  However, patients are not to receive ondansetron 
or other [ADDRESS_1127072] 24 hours after 
administration of study medication.   The following 5 -HT3 antagonists are 
available in the US:  alosetron (Lotronex), dolasetron (Anzemet), granisetron 
(Sancuso and others), ondansetron (Zofran, Zuplenz and others), palonsetron 
(Aloxi).  
Oral fluids will be administered as tolerated once a patient has not vomited for 
30 minutes  after dosing with study medication (second dose for those patients 
receiving 2 doses in the ED) .  Guidelines for administration of oral fluids are 
shown on page 20, section 4.4.1, of the protocol.  
Patients tolerating oral fluids will be discharged once deemed stable by [CONTACT_813964] 4  hours after dosing.  On discharge, 
patients will be given 3 additional doses of study medication t o take once daily 
if necessary.  
Patients who do not tolerate oral fluids may receive parenteral hydration.  
Data will be collected daily for up to 4 days following study initiation (until symptoms have resolved) to ascertain whether the patient had further 
vomiting, other sequelae of the acute gastroenteritis or required further 
medical care for the gastroenteritis.   Data may be collected by [CONTACT_813965] a caregiver into a web -based system or on paper, or by [CONTACT_813966] a study st aff member.   If during the follow -up period, 
symptoms progress or worsen or new symptoms develop, the patient may be 
asked to return for further evaluation.  If by [CONTACT_4475] 4 after discharge (i.e., the day 
after the last dose of study medication), the patient s till notes gastroenteritis 
symptoms, he or she will be instructed to return for further evaluation.

Safety:  Incidence and severity of adverse events through time of last follow -up call  
Statistics  Successful treatment  is absence of further vomiting from 30 minutes through 
24 hours  after initial administration of study administration without use of 
rescue antiemetic  or parenteral hydration.  It is expected that 40% of the 
placebo group and 20% of the ondansetron group will fail therapy.  To 
demonstrate a statistically significant difference with two- tailed p value=0.01 
and power=90%, 320 patients wil l be entered into the study, 192 randomized 
to RHB -102 and 128 to placebo . 
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< or ≥ age 18) at baseline.  
Patient demographics and disease characteristics will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
Safety and efficacy analyses will be based on all patients who receive any study medication.  
A subgroup of patients, as defined in section 7.2 of the protocol, will also be evaluated for efficacy.  
The incidence of treatment failure (vomiting, use of rescue medication or 
parenteral hydration fr om 30 minutes through 24 hours after initial 
administration of study medication) will be compared by [CONTACT_535519] -Haenszel test.  
No interim analysis will be conducted.

Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  13 1. Background and Rationale  
1.1 Acute Gastroenteritis  
Acute gastroenteritis is inflammation of the stomach, small intestine or large 
intestine, leading to a combination of abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (Graves, 2013).  Acute gastritis is inflammation of the stomach; patients with acute gastritis may have vomiting without diarrhea.  For purposes of this protocol, patients must present with at least vomiting, as described below,  with or without other symptoms.   
Acute gastroenteritis is a major health problem worldwide.  While mortality is greatest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_813947], morbidity of acute gastroenteritis is shared by [CONTACT_813969].   In the US, most 
cases of acute gastroenteritis are viral, most commonly rotavirus and norovirus (Chow et al, 2010;  Graves, 2013).  In the US, there are between 15 -25 million 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_813948], leading to 3- 5 million office visits and 
200,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  While mortality is low, among the 17,000 people dying 
from acute gastroent eritis in the US each year, 83% are over age 65 (CDC, 
2012).    
Most cases are self -limited, resolving in one to several days.  Mild to moderate 
cases are generally treated symptomatically.  In children, there are guidelines for oral rehydration therapy.  M ore severe and prolonged cases may require 
diagnostic studies for etiologic organisms.  Depending on the severity and etiology, treatment varies from dietary modifications, including oral rehydration therapy, to intravenous fluids and antibiotics.  Antiemetics and antidiarrheals are often used.   Prochlorperazine and  perphenazine are both approved for treatment 
of nausea and vomiting in general, i.e., including for treatment of acute gastroenteritis.  Several other products approved for treatment of nausea and vomiting in special situations, e.g., postoperatively or in association with cancer chemotherapy, are also used for this indication.  Ondansetron is often used in both children and adults with acute gastroenteritis, but has never been approved for this indication in any country.  
1.2 Ondansetron for Acute Gastroenteritis   
Ondansetron has been studied in several studies in acute gastroenteritis, 
primarily in children  (Chow et al, 2010.   In seven studies, either intravenous ( 3 
studies) or oral (4 studies) ondansetron was compared against placebo, and in 
two intravenous ondansetron was compared against active agents.  Most of the studies against active agents demonstrated a significant decrease in the proportion of patients with vomiting subsequent to dosing .  Overall, the proportion 
of patients with vomiting in the emergency department after ondansetron was about half that after placebo.  Only one study, comparing ondansetron with prochlorperazine, was entirely in adults, and one additional study, with ondansetron compared to placebo, was in children and adults, though most participants were children.  Thus, ondansetron has not been studied extensively in clinical trials in adults with acute gastroenteritis.  
RHB -102 for A cute Gastroenteritis   April 7 , 2014  
Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  [ADDRESS_1127083] demonstrated rapid early release, with appearance of drug in the plasma within hal f an hour of 
dosing, similarly to immediate release Zofran® , but with sustained drug 
availability over [ADDRESS_1127084] other agents in two studies.   While 
often used clinically, its activity in adults and adolescents with acute gastroenteritis has not been demonstrated.  Thus, a prospective randomized study of ondansetron in a major patient population will provide clear evidence of 
the efficacy of the drug, or lack thereof, in this population.  
The study will of necessity enroll only those patients who are likely to tolerate oral medications.  Patients with vomiting at a frequency which make it difficult for 
them to hold down a pi[INVESTIGATOR_813949].  However, for the large population of patients with moderate gastroenteritis, treatment of the disease wi thout intravenous is clearly preferable.  
In addition to being easier and more comfortable even in an emergency 
department setting, it will allow treatment of patients outside the emergency room, providing both patient convenience and economic benefits as compared to parenteral treatments in an emergency department.  
Use of a placebo control allows demonstration of activity with a reasonable sample size.  Ondansetron has a very benign safety profile; one of the side effects of ondansetron, constipation, is actually a therapeutic benefit in the intended indication.  In contrast, adverse events  are more common with 
phenothiazines and metoclopramide, and they may be severe.  These include dystonia and akasthesia.  Therefore, use of a placebo control in patients with moderate gastroenteritis may spare some patients toxicity in a situation where not all patients require pharamacologic intervention.  Those patients who do require medication will promptly receive an active rescue intervention.

A total of 3 20 adults and children ≥age 12 with vomiting from presumed  acute 
gastroenteritis  or gastritis  of ≤[ADDRESS_1127087] been nonbloody  (streaks of blood presumed due to 
force of retching are allowed) . 
3. All patients (or a parent or guardian for patients <age 18) must sign 
informed consent .  Patients <age  [ADDRESS_1127088] also give assent to participate.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Severe dehydration  
There is no generally accepted definition of severe dehydration in adults.  As a working definition for purposes of this study, severe dehydration is defined as two or more of the following criteria in the presence of decreased intake and increased output due to vomiting or diarrhea:  
• absent or severely decreased urine output,  
• weak pulse and/or low blood pressure,  
• parched mucus membranes ,

hydration and/or parenteral antiemetic medication  
3. Temperature>39.0°C  
4. Likely etiologies for acute vomiting and diarrhea other than acute infectious or toxic gastroenteritis  or gastritis  
a. This includes signs of an acute abdomen, which may require surgical intervention 
5. Chemically -induced gastroenteritis, e.g., from alcohol,  other drugs of 
abuse or other irritant chemicals  
6. Use within 24 hours of study entry of specific medication for treatment of 
nausea and/or vomiting , e.g., 5 -HT3 antagonists or phenothiazines , or 
receipt of any IV fluid for any reason .  Nonspecific gastrointestinal 
remedies, such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors and homeopathic remedies, are permitted 
7. Congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia (baseline pulse<55/min), known long Q T syndrome

diabetes mellitus  controlled by [CONTACT_813971] ) are required prior to 
treatment.  
Patients will be started on oral fluids ≥30 minutes after taking study medication 
(second dose for patients who receive 2 doses in ED) if they have not vomited during that period.   Intravenous hydration should not be administered unless the 
patient has vomited or is clearly unable, after a reasonable period of time has elapsed since administration of study medication, to tolerate oral fluids.  
At 4±0.[ADDRESS_1127093]

period may be asked to come in for follow -up assessment  by [CONTACT_3462] .

obtained and determined to be negative/within acceptable limits  and the patient 
is randomized, the investigator or a designate will administer the first dose of 
study medication under observation.  If the patient vomits within 15 minutes, 
regardless of whether pi[INVESTIGATOR_813950], a second dose of study medication will be administered by [CONTACT_1720] a designate.  If a patient retches but does not actually vomit any gastric contents, no second dose will be administered.   If a patient vomits again, regardless of how long after the second 
dose of study medication, no further study medication will be administered.  
Patients vomiting ≥ [ADDRESS_1127095] dose of study medication may 
receive resc ue antiemetics, either parenterally or orally.  In addition, patients with 
RHB -102 for A cute Gastroenteritis   April 7 , 2014  
Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  19 severe nausea ≥ 30 minutes after dosing with study medication and which in the 
investigator‘s opi[INVESTIGATOR_813951].  
Metoclopramide 0.3 mg/kg, max imum dose 10 mg, administered intravenously 
will be the default rescue medication.  Oral metoclopramide or other antiemetics 
administered either intravenously or orally may be used at the investigator’s 
discretion.  However, patients are not to receive ond ansetron or other [ADDRESS_1127096] 24 hours after administration of study 
medication  either in the ED or after discharge.   The following 5- HT3 
antagonists are available in the US:   alosetron (Lotronex), dolasetron (Anzemet), 
granisetron (Sancuso and others), ondansetron (Zofran, Zuplenz and others), 
palonsetron (Aloxi).  
Oral fluids will be administered as tolerated once a patient has not vomited for 30 
minutes  after dosing with study medication (second dose for those patients 
receiving 2 doses in the ED) .  Only patients who do not tolerate oral fluids after 
an adequate attempt at oral hydration may receive parenteral hydration.  Patients 
are not to receive intravenous hydration  until it is clear to the treating physician 
that the p atient is clearly in need of parenteral hydration.  
Patients tolerating oral fluids  will be discharged once deemed stable by [CONTACT_813964] [ADDRESS_1127097] not vomited or received antiemetics other than study medication may, at the investigator’s discretion, continue treatment with study medication.  
4.3 Randomization and Blinding  
As noted above,  patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_813972] 60:40 to 
receive either RHB -102 or matching placebo.  Medication will be provided in kits 
of 5 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]:  one for initial administration, one if repeat dosing is required in the emergency department (and whic h will be retained by [CONTACT_813973]), and three which the patient will take home.  
4.[ADDRESS_1127098] ion 4.2, above.  Also, if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093], patients may receive parenteral hydration.  However, every effort should be made to avoid both rescue medications and parenteral hydration, and to proceed with oral hydration, unless it is clear that the patient will not be able to tolerate oral hydration.  
From the time a patient takes any antiemetic other than study medication, whether while in or after leaving the emergency department, or receives parenteral hydration, he or she will be deeme d a treatment failure , even in 
the absence of vomiting . 
Patients may take antipyretic and antidiarrheal medication as needed prior to or after initial dosing with study medication.   Patients may also take medications for 
gastrointestinal symptoms as long as they are not specifically antiemetics.  For 
RHB -102 for A cute Gastroenteritis   April 7 , 2014  
Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  20 example, they may use proton pump inhibitors or antacids.  Once vomiting is 
controlled, patients should resume any medications they routinely take.  
Patients for whom an intravenous medication (other than antiem etic) is indicated 
once on study may receive that medication in up to 100 mL fluid.  This will not be 
considered parenteral hydration.  For example, if a patient has a urinalysis 
suggesting infection and the investigator or other physician wish to give the 
patient an intravenous antibiotic dose, that will not be considered treatment failure as long as the drug is given in ≤ 100 mL fluid.   
If once on study, a patient requires a medication which may prolong the QTc interval, he or she should not receive further study medication.  However, evaluation of the patient should continue per protocol.  
4.4.1  Oral hydration guidelines  
The following are guidelines for oral rehydration.  These are suggested but not 
required; investigators may follow institutional procedures and should use clinical judgment in determining when and how much oral fluid to administer.  
1. After ingestion of the study drug along  with small amount of fluids, nothing 
else by [CONTACT_813974] 30 minutes.  
2. At approximately 30 minutes  after study drug administration , gently 
encourage drinking of approximatel y 8 ounces (240 mL) of fluid over the 
next 30 minutes.  
3. At approximately 60 m inutes after study drug administration , further 
encourage oral hydration according to patient symptoms , as follows:   
a. The overall goal is for the patient to ingest approximately one liter 
over 1- 2 hours  after study drug administration.  One liter is 
common , although as much as 2 liters may be taken, depending on 
the patient ’s volume status and symptom of nausea.  
b. Alternatively , a patient may ingest 600- [ADDRESS_1127099] ace.  
Please note the following:  
• Too much fluid given too quickly may increase symptoms of nausea.  
• Too little fluid:  in the absence of at least some ED rehydration, it is difficult 
to be confident the patient will further tolerate reasonable amounts of fluid at home (or to determine if the patient is failing hydration in the ED).  
From the time a patient takes any antiem etic other than study medication, 
whether while in or after leaving the emergency department, or receives any parenteral hydration, he or she will be deemed a treatment failure.  
4.4.2  Serotonin s yndrome  
RHB -102 for A cute Gastroenteritis   April 7 , 2014  
Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  [ADDRESS_1127100] been associated with conco mitant use of serotonergic drugs 
(e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some  
of the reported cases were fatal.  
Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardi a, labile 
blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be warned about and monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue RHB -102 and initiate 
supportive treatment.  
All medication s taken in the 7 days prior to study entry and from the time the 
patient arrives in the emergency room until he or she completes the study will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).   
4.[ADDRESS_1127101] not required 
rescue medication  in the emergency department will be given 3 additional doses 
of study medication to take once daily if necessary.   Patients will be instructed to 
take additional study medication if they are nauseated (whether persistent or recurrent) or have any vomiting.  However, patients are not to take study medication more than 3 days after study entry.  Thus, if a patient receives an initial dose of study medication in the emergency department, feels well the nex t 
day and does not take study medication, but subsequently has a recurrence of symptoms, that patient may not take the remaining dose of study medication on day 5.  Rather, the patient should return for reassessment during the follow -up 
period.  
Patients or  their caregivers are to complete a diary each day for 4 days, 
recording epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128], diarrhea, presence and severity of nausea, presence/development of other signs or symptoms related to the gastroenteritis, and occurrence of adverse events.   This diary may be completed either on paper 
or through a web- based system.   Alternatively, p atients or their caregivers will be 
contact[CONTACT_813975] 4 days following study initiation (until symptoms have resolved) to ascertain whether the patient had fur ther vomiting, other sequelae of 
the acute gastroenteritis or required further medical care for the gastroenteritis.  If symptoms persist for [ADDRESS_1127102] or fourth d ay.

CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  22 For patients discharged prior to 8:00 pm, the ED day diary page is to be 
completed.  The ED day diary page is to include only information regarding 
events after discharge from the ED; information on events during the patient’s ED 
stay is not to be repeated in the diary.  For those discharged 8:00 pm to midnight, 
or later, diary information is to be recorded only on the follow -up diaries.  But 
vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_813952] 8:00 pm and midnight the preceding day should be included in the information captured.  
4.6 Discontinuation of Treatment  
Patients may take study medication daily for up to 4 days (day 1 medication is 
the one or two tablets administered in the emergency department).   
• If a patient vomits or otherwise receives resc ue medication in the 
emergency department, he or she is not to receive additional study medication, even if nausea and/or vomiting is controlled with rescue medication.  
• If the QTc interval at 4 hours after initial dose of study medication is >500 
msec, stu dy medication is to be discontinued.  
• Patients experiencing recurrent nausea or vomiting after discharge from 
the emergency department and initial discontinuation of study medication due to resolution of symptoms may opt to resume study medication.  
If a pat ient experiences an adverse event, regardless of relationship to study 
medication, which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_813953], the investigator may elect to have the patient stop study medication.  
If once on study, a patient requires a medication which may prolong the QTc interval, he or she should not receive further study medication.  However, evaluation of the patient should continue per protocol.  
Patients may elect to discontinue treatment at any time.  
4.7 Replacement of Subjects  
Patients who are randomized but do not receive study medication will be replaced.  Patients who receive any study medication, even if they vomit immediately thereafter or cannot swallow the medication, will not be replaced.

• any symptoms the patient may have related to gastroenteritis, such as chills, 
fever, abdominal pain 
• adverse events  
• medications taken, either for gastroenteritis (study medication and others) or 
other c onditions  
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_813976] [ADDRESS_1127107] returned to normal daily activities.   The information 
recorded by [CONTACT_199085]/her diary card will form the basis for data collected in the follow -up calls.   If during the follow -up period,  symptoms progress or 
worsen or new symptom s develop, the patient may be asked to return for further 
evaluation.  If by [CONTACT_813977] (i.e., the day after the last dose of study 
medication), the patient still notes gastroenteritis symptoms, he or she will be instructed to return to see t he investigator or his/her designate for further 
assessment.   In addition, if the investigator is concerned that a patient may not 
be entering the data promptly and appropriately or as an added stimulus to data entry by [CONTACT_102], the investigator may al so contact [CONTACT_102].  
For patients returning due to persisten t gastroenteritis 3 days  after discharge 
from the ED , an interim history and physical examination will be performed.  
Laboratory studies may be performed if clinically indicated, and results of  these 
studies will be entered into the CRF.

6.1 Terminology  
An Adverse Eve nt (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (may also be referred to as an adverse experience) can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or marketed) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational or marketed) product  and fro m any route 
of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose results in any of the following outcomes :   
death;   
is a life-threatening  adverse event  (defined as an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe);  
requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_813956];  
a persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions;  
a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
is an important medical event .  This is defined as a medical event that may  
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], 
based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes  listed in the definition above.   Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
If either the s ponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event 
must be considered serious and be evaluated by [CONTACT_80220].  
RHB -102 for A cute Gastroenteritis   April 7 , 2014  
Protocol RHB -102-01 Amendment 5  June 9, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  27 Admission for gastroenteritis is not a serious adverse event, as the 
gastroenteritis is a preexisting c ondition, not an adverse event.  Admission for 
gastroenteritis will be considered lack of efficacy, and is recorded as such as a secondary efficacy outcome.  
If, however, a patient develops new symptoms in the ED, such as findings 
leading to a diagnosis of an acute abdomen, and is admitted, that would be 
considered a serious adverse event.  
A suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered unexpected if it is 
not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.    
6.[ADDRESS_1127109](s) are provided as a guide to be used for evaluating adverse event s reported  in this study to determine “suspected 
adverse reactions” that require expedited reported to regulatory agencies if they are unexpected.  In addition to the assessment below, the aggregate number of occurrences will be considered to decide whether the event is a reportable event and requires an IND safety report.

the sponsor within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s initial notification/awareness of the event.  All telephone communication regarding SAE must be followed by a written report. 
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  
Thus, follow -up information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well 
as supporting documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], additional lab 
and test results,  autopsy reports, etc.), should be collected subsequently, if not 
available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent to sponsor  using 
the same procedure as the initial SAE report. Information on the SAE must be in

CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  29 sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and 
independent determination of causality.  
For ease of analysis, worldwide standardization, and regulatory reporting, the sponsor will code each reported adverse event or symptom to its corresponding 
preferred  term and body system/organ class in the MedDRA dictionary version 
adopted for the study. T he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_813957] 6.3, ab ove. 
All SAE reports must be e- mailed or faxed  directly to 
 
   
 
 
 
A
s required, all investigators will be notified of all AE reports that are determined 
to be serious, unexpected, and related (by [CONTACT_813979] ) 
to the investigational product.  The notification will be in the form of a Safety Update (Dear [CONTACT_344952]).  
The notification is considered an addendum to the current Investigator’s Brochure; therefore, upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and immediately submit a co py to the IRB  according to local regulations.  The 
notification must be retained within the Investigator’s Brochur e.  The investigator 
and IRB  will determine if the informed consent requires revision.  
6.[ADDRESS_1127111] Abnormalities  
If any laboratory tests are performed on study, all new abnormal laboratory  
findings after initial administration of study medication and those abnormal at 
baseline which change significantly (i.e., by [CONTACT_813980] [NCI CTCAE] v4.0 ) are considered AEs.  Laboratory AEs for which there 
is no clinical intervention will be recorded only on the laboratory data pages of the eCRF.  Laboratory AE s not listed in the NCI CTCAE v4.0  will be considered 
as grade 1 (mild) if there is no clinical effect or intervention.  Laboratory values outside the normal range for certain parameters will not be considered AEs if they are generally not considered as indicating an abnormality; this includes such parameters as liver enzymes which are below the normal range.  If there is a clinical sequela or intervention, the laboratory abnormality is to be graded according to the criteria used for clinical AEs, desc ribed above.  
6.6 Other Safety Considerations  
Any clinically significant changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety 
assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], 
should also be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  [ADDRESS_1127112] dose of study medication:  
• absence of vomiting  
• no use of rescue medication, and  
• no intravenous hydration  
If all of the above three criteria are fulfilled, the patient is considered a treatment 
success for the primary analysis.  If one or more of the above three criteria are not fulfilled, i.e., the patient either experiences vomiting, receives rescue medication or receives intravenous hydration from [ADDRESS_1127113] dose of study medication , the patient is considered a treat ment 
failure.  
It is expected that approximately 40% of the placebo group will fail treatment during the 24 hours after initial dosing  and that RHB -102 will reduce the 
incidence of treatment failure by [CONTACT_3450] 50%, i.e., to an incidence of 20% 
in the active treatment group.  Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<18, ≥18 years of 
age) and randomized 60:40 to active versus placebo.  To demonstrate a 
statistically significant decrease in the incidence of vomit ing with a 2- tailed p-
value=0.01 and power=90% , 320 patients wil l be entered into the study, 192 
randomized to RHB -102 and 128  to placebo.  
7.2 Analysis Datasets  
Safety and efficacy analyses will be based on all patients who receive any study medication, even if they vomit shortly after administration or are unable to swallow the medication.  
Primary and selected secondary efficacy analyses will also be performed on a predefined subgroup of patients defined as follows:  
1. Meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria  
2. If they vomit within [ADDRESS_1127114] a primary diagnosis on discharge from the ED (or, if admitted, on discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) other than acute gastroenteritis or gastritis  
7.[ADDRESS_1127115] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for cont inuous variables and number and 
percentages for discrete variables.   
7.4 Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint is described above.

CONFIDENTIAL:  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  [ADDRESS_1127116] for superiority of RHB -102 vs 
placebo for the  proportion of the primary endpoint.   
The null hypothesis is that the odds ratio between two treatment groups is one, 
i.e. there is no treatment difference in the proportions of the primary endpoint.  Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_654] w ill be used to test the null 
hypothesis.  The hypothesis will be tested at an overall level of 0.05 (2- sided).    
7.4.2 Primary Analysis  
The study primary endpoint will be tested by [CONTACT_813981] (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_654].  Common odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be provided. If the observed 2- sided p- value from the CMH test  is less than 0.05, 
statistical significance will be declared.  Point estimates of the proportions for 
each treatment arm will be provided along with the corresponding 2- sided 95% 
confidence intervals.  The point estimate of the difference of the proportions between treatment arms will also be provided along with corresponding 2- sided 
95% confidence intervals.   
In addition, subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_813982] (<18, ≥18 years of age) will be conducted  for the primary and selected secondary endpoints .   For a given age 
group, unstratified CMH test will be performed.  
An additional subgroup analysis will be performed which will exclude those 
patients determined during the course of their treatment and study follow -up to 
have a diagnosis other than acute gastroenteritis or gastritis.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_1127117] dose of study medication.  It is 
expected that >90% of patients will provide data until at least 24 hours after initial dosing.  Patients who drop out of the study will be imputed as failures/non-responders for the primary analysis.  Sensitivity analyses using different imputations for missing values will be specified in the SAP.  
7.4.4 Secondary Analyses  
Additional analyses will be done comparing the following parameters between treatment groups : 
• Proportion of patients who experience or require each of the components 
of treatment failure:  
o Vomiting  
o Rescue antiemetic therapy  
o Intravenous hydration  
• Severity of nausea

• Incidence and severity of other symptoms of gastroenteritis  
• Time from first dose of study medication to discharge from ED, extended 
observation unit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], whichever comes last  
• Time to resumption of normal activities (work/school/household)  
• Proportion of patients r equiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Proportion of patients returning to emergency department for 
gastrointestinal symptoms  within 4 days of initial discharge  
7.5 Safety Analyses  
The safety and tolerability of RHB -102 will be determined by [CONTACT_187031], 
physical exam inations, vital signs, and, if performed on study,  laboratory tests. 
Subjects who receive any RHB -102 (even if they vomit shortly after 
administration) are considered evaluable for safety.  
ECGs of patients who undergo paired ECGs on the study will be analy zed for 
shifts in QTc F. 
7.5.1 Adverse Events  
The NCI -CTCAE v4.0 system will be used to grade new or worsening laboratory 
abnormalities.  New laboratory abnormalities for which there are no CTCAE v4.0 
criteria will be assigned grade 1 if there were no clinical effects or interventions, and according to the criteria in section 6.3 if there were clinical effects and/or interventions . AEs will be grouped and tabulated by [CONTACT_813983].

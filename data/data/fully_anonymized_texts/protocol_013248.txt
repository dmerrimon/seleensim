 Scientific Background  
 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one health  threat in women [ 1]. Adverse 
pregnancy outcomes (APOs),  such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational  diabetes, 
and preterm birth, affect up to 20% of pregnant women  and are recognized as major risk factors 
for latent and future  CVD [ 2,3]. Though research to disentangle the contributions  of 
prepregnancy risk factors from APOs on future CVD risk is  ongoing, interventions that prevent 
APOs as a target for reducing  CVD offer immediate and possibly long -term benefits. Effective  
preventative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], however, remain elusive [ 4]. Moderate  to vigorous -intensity p hysical 
activity reduces APO risk [ 5,6], but less than 1 in 4 pregnant women achieve guidelines [ 7]. This 
likely reflects that pregnant women report unique exercise  barriers such as fatigue, pain, medical 
restriction, and concern  for the baby [ 8].Therefore, more feasible lifestyle strategies to  prevent 
APOs are needed.  
 
One such strategy could be reducing sedentary behavior (SED),  which is defined as low -intensity 
behavior that occurs in a  seated, reclined, or lying posture [ 9]. Considering barriers to  more 
intensive physical activity during pregnancy, replacing  SED across the day with standing and 
light-intensity physical  activities may be more achievable. Excessive SED has been  related to an 
increased risk of CVD and mortality in general  populations, even after accounting for moderate - 
to vigorous -intensity physical activity [ 10]. Though sparse data  on SED during  pregnancy exist, 
our laboratory recently  completed a small cohort study among 120 pregnant women  that 
objectively measured SED and physical activity during  each trimester [ 11]. We found that, on 
average, pregnant women  had approximately 9.5 hours per day of SED, which is higher  than the 
general population [ 12]. Further, using trajectory  analysis, women with a pattern of very high 
SED across  pregnancy (approximately 11 hours per day) versus low SED  (approximately 8 hours 
per day) had 6.76 (95% CI 1.20 -38.14)  higher odds of experiencing an APO [ 11]. Of interest, 
women  in the low and medium SED groups (approximately 8 and 9  hours per day,  respectively) 
had no excess risk of APO,  indicated a possible threshold effect. Similar threshold effects  were  
observed for time spent standing and in the number of  steps per day such that only women in the 
very low trajectory  groups had excess risk. Importantly, moderate - to vigorous -intensity activity 
was not associated with APO  outcomes, bolstering support for a strategy of reducing SED by  
[CONTACT_297098] a novel intervention target  to improve pregnancy health. 
Yet, few randomized clinical trials  (RCTs) testing SED reduction interventions are available,  
especially in pregnant women.  
 
The Sedentary Behavior Reduction in Pregnancy Intervention  (SPRING) pi[INVESTIGATOR_297082], funded by [CONTACT_297099] (20TPA3549099), seeks to address these  
research gaps. SPRING is an RCT that tests the feasibility,  acceptability, and preliminary effects 
of a novel intervention  designed to reduce SED and improve  all-day activity patterns  among 
pregnant women at high risk for APOs.  
 
Study Objectives  
 
The SPRING study ’s specific aims are to (1) evaluate the effect  of SPRING versus control on 
objectively measured SED  (primary outcome, hypothesized to decrease ), standing  (hypothesized 
Page 3 of 15 
 to increase ), and steps per day  (hypothesized to  increase ); (2) evaluate the feasibility and 
acceptability of  SPRING, including recruitment, retention, outcome assessment  rates, 
intervention fidelity, and program evaluation; and (3)  estimate the preliminary effects of 
SPRING versus control on  maternal -fetal health outcomes including composite APOs  
(hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and  preterm birth), maternal blood 
pressure and glucose,  psychosocial outcomes, gestational age at birth, and infant birth  
anthropometrics.  
 
Study Design  & Methods  
 
Study Design Overview  
 
In the absence of established SED -reduction interventions or  guidelines in pregnant women, a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_297083]  (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] [Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for  Intervention Trials] checklist [ 13]. The SPRING pi[INVESTIGATOR_297084].gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
Potential participants complete baseline assessments and begin  the 1 -week baseline activity 
monitoring protocol between 10  weeks 0 days (10 0 weeks) and 12 weeks 6 days (12 6 weeks) of  
gestation. Upon receipt of valid activity monitoring data with  a completed time -use diary and 
clearance to participate from  the participant ’s prenatal care provider, pregnant women are  
randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_362575]. Participants  randomized to the usual care 
control arm do not receive the  intervention but are mailed a Fitbit Luxe after giving birth.  
 
Participants in both groups complete assessments in each  trimester and are remunerated US $[ADDRESS_362576]  trimester (baseline) assessment between 10 0 and 12 6 weeks, US  $50 for 
completing the second -trimester assessment between  200 and 22 6 weeks of gestation, and US 
$[ADDRESS_362577] -trimester assessment between 32 0 and 34 6 weeks of  gestation. After 
participants give birth, maternal -fetal outcomes  are abstracted from medical records by [CONTACT_297100].  
 
All research procedures were approved by [CONTACT_297101][INVESTIGATOR_297085]  (STUDY20110193).  
 
Recruitment and Screening  
 
Recruitment Methods  Participants are recruited from within approximately 50 miles  of the 
University of  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] ’s main campus in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109],  Pennsylvania. A variety of recruitment 
methods are used,  including the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_297086] ’s Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me research registry and targeted emails  sent to the university community. In 
addition, recruitment  messages from the study physician are sent to patients at the  University of 
Page 4 of 15 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589] ’s (UPMC) Maternal  Fetal Medicine clinic who meet eligibility  
requirements through  the MyUPMC mobile app. Finally, flyers are placed in  patient -facing areas 
of Magee -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809], the  largest birthing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297087].  
 
Screening , Orientation , and Informed Consent  
 
Interested participants are directed to complete a web -based  screening questionnaire using 
Research Electronic Data Capture  (REDCap) [ 14,15]. The screening questionnaire contains a  
detailed summary of the study, a request for electronic consent  to answer screening questions, 
and specific questions about the  candidate ’s current pregnancy, risk factors for APO, SED  
exposure and habits, chronic diseases, medications, and contact  [CONTACT_3031]. Trained  study staff 
assess initial eligibility based  on the answers to the screening questionnaire and, if a candidate  is 
deemed ineligible, they are informed at that time. Candidates  who appear to be eligible during 
initial screening are invited to  a web -based videoconference orientation where the study is  
described in detail, verbal informed consent is obtained, and  then an electronic informed consent 
document is signed by [CONTACT_297102]. 
Finally, a detailed medical and reproductive history  questionnaire is administered to determine 
final eligibility.  
 
Randomization  
 
A randomization ratio of 2:1 (2 intervention to 1 control) was  chosen to provide more robust data 
to evaluate the feasibility  and acceptability of our intervention and assessment protocols  [16]. To 
help achieve balance over time, blocks of 6 were  selected, and 9 blocks of computer -generated, 
randomly ordered  sets were placed sequentially into sealed, numbered envelopes  by a blinded 
study personnel. These envelopes were then  provided to the unblinded study personnel (principal 
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_297088]) and kept in a secure location.  
 
Participant randomization begins with the blinded study  coordinator notifying the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_24565] a participant  is eligible and has completed all baseline assessment procedures.  
The study investigator then opens the next sequential envelope  and records the randomization 
assignment and date in the  randomization log. The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_297089], describe next steps, ensure 
that the participant  comprehends that the intervention and assessment study  procedures are 
separate, and reinforce the importance of  continued participation in either group.  
 
Outcome Assessment s 
 
Study outcome assessments are conducted by [CONTACT_23872], blinded  study personnel and occur via 
web-based videoconference once  per trimester of pregnancy . Any necessary assessment  
materials are mailed to participants prior to study visits.  
 
SED and physical activity are measured in each trimester.  Objective assessment of activity 
patterns is conducted using a  thigh -mounted activPAL3 monitor (PAL Technologies,  Glasgow) 
worn for [ADDRESS_362578]-practice methodology for field 
monitoring of SED and  standing [ 17], and we have shown it to be a valid measure of  moderate - 
Page 5 of 15 
 to vigorous -intensity physical activity in pregnant  women [ 18]. Participants wear the monitor on 
the anterior upper  thigh for [ADDRESS_362579] placement. 
Detailed  written instructions on monitor wear and diary completion are  also provided. The 
activPAL3 24 -hour event data are  downloaded and cleaned by [CONTACT_297103]; remaining valid wear time is used to calculate average  daily durations of time spent in 
SED (total and in prolonged  bouts of at least 30 and 60 minutes), standing, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Daily 
frequency of steps and sit -stand transitions are also  averaged across days. Lastly, to estimate 
moderate - to vigorous -intensity physical activity, time with a steppi[INVESTIGATOR_297090] 75 
steps per minute and 100 steps per  minute  are averaged across valid wear days from daily 
summary  data. Averages are calculated overall and during working times  (if applicable). Data 
are considered valid with at least [ADDRESS_362580] 10 hours of waking wear time recorded [ 19]. 
 
Self-reported SED and physical activity are assessed using the  Pregnancy Physical Activity 
Questionnaire [ 20], with questions  regarding proportion of time spent in SED during work and  
nonworking times added to improve the accuracy of  self-reported SED assessment [ 21]. 
 
Blood pressure is assessed virtually during study assessment  visits in each trimester using a 
validated oscillometric monitor  [22]. Either a UA -611 monitor (A&D Medical) that was  
provided as part of prenatal care at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_297091] -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] a 
study -provided BP7250 monitor  (Omron Healthcare Inc) is used. Participants use the same  
monitor and cuff for all visits. During the virtual assessment,  participants first provide verbal 
confirmation of abstention from  caffeine and nicotine for [ADDRESS_362581], the  participant initiates the measurement by 
[CONTACT_297104] (to reduce participant reactivity).  The assessor leads the participant through [ADDRESS_362582] 
abstraction (described later). To capture  changes that occurred following randomization, updates 
to demographics (eg, new employment) are reported in a  questionnaire and changes to medical 
history or medication use  (eg, a new diagnosis or starting, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or changing dosage  
of medications) are assessed during an interval medical history  review at each follow -up visit.  
 
Dietary intake is assessed at each visit using the Diet Screening  Questionnaire, a  
semiquantitative questionnaire that measures  typi[INVESTIGATOR_297092] [ 23]. Psychosocial behavioral 
targets and  outcomes are measured at baseline and each follow -up visit via  web-based self -report 
questionnaires. Validated questionnaires  assessing behavioral targets of the intervention include 
Page 6 of 15 
 the Sitting during Pregnancy Barriers and Outcome Expectations  Questionnaire [ 24], Expected 
Outcomes and Barriers for  Habitual Physical Activity [ 25], the Multidimensional Scale of  
Perceived Social Support [ 26], and Social Support for Exercise  [27]. Validated questionnaires 
assessing possible psychosocial  effects of the intervention include the Profile of Mood States  
[28], the Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328]  (CES -D) [29], the Perceived Stress 
Scale [ 30], Health -Related  Quality of Life for Nausea and Vomiting during Pregnancy  [31], and 
the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] [ 32]. 
 
Adverse events are collected systematically at follow -up assessment visits by [CONTACT_297105]. Details of new or  worsening medical conditions, including pregnancy -related  adverse 
events, are recorded and classified regarding severity  and relationship. In addition, ongoing 
assessment of adverse  events in the intervention group is conducted by [CONTACT_297106]. All 
adverse events are reviewed by [CONTACT_62674] [INVESTIGATOR_1238], if needed, the study physician for 
accuracy,  possible rel ationship to the intervention, and to make any  necessary modifications or 
terminate participation in the  intervention.  
 
Pregnancy health and maternal -fetal outcomes are abstracted  from the participant’s medical 
record of prenatal visits and labor  and delivery notes. Maternal outcomes extracted include  
gestational weight gain, clinic -measured blood pressures,  pregnancy complications including 
APOs, glucose screening  values, and tolerance tests (if available), and labor and delivery  details. 
Fetal outcomes include gestational age at birth,  anthropometrics, and complications. All 
abstractions are  reviewed by a second reviewer and discrepancies are resolved.  The study’s 
maternal -fetal medicine physician coinvestigator  (AH) confirms all APOs and a random sample 
of healthy  pregnancies for accuracy.  
 
Feasibility  and Acceptabili ty 
 
Feasibility and acceptability are also assessed through a variety  of methods across the study 
period . Screening  outcomes are recorded prospectively including recruitment  sources and yield, 
eligibility rates and ineligibility reasons, and  rates of enrollment. We also administer a study -
developed  questionnaire at baseline (prior to randomization) to assess  participant expectations, 
motivations, and experiences when  enrolling in the SPRING RCT. Rates of valid assessment  
completion are also prospectively recorded. Intervention fidelity  with respect to delivery, receipt, 
and enactment [ 33] is assessed  at each intervention contact (see Intervention Content and  
Schedule section). A final web -based program evaluation  assesses acceptability and includes [ADDRESS_362583] 
intervention lesson to intervention participants  only and aims to evaluate participants ’ 
perceptions regarding  their health, usefulness of the intervention components, general  
satisfaction and acceptability of the intervention, and suggestions  for improvement.  
 
Intervention  
 
Intervention Content and Schedule   
 
SPRING developed behavioral targets informed by [CONTACT_297107], standing, and 
daily steps that were associated  with lower APO risk in our observation cohort of pregnant  
Page 7 of 15 
 women [ 11]. Specifically, we observed threshold effects  whereby [CONTACT_297108] 9.2 hours per day  or less, standing for approximately 3.8 hours per day or more,  
and accumulating approximately 7801 steps per day or more  were the activity patterns associated 
with a significantly lower  risk of an APO [ 11] along with other maternal and fetal health  benefits 
[46-48]. We also considered additional data from our  observational research regarding 
determinants, barriers,  attitudes, and outcome expectations related to SED during  pregnancy. 
Findings from these studies suggested that  pregnancy -related physical symptoms such as nausea 
and fatigue  along with work -related sitting were the most commonly  reported barriers to 
reducing SED [ 24]. Using objectively  measured SED data, we also found that desk jobs and 
fewer  children aged [ADDRESS_362584] strongly 
associated with SED during  pregnancy [ 49]. We then used these data to adapt our existing  SED -
reduction interventions in nonpregnant adults [ 50-52] to the new population of pregnant women 
at high risk for SED  and APOs.   
 
Thus, with the overall goal of reducing SED to less than 9 hours  per day, we set evidence -based 
behavioral targets for our  intervention as follows: (1) increase standing time by [ADDRESS_362585] 4 hours per day; (2)  increase light -intensity movement across 
the day, achieving at  least 7500 steps per day; and (3) increase steps by [CONTACT_2669] 250  per hour (up 
to 8 hours per day). To facilitate  behavior change toward these standing and step targets in our  
intervention group, we developed an evidence - and theory -based,  multicomponent intervention 
strategy across 3 levels of the  socioecological model [34,35,37,40].  
 
Safety and fidelity of the intervention  are assessed at each contact [CONTACT_297109]  [36], delivery (provision of intervention components), receipt  (self-report of 
intervention components working properly), and  enactment (self -report of self -monitoring and 
goal achievement)  [33]. 
 
Control Group  
 
Participants assigned to the control group are asked to continue  their typi[INVESTIGATOR_297093] a general handout regarding recommended  
physical activity during pregnancy [ 36] but received no further  intervention materials. After 
delivery, control participants are  mailed a report of their objective activity levels that were  
previously measured during the study assessments and a Fitbit  Luxe.  
 
Eligibility Criteria  
 
We recruit participants in their first trimester of pregnancy  who are at risk for high levels of SED 
and who have at least [ADDRESS_362586] an early gestational  age when 
we can intervene meaningfully across pregnancy and  higher SED appropriate for modification 
(ie, reduction) to reach  the levels that we have found to be associated with better  pregnancy 
outcomes [ 11]. The criteria of having at least [ADDRESS_362587] whether our  intervention can reduce APO risk; therefore, we sought to  evaluate feasibility 
and preliminary effects in this specific  population. Lastly, to allow for our exploratory outcome  
assessment using prenatal records of maternal -fetal outcomes,  participants are required to 
Page [ADDRESS_362588] our study  outcomes (eg, prenatal blood pressure and glucose test results).  
Any other contraindications to exercise during pregnancy or  severe mobility limitation are also 
exclusionary since the  intervention asks participants to increase standing and daily  steps. We also 
require participants to receive clearance for  participation in the intervention from their prenatal 
care provider  as an additional safety precaution. Lastly, those participating  in other interventional 
research that could confound our study  outcomes are excluded to reduce bias or contamination.

Statistical Considerations  
 
Analytic Strategy for Aim 1 and the Exploratory Aim  
 
We will use Stata (StataCorp) for all analyses with an  intention -to-treat philosophy. First, 
participant flow will be  summarized using a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials  diagram 
for randomized trials [ 53]. Second, descriptive statistics  will be computed for variables by 
[CONTACT_297110]. Third, the baseline measures will be compared between  the [ADDRESS_362590] tests, 
as appropriate. While  significant differences are not expected, any found will be  considered in 
sensitivity analyses. Next, main analyses will fit  a series of linear mixed models with follow -up 
continuous  outcomes as the  dependent variable (eg, SED); intervention  group (intervention or 
control), follow -up time (eg, second and  third trimester), and group × time as fixed effects; 
baseline value  of outcomes as fixed -effect covariates; and a participant random  effect to account 
for multiple observations from the same  participant over time. Mean contrasts will estimate the  
between -group difference at each follow -up time point. Similar  methods will be used for the 
other activity variables (eg,  standing and steps). Analysis of the exploratory aim will use  similar 
methods, with logistic regression for dichotomous  outcomes (eg, APOs). We will first consider 
the use of multiple  imputation to account for missing data, but we will perform  additional 
sensitivity or exploratory analyses to ensure  robustness and extend our findings, for example,  
complete -data-only or last -value -carried forward strategies for  missing data.  
 
Analytic Strategy Aim 2  
 
For the recruitment feasibility outcomes, we will calculate  frequencies of recruitment method use 
and yields; rates of  screening contacts, consent, eligibility, and randomization;  reasons for 
ineligibility; and characteristics of enrolled  participants. Benchmarks will be 42 (80%) for 
retention and 40  (95%) of the retained participants for valid outcome assessments.  Intervention 
fidelity will be calculated based on intervention  contacts with an overall average benchmark of 
30 (85%) of each  intervention contact [CONTACT_297111]. Quantitative or semiquantitative  acceptability 
and program evaluation data will be summarized  descriptively. Open -ended questionnaires will 
be analyzed using  a constant comparison method to identify salient categories,  themes, and 
Page 10 of 15 
 patterns via open coding, iterative review and  codebook generation, code linking into similar 
categories, and  final integration into themes [ 54]. 
 
Sample Size Considerations  
 
The primary outcome of this study is a change in SED. Based  on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_297095] [ 11], we calculated sample size requirements assuming  
the following: a between -group SED difference of 1 hour (SD  56 minutes) per day, a 2:1 
randomization ratio to enhance  recruitment and increase program evaluation and feasibility  data, 
90% power, and α=.05. This yielded a required sample  size of 42 (28 intervention and 14 
control). A final sample size  of up to 53 (35 intervention and 18 control), inflated by 20%,  was 
adopted to account for attrition.

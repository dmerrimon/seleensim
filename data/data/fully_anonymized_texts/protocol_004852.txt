 
Nasal Iodophor Antiseptic vs Nasal Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554861] : A Randomized Clinical Trial  
NCT#: 03140423  
 
4/28/ [ADDRESS_728651] a cluster -randomized non-inferiority trial comparing mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554862] S. aureus clinical cultures and all-cause bloodstream infection in the 
setting of routine chlorhexidine bathing (Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-Iodophor Swap  Out Trial). 
 
1.1 Significance and Innovation  
Intensive care units (ICUs) have one of the highest rates of healthcare-associated infections due the 
patients’ severity of illness and frequent use of medical devices.1 2 3 We previously conducted a cluster -
randomized trial of decolonization in adult ICUs (REDUCE MRSA Trial) in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554863] 
(HCA) health system .4 We showed that ICUs using chlorhexidine (CHG)  antiseptic for routine daily bathing and 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554864] a 37% reduction in methicillin -
resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) clinical cultures and a 44% reduction in all -cause bloodstream 
infection. Nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554865] 
S. aureus , one of the most common and virulent healthcare-associated pathogens.5 6 7  
In response to the REDUCE MRSA Trial and other clinical trials ,4 8 9 ICU decolonization has been 
adopted throughout HCA’s ICUs and broadly across the [LOCATION_002]. However , despi[INVESTIGATOR_554866] -pathogen ICU infection as well as  S. 
aureus  carriage and infection, 4 10 11 12 many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554867]. We found an increase in mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554868]  10% to 17% during the [ADDRESS_728652] U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 
1.2 Approach 
1.2.1 Study Population 
This trial is based in the HCA Healthcare (formerly Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554863])  system, which is 
the largest private inpatient provider in the U.S., including over 168 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554869] 23 states in the US and 
areas in the [LOCATION_008]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554870] -based, although they range in size from 
small facilities to large complex tertiary medical centers. HCA supports an annual volume of 2 million US 
admissions and 8 million emergency department visits. Overall, 1 in 20 admissions in the U.S. occurs in an HCA facility.   The Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-Iodophor  Swap Out trial will focus on the study population of patients in adult intensive 
care units (ICUs) in HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. All U.S. HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554871]. 
Exclusion criteria include ICUs with an average length of stay of less than 2 days, and HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554872] (e.g. newly -acquired hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554873]). The latter exclusion only applies to a small number of facilities, mostly those who were newly -acquired. 
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_728653] 5 days of an ICU stay and daily chlorhexidine bathing for the duration 
of the ICU stay. The corporate campaign launched in Spring of 2013 with high compliance adoption by [CONTACT_61763] 
2013. Subsequent HCA evaluations demonstrated a 24% reduction in health system ICU central line 
associated bloodstream infections attributable to universal ICU decolonization.[ADDRESS_728654] a two-arm 18-month non-inferiority cluster randomized controlled trial of 
HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], evaluating two regimens. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554874] 1 will be assigned to the mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-based usual care regimen for adult ICUs in the HCA health system. This will involve uni versal decolonization 
for all admitted patients using ICU-wide daily bathing with 2% chlorhexidine cloths for the duration of the ICU 
stay plus  topi[INVESTIGATOR_554875] (bilateral nares) for the first five days of the ICU stay. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554876]-training of HCA’s corporate guidance for this regimen and adherence will be tracked. 
Half of participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (minimum sample size of 6 0 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) will be assigned this arm. We anticipate 
an average of 1.[ADDRESS_728655] 1 05 ICUs in this arm.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554874] 2 will be assigned to the iodophor -based regimen for adult ICUs in the 
HCA health system. This will involve universal decolonization for all admitted patients using ICU -wide daily 
bathing with 2% chlorhexidine cloths for the duration of the ICU stay plus  topi[INVESTIGATOR_554877] ( 10% 
povidone-iodine to bilateral nares) for the first five days of the ICU stay. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554878]-
training of HCA’s corporate guidance for CHG bathing plus new training for the use of nasal iodophor. Adherence will be tracked. Half of participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (minimum sample size of 6 0 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) will be 
assigned this arm. We anticipate an average of 1.[ADDRESS_728656] 1 05 ICUs in this arm.  
Thus, both arms will implement some form of universal decolonization during the ICU stay.  The 
protocol will involve discontinuation of the regimen upon ICU discharge, regardless of whether the full intervention therapy had been applied during the ICU stay.

Septimus, MD (Medical Director, Infection Prevention), Julia Moody, MS  (Director, Infection Prevention and 
Control), and Jason Hickok, MBA RN  (Asst Vice President, Laboratory, Infection P revention, and Research), 
with the support of Jonathan Perlin MD PhD, Chief Medical  Officer of HCA. HCA health system is divided into 
two Groups (National and American), which in turn are divided into geographic divisions. Recruitment will be encouraged by  [CONTACT_554927].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554895] a description of both arms 
of the study. They will agree to be randomized and to implement their assigned protocol. An attestation letter 
confirming commitment to the trial will be signed by [CONTACT_554928][INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
We will use a centralized IRB structure with each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554896].  
 1.2.[ADDRESS_728658] cluster -randomized trials of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], simple randomization of 12 0 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554897], and without care could even result in very 
unequal numbers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341086]. Achieving balance on key features of the randomization units (in this case, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) is a critical task in cluster -randomized trials, but little literature on it exists. Unlike 
individually -randomized trials, information about the clusters is often known in advance, but the number of 
clusters to be randomized can be relatively small. The existence of a priori data can mitigate the sm all 
numbers and help to obtain adequate balance through stratification or other methods. One attractive approach is to establish tuplets —matched sets (pairs, for a two-arm trial) – in which one member of each tuplet is 
[ADDRESS_728659] classes of balance on a key variable and making pairs within these strata based on lower -priority variables. However, there is no “best” method of tuplet construction, only sets 
that come closer to meeting the varied needs of each trial.  
We will use methods to inform the choice of tuplet-construction scheme which we previously developed 
in the REDUCE MRSA trial. We will establish the pairs under several plausible tuplet-construction schemes, and use graphical methods to compare all possible realizations for balance between the arms under each scheme. For example, if two variables were to be balanced, we would tentatively divide the sample into two groups under a tuplet construction scheme and then generate a scatterplot showing the between-arm absolute value of the mean difference for one variable on the x -axis and the second on the y -axis for each possible 
result of the randomization. We would then divide the groups again under the same scheme, and find another point on the scatterplot. Repeating many times would show the typi[INVESTIGATOR_341088] a scheme. Comparing the resulting scatterplots from each tuplet-construction scheme can reveal the relative risks of imbalance and benefits for balance accruing to each randomization scheme, in a practical sense. One tuplet construction method may result in generally close balance on one key characteristic and very variable 
balance on the other, while a competing scheme has good median balance on both characteristics, but where 
each has a long tail implying a few bad-luck assignments with poor balance.  
We hope to consider  balance on more than two factors, and for assessing the impact on balance in this 
case, we will use a parallel coordinates plot, a multivariate plot method. A simulated example is shown in 
Figure 2. There we show a potential result of a single tuplet construction method. The variables shown are volume, baseline rate of an outcome, the baseline rate of chlorhexidine use, and baseline rate of bathing. Each 
blue, red, green, or black line shows the mean difference between arms for all four variables for one potential realized randomization. The results show that a few randomizations, in blue, are relatively imbalanced on volume and outcome but balanced on chlorhexidine use and bathing, while a few others, in black, have the reverse pattern. The green and red realizations are approximately equally balanced across these variables. If we considered it more important to balance on volume and outcome, this would probably not be an ideal 
scheme.  
 
Figure 2.  
 
 
As a final note, we could consider the relative costs and benefits of strata of four, rather than tuplets, 
which are strata of two. There are sound statistical reasons to expect power to be slightly better with strata of 
four, although there is some debate on this point.   However, the balance between the arms may be worse. The 
balance is of central importance, since balance ensures that the observed effect is not confounded—confounding requires that the confounder be out of balance between the arms. We will examine whether the

specific automated pharmacy reports for administration of either product. Compliance will be assessed and fed 
back to unit champi[INVESTIGATOR_554903] -monthly coaching calls with a goal of 85% compliance, a level we have 
previously achieved in this population. Periodic maintenance reminders will be provided in both arms and will 
reflect common lapses identified by [CONTACT_554930].  
Study investigators will perform site visits as needed to various participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554904], concerns about application of intervention protocols, or evidence of low compliance. These procedures are comparable to those used by [CONTACT_554931]. Oversight for the design and conduct of this trial will be provided by [CONTACT_40972] (see 
above), which will meet weekly.  
 
1.2.8 Nasal Iodophor  
Nasal iodophor will be used for the nasal decolonization regimen for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554874] 2 
(Iodophor arm), using Clorox Nasal Antiseptic Swabs, a 10% povidone- iodine product. This product is FDA 
cleared for use in the nose and the manufacturer has released guidance for routine use for decolonization. Thus, the use of povidone-iodine swabs in the Swap Out Trial is to apply one swab in a circular motion to each nostril for 30 seconds, twice daily for 5 days.   
Clorox Nasal Antiseptic Swabs has a separate set of directions for pre-operative nasal decolonization, 
which continues to use double the dose for a one -time application. Participating sites will be trained to ensure 
that they are aware of the differences in manufacturer guidance for routine ICU decolonization vs pre-operative indications which requires application of two swabs per nostril.   
1.2.9 Likelihood of Study -Related Events 
Regarding safety, we note that 10% iodophor  has been the national standard of care for pre-surgical 
preparation for surgery for decades, including on mucous membranes of the nose and throat. It is also used for 
nasal decolonization prior to joint surgery, where it has been shown to be better tolerated than mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190].
[ADDRESS_728663] dye where an 
iodine-containing substance is injected directly into the bloodstream. This type of adverse event carries a 1% risk for direct injection into the bloodstream and is exceedingly rare in the use of iodophor for mucous 
membranes (so rare that estimates of frequency are not available). 
In addition, as part of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_554905], povidone-iodine nasal antiseptic swabs 
were applied to residents in three southern [LOCATION_004] nursing homes for 6 months. Two swabs were applied in a circular motion to each nostril, twice daily for 5 days every other week (total of 13 weeks of application to residents). Accounting for facility census and protocol adherence, a total of 22,[ADDRESS_728664] from 3M, which was 5% povidone iodine swabs (also FDA cleared for nasal use).  
After the above pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], as part of routine quality improvement, one of the nursing homes continued the 
use of nasal iodophor, but changed to a 10% povidone-iodine product (Clorox) and used one swab per nostril per application instead of [ADDRESS_728665] on nasal decolonization of S. aureus was similar between the prior 5% povidone-iodine two-swab regimen and the 10% one-swab povidone-iodine swab regimen. Nasal and skin cultures were taken from residents confirmed nearly identical reductions in MRSA with the 5% povidone-iodine two-swab regimen and the 10% one-swab povidone-iodine swab regimen.

 1.2.10 Monitoring Study-Related Events 
 To monitor the occurrence of study -related events, a Study -Related Events Submission Form will be 
provided to Arm 2 facilities to document all events possibly  related to use of iodophor, as part of study 
procedures. Clinical staff wil l be required to provide specific details regarding the event such as the body parts 
affected, the agent related to the event, a description of the reaction, and the corrective action that was taken 
to resolve the event. Clinical staff will be instructed to report all events to their designated nurse manager or director who will securely fax Study -Related Event Forms (iodophor). All clinical decision-making related to 
study related events will be at the discretion of the treating physician, not trial investigators or study staff, as is 
routine for quality improvement protocols.  
Facilities will be asked to submit Study -Related Event Submission Forms as events are found. We will 
use our regular trial coaching calls to prompt facilities to report on schedule. Call attendance will be tracked. In 
the event that a facility is unable to attend, study staff will follow up to obtain a status update. A database will be used to document reported study -related events that take place in participating facilities. This tool will 
enable the project staff to closely track and assess any events deemed to be associated with the trial. The user will be able to document specific details regarding the event, and it will allow the user to keep a case open if the event is ongoing or  close a case if the event is resolved.  
Additionally, a Side-Effects Form for mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-related events will be provided to Arm 1 facilities . 
Clinical staff at Arm 1 facilities will be asked to document and report all events possibly related to use of 
mupi [INVESTIGATOR_19190], providing the same type of information as requested in the iodophor form . While nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554906], this information is requested so that the frequency and severity of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-related 
events can be compared to that of iodophor.  
 
1.2.11 Outcomes  
Individual level data from patients in all participating ICUs will be obtained from the HCA corporate data 
warehouse, including demographics, census  (including ICU patient days), bathing queries, pharmacy ( nasal 
decolonization product administration), diagnostic and procedure codes (enabling comorbidity score 
assessment) , and microbiology testing results.  
The primary outcome will be  S. aureus  clinical cultures (MRSA and MSSA) attributed to the 
participating ICU (>2 days into the ICU stay until  2 days after ICU discharge). Secondary outcomes intended 
for primary manuscript, include: 1) ICU -attributable MRSA clinical cultures, 2) ICU -attributable all -cause 
bloodstream infection.

1.2.12 Data Collection 
Descriptive data, outcome data and variables for addressing confounding will be derived from 
microbiology, census, pharmacy, and claims data from participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The following data elements will 
be collected (Table 6) using encrypted study IDs.

(e.g. Elixhauser score) as well as evaluating the individual components of that score (e.g. diabetes, renal

 1.2.13 Statistical Analysis and Power  
The primary analysis will be an as -randomized proportional hazards model  to evaluate for noninferiority 
at a margin of 10% (difference in relative hazard) . Model terms will include arm, period (baseline vs. 
intervention) and an arm by [CONTACT_554932]. Clustering within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554908], i.e., a random intercept for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and, if it should become 
technologically feasible, an additional random intercept for each ICU within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554909].   
• Null hypothesis (H
0): the change in relative hazard of clinical culture of S. aureus  in the 
Iodophor -CHG arm is higher than (inferior to) the change in the Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-CHG arm by [CONTACT_26813] 10%  
• Alternative hypothesis (H 1): the change in relative hazard of clinical culture of S. aureus  in the 
Iodophor -CHG arm is higher than (inferior to) the Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-CHG arm by 10% or less  
 
Phase-in period data will not be included in the analysis.  
To be expli
cit, the primary  analysis will take the form of 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) =𝜆𝜆0(𝑡𝑡)𝑒𝑒𝛽𝛽1𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽2𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽3𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∗𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖  
where 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) is the time 𝑡𝑡 of the S. aureus  clinical culture for person 𝑗𝑗 at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 𝑖𝑖. The baseline hazard 
function for time 𝑡𝑡, 𝜆𝜆0(𝑡𝑡), is shared by [CONTACT_554933]; 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖is the frailty shared by [CONTACT_554934][INVESTIGATOR_307] 𝑖𝑖. The linear 
predictor in the exponent functions as in a linear model, where 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates the treatment arm of person 𝑗𝑗 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 𝑖𝑖 is the iodophor arm, and 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates that person 𝑗𝑗 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 𝑖𝑖 was se en in the intervention 
period. Thus 𝛽𝛽3 is the estimated differential effect of iodophor relative to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554910]. While software is currently not able to include frailties for multiple visits per person or for 
multiple ICUs per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554911], we will include them if this should become possible by [CONTACT_554935].  
 The prim
ary outcome of the trial is ICU-attributable S. aureus  clinical cultures (MRSA + MSSA) wh ere 
ICU-attributable is defined as S. aureus  cultures occurring in specimens collected from study cohort patients 
from the 3rd day of an ICU stay through 2 days after ICU discharge. This outcome will be assessed using an 
as-randomized unadjusted proportional hazards model as described above with two-sided significance set at 
alpha = 0.05, consistent with FDA standards of non-inferiority ( https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -
information/search-fda- guidance-documents/non-inferiority -clinical -trials ). The pre-specified non -inferiority 
margin, we repeat, is 10%.  
 There is reason to suspect that nasal iodophor may be inferior to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554912] S. aureus , which is the reason for the non-inferiority trial. 
However, conversely, if iodophor is found to be non-inferior, we are declaring the a priori intent to assess for superiority because of evi dence of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]-resistant S. aureus  strains where none is expected to exist for 
iodophor. For this reason, if iodophor is found to be non-inferior in the primary outcome of the trial, we will also report the pre-specified assessment of superiority which is already performed in the primary analysis.  
 Secondary non-inferiority outcomes include 1) ICU -attributable MRSA clinical cultures and 2) ICU -
attributable all -cause bloodstream infection. These will be assessed using an as -randomized unadjusted 
proporti onal hazards model as described above.  We will use two-sided significance tests set at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_728667] possible sensitivity, again with a non-inferiority margin of 10% . Due to the above antibiotic -resistance rationale to suspect possible superiority, if non-inferiority

significance set at alpha = 0.025, which accounts for the multiple comparisons of two outcomes. To be clear, the non-inferiority tests are not adjusted for multiple testing, while the superiority tests, if they are performed, will be adjusted for multiple testing, for conservatism.

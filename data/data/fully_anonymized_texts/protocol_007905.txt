Introduction  
Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age- related macular degeneration (AMD) for which 
there is currently no available tr eatment.  Damage to the retina secondary to oxidative stress is thought to 
be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of GA.1-3  Recently, the Dunaief Lab at the University of 
Pennsylvania has found that alpha lipoic acid (ALA), a potent antioxidant and i ron chelator, is extremely 
retina- protective in a light damage mouse model.4 ALA, a naturally occurring substance made by [CONTACT_165626], is an excellent candidate drug because it has proven to be safe and effective during decades of use 
for the treatment of dia betic peripheral neuropathy.5-8 The objective of this study is to determine the 
effects of ALA on the progression of GA in patients with AMD through a Phase II clinical trial.  The central 
hypothesis is that oral ALA supplementation reduces the rate of enl argement of GA in AMD patients.  The 
rationale is that the antioxidant and iron chelating effects of A LA will slow down one of the major 
pathways responsible for GA progression.   
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex, degenerative, and progressive eye disease that 
can result in severe loss of central vision. It is the leading cause of blindness among those 60 years or 
older in the Western hemisphere.9-10 Geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of AMD, is  responsible 
for approximately 20% of the legal blindness cases in North America.1 Based on [LOCATION_002] 
(US) Census Bureau data from the year 2000  and AREDS (Age Related Eye Disease Study) data, there 
are at least an estimated 824,[ADDRESS_1266042] 8 million individuals in the US with monocular or binocular 
intermediate AMD or monocular advanced AMD, and thus at risk for  progression to advanced AMD in one 
of their eyes.   The major mechanisms involved in AMD progression include oxidative stress, inflammation 
with abnormalities in the complement system, accumulation of lipid peroxidation end products, and the 
production of other toxic metabolic by[CONTACT_902684].1,12-15 Iron potentially contributes to 
the oxidative damage seen in AMD.16-18 
 
AMD is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the macula, leading to a severe decrease in 
central vision.  An early sign of AMD is the appearance of drusen, which are yellow, extracellular deposits 
that accumulate below the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE) and are known to be risk factors for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] c horoidal  neovascularization (CNV).  Depending on the number and size of drusen at the 
macula, a subject may be categorized as intermediate AMD.19 Some of these subjects may progress to 
advanced AMD.  There are two types of advanced AMD: GA and exudative (neovascular) AMD.  GA can 
be defined as on e or more well -defined, more or less circular patches of loss of the RPE, typi[INVESTIGATOR_902670].  GA can be multifocal or unifocal.  Areas of GA are 
atrophic, nonfunctioning retina, and each area of GA leads to a scotoma in the subject’s visual field.  
Exudative AMD is defined as the presence of abnormal vessels, refer red to as choroidal 
neovascularization, under the retina or retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836].  These vessels can leak fluid and 
bleed, leading to acute and severe vision loss.  The current standard- of-care treatment of exudative AMD 
is intravitreal injection the rapy with anti -VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents.20 For eyes with 
geographic atrophy, 2 – 18% may develop CNV over the course of two years, and CNV in the fellow eye 
is a risk factor for this development.[ADDRESS_1266043]  
Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is also known as thioctic acid.  Placebo product is also used in this study.  ALA is 
a potent antioxidant that was approved many years ago in [LOCATION_013] for the treatment of diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy.5-8 ALA is created endogenously by [CONTACT_902685].  It is available in the diet 
through potatoes, spi[INVESTIGATOR_87957], broccoli, tomatoes, peas, brussel sprouts, and rice bran.31 It can already be 
purchased as an over -the-counter supplement and is manufactured by [CONTACT_902686].  ALA is an 
important cofactor for mitochondrial enzyme complexes and is involved in the metabolic process that 
converts carbohydrates into energy.32 The functions of ALA also include the restoration of diminished 
levels of other antioxidants , acting as a potent chelator of metal ions such as iron, stimulating glucose 
uptake, and increasing insulin sensitivity.32  
1.2.1  Nonclinical Data  
Recently, the Dunaief Lab of the University of Pennsylvania found that ALA, a potent antioxidant and iron 
chelator , is extremely retina -protective in a light damage mouse model.4  While there is no animal model 
that exactly replicates GA from AMD, the mouse model of light -induced retinal degeneration is a good 
model for studying the development of retinal atrophy.  The Dunaief Lab found that intraperitoneal ALA given daily at 100 mg/kg had a significant protective effect in a mouse model of light -induced retinal 
degeneration. ALA, a naturally occurring substance made by [CONTACT_10489], is an excellent candidate drug because it has proven to be safe and effective during decades of use for the treatment of diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy.
5-[ADDRESS_1266044] of these published studies on the 
safety and tolerability of ALA at doses of 1200 mg or higher involve adults that are not elderly.  
1.2.3      Human Ph armacokinetics  
ALA is both water and fat -soluble.  Importantly, it is known to cross the blood- brain barrier and is 
therefore capable of reaching the target ocular tissues.40-41 There are two enantiomers (R and S) of ALA, 
and the R form is the naturally occur ring form.[ADDRESS_1266045] used the racemic form of ALA 
and biological activity has been shown with oral ingestion of the racemic form.5,36,43 When the oral form is 
ingested, gastrointestinal absorption is roughly 30%.[ADDRESS_1266046] reported 
pharm acokinetic data on oral, racemic ALA from different companies, including ALA from Pure 
Encapsulations (Sudbury, MA), a subsidiary of Atrium Innovations Inc. (Westmount, Canada).  They

ingestion.35,42 Peak levels in the cortex, retina, and optic nerve are achieved around the same time.45-46 
Doses of 600 mg twice daily led to median serum levels of 0.2 µg/mL (range 0 -  3.7 µg/mL), while median 
serum levels of A LA after placebo ingestion were negligible (all values < 1 µg/mL).36 Doses of 1200 mg 
daily or twice daily led to median serum levels of 4.8 µg/mL (range 0 –  19 µg/mL).  When taking 1200 mg 
daily, blood levels of ALA are undetectable approximately 5 hours after ingestion.35  
1.3 Dose Rationale  
The Dunaief Lab found that intraperitoneal ALA given daily at 100 mg/kg had a significant protective 
effect in a mouse model of light -induced retinal degeneration.[ADDRESS_1266047] shown oral ALA at similar 
doses to be protective of retinal ganglion cells in a mouse model of glaucoma.45 Yadav et al. found that 
subcutaneous injections of ALA at 50 mg/kg/day was an effective dose at suppressing experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice.  They then found that [ADDRESS_1266048] ( Phase  
1). In Phase  1, doses of [ADDRESS_1266049] safety/tolerability data for higher doses of A LA is not specific to 
the elderly population.  Once the first Phase is complete a r andomized, double- blind placebo controlled 
trial (Phase 2) will be conducted.  In Phase 2, doses of 1200mg will be administered to subjects for [ADDRESS_1266050] tolerable dose will be used.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
The objective of Phase  1 of this protocol is to determine if doses of 600 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg of ALA 
are well -tolerated in the elderly population as each dose is taken for 5 days.   
 
The objective of Phase  2 of this protocol is to determine the effects of ALA on the progres sion of GA in 
subjec ts with AMD .  The central hypothesis, based on the existing literature, is that oral ALA reduces the 
rate of enlargement of GA in AMD subjects.  The rationale is that the antioxidant and iron chelating 
effects of ALA will slow down one of the major pathways responsible for GA progression.   
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to investigate ALA’s effect on the rate of change over time (18 months) in area of 
GA in the study eye, as determined by [CONTACT_902687] .  The primary 
endpoint will be determined using fundus autofluorescence (FAF).  The study  will utilize the  Scheie Eye 
Institute  Reading Center  to grade the photographs .

• Rate of change over time (18 months  from the time of randomization) in area of GA in the study 
eye as measured on color fundus photos.  
• Absolute and relative change in area of GA as measured on color fundus photos

OCT  and change in the number of drusen seen on color fundus photos ; 2) Change in score on the Ocular  
Surface Disease Index (OSDI)47;3) Change in best distance corrected near visual acuity.  
 
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
 
Phase  1: Dose tolerability test  
This is a  single site dose tolerability test . We plan to enroll 15 subjects (ages 65- 90) in a single site drug 
tolerability test. Each enrolled subject will take [ADDRESS_1266053] will then take 8 00 mg of oral ALA once daily with a m eal for 5 additional days.  
If 800 mg of oral ALA is well -tolerated, then subjects will then take 1200 mg of oral ALA once daily with a 
meal for 5 days.  
 
Phase  2: Randomized, double -blind placebo controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_902671] , we plan to enroll 50 subjects into a randomized, double-
blind, placebo- controlled trial.  Subjects will be randomized (1:1) into one of two study arms : placebo 
capsules and ALA [ADDRESS_1266054] tolerable dose will be 
used.  Four  clinical sites  are planned and the enrollment period is estimated to be 12 months.  The 
primary endpoint is the mean rate  of change of the area of GA in the study eye from baseline to 18 
months (from the time of randomization) as evaluated by [CONTACT_737286].  Subjects will have a 
refracted electronic visual acuity and dilated exam at baseline, [ADDRESS_1266055] (Phase 1), [ADDRESS_1266056].  The 15 subjects will receive the ALA after 
consenting to the tolerability study at the Scheie Eye Institute of the University of Pennsylvania.  
 
Phase 2 
Screening/Run- In Phase  
After the clinician determines the patient meets preliminary eligibility  for the trial and the patient signs  the 
consent form, the screening data will be entered into the d ata management system.   Coordinating Center 
staff will verify the patient is eligible for the study;  correction or confirmation will be performed as 
needed.    The Clinical and Scien tific Expert and the Scheie Eye Institute Reading Center will also review 
the patient’s information and retinal images to confirm eligibility prior to randomization  and complete a 
form confirming eligibility that is entered into the data management system.    
 At the screening visit, all subjects will be provided with a postage- paid mailing envelope.  Those subjects  
that do not meet i nclusion and exclusion criteria will be contact[CONTACT_902688].  Those subjects  that are meeting inclusion and exclusion  criteria will be 
instructed to start the [ADDRESS_1266057] is not informed of whether the study capsules for the run- in phase are 
placebo or ALA.

Subjects who demonstrate compliance by [CONTACT_41680] ≥ 80% of the provided capsules and mailing the 
medication bottle within [ADDRESS_1266058] been met . Coordinating Center staff 
will issue the next  randomized treatment assignment from the clinical site’s schedule for the patient  .  A 
Coordinating Center staff member notifies the clinical  site Investigator   that the randomization has been 
completed and the Investigator will fax/send a prescription for study medication (ALA or placebo) , signed 
by [CONTACT_902689]- Investigator , to the University of Pennsylvania’s Investigational Drug Service  
(IDS) . A Coordinating Center staff member will notify IDS of the treatment assignment.    
 
Once IDS receives both the  prescription from the Investigator and the treatment assignment from the 
Coordinating Center , IDS will  send a supply of study drug to the subject’s home.   Subsequent study 
medication also will be mailed by [CONTACT_902690]’s home.  
 For both study Phases, p rior to starting the medication, the subject will be instructed on how to take the 
medication,  and what signs and symptoms to monitor  and report .  For Phase  [ADDRESS_1266059] is taking the study medication per instructions . 
3.2 Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
For Phase  1 of this protocol, the primary endpoint is the percent of adverse events that develop in the 
study group.   
 
For Phase  2 of this protocol, t he prim ary endpoint  is the rate of change over time (18 months  from the 
time of randomization) in area of GA in the study eye . This is determined by [CONTACT_902691] , in 
participants randomized to placebo or [ADDRESS_1266060] of ALA on the following:  
• Absolute and relative change in area of GA as measured on FAF  
• Rate of change over time (18 months from the time of randomization) in area of GA in the 
study eye as measured on  color fundus photos  
• Absolute and relative change in area of GA as measured on color fundus photos   
• Ocular safety outcomes of ALA as indicated by [CONTACT_574624], development of 
uveitis, or any other ocular changes not consistent with the natural progression of GA  
 
The following exploratory endpoint s will be of interest to the study:   1) Change in drusen volume based on 
OCT  and change in the amount of drusen on color fundus photos ; 2) Change in score on the Ocular 
Surface Disease Index (OSDI) .47; 3) Change in best distance corrected near visual acuity.

No vulnerable populations will be involved with this study.  
5 Study Intervention  
Please refer to sections 6.2 . 
5.1 Description  of study medication  
Study  medication is comprised of ALA 600mg capsules  or placebo capsules . 
5.2 Intervention Regimen  
Subjects will take one 600mg capsule of ALA (or placebo)  once daily with a meal for 2 weeks and then 
increase to two 600 mg capsules of ALA (or placebo)  once daily with a meal for the remainder of the  [ADDRESS_1266071]  (Phase 1), see section 3.1.1.   The [ADDRESS_1266072] of two 400 
mg capsules of ALA.   
5.3 Receipt  
The ALA is provided by [CONTACT_550788] (Sudbury, MA).  It is received, stored, handled, and 
distributed to investigators by [CONTACT_537272].  
5.[ADDRESS_1266073]’s home by [CONTACT_537272].  All drugs (active drug 
and placebo)  must be stored at room temperature.   
5.5 Preparation and Packaging  
In order to maintain the study blind, the Perelman Sch ool of Medicine Investigational Drug Service (IDS) 
will manufacture a placebo capsule to match the active ALA 600mg capsule provided by [CONTACT_902694].   A white, semi -opaque Size 0 pharm aceutical grade capsule shell will be filled with a 
combinati on of microcrystalline cellulose NF (approximately 600mg) plus trace amounts of coloring 
agents in order to closely mimic the appearance of the powder inside the active ALA capsule.   Both 
placebo and ALA will be light yellow.  
 For dispensing, capsules will  be hand- counted and placed into white opaque Type 2 HDPE

and has no young children living at home.   Bottles will include labeling compliant with  FDA regulation, [ADDRESS_1266075] information 
onto the drug inventory logs.  The Investigational Drug Service provides an  “ALA for GA Study Medication 
Ordering, Distribution, and Accountability Manual” to each clinical center.  Outdated supplies will be 
recalled by [CONTACT_902695].  
 
At each vis it after the baseline visit  and when run- in bottles are returned, unused study drug will be 
collected.  Returned drug must be stored in the returned bottle in a secured location.  The date the bottles 
are returned are noted on a drug accountability log.  
 
All drug storage facilities and medication dispensing and collection records will be made available for  
inspection.

In Phase 2, subject s will be contact[CONTACT_902696] a follow up visit within the week of the 
appointment.  The contact [CONTACT_902697] a subject  response is necessary.  To ensure 
subject  compliance for scheduled visit s, early morning, evening,  or weekend hours may be provided.  
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_902698] s, even if they do not want 
to return to be examined or follow the protocol.   After s ubject s enrolled in Phase [ADDRESS_1266077]  cannot tolerate the study medication (ALA or placebo) because of gastric reflux or symptoms 
thought to be from gastric reflux, they will be encouraged to prevent their symptoms by [CONTACT_902699] -
the-counter gastrointestinal medication for reflux such as r anitidine or omeprazole.  The investigator will 
make the determination that the symptoms are consistent with reflux and make the recommendation for 
gastrointestinal prophylaxis on a case- by-case basis.  The investigator may choose to involve an internist 
in making this decision.  Any us e of gastrointestinal prophylaxis medications  will be recorded.  If ranitidine 
is desired to treat such symptoms at no cost to the subject because of reflux presumed to be related to 
the study medication, then a prescription may be sent (fax/email) to the UPenn IDS and the ranitidine will 
be mailed to the subject.  The study’s Clinical and Scientific Expert must be notified and approve of this 
action within one week and prior to sending the ranitidine prescription to the Penn IDS. 
 
If a subject cannot tolerate the study medication (ALA or placebo) for the reasons detailed below, then the 
subject will be asked if he/she is willing to take one capsule twice daily instead of two capsules once 
daily:  
• there are uncomfortable gastroi ntestinal symptoms that do not resolve with medication for reflux,  
• there are gastrointestinal symptoms and the subject does not want to take any prophylactic 
gastrointestinal medication, or

If the subject cannot tolerate or does not want to take one capsule twice daily, then the subject will be 
asked if he/she is willing to take one capsule once daily.  If the subject cannot tolerate one capsule once daily or does not want to take one capsule once daily, then the subject will be asked to at least remain in 
the study.  All changes to the schedule of study medication dosing will be documented.  
 The study subjects will be asked to provide urine samples at the [ADDRESS_1266078]’s compliance.  The samples will be tested in the

the provided capsules and mailing the medication bottle within [ADDRESS_1266091] by [CONTACT_902704] (see section 3.1.1 Allocation to Intervention Group).   If an 
investigator did not receive a mailed medication bottle but believes the subject followed instructions and 
the medication bott le was lost in the mail, then that subject may get screened again for the study. In this 
instance, the subject will have to repeat the screening visit and the run- in period.

capsules will be notified within two weeks that they cannot continue in the study and that they received 
placebo capsules during the Run- In.  Subjects that continue to randomization will be informed after the 
study is completed that they received placebo capsules for the Run- In and whether they were randomized 
to placebo or ALA.  
After signing the informed consent document and within [ADDRESS_1266092] and FAF images will all be collected at enrollment (baseline), 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_1266093] images will be submitted to the Scheie Image Reading Center at enrollment

7.2.[ADDRESS_1266096] -Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)/Refraction  (Distance Measurement)  
BCVA measurement should be performed on both eyes using the Electronic ETDRS (E -ETDRS) Visual 
Acuity Testing Protocol.[ADDRESS_1266097] Distance- Corrected Near Visual Acuity (Near Measurement)  
In order  to evaluate the potential of ALA to improve presby[CONTACT_19555], a distance- corrected near visual acuity 
will be measured with a near vision ETDRS  style chart.  Using the distance correction  (based on 
refraction) , the near visual acuity will be measured for each eye with the near vision chart held at 16 
inches (40 cm) .  This should be done regardless of the eye being phakic or pseudophakic.  
    
Ophthalmoscopic Examination  
Intraocular pressures (IOP) will be measured at each study visit.  Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_902676] 2.5% Neo- Synephrine and 1% Mydriacyl, or equivalent.  A complete anterior and posterior segment slit 
lamp exam will be performed by [CONTACT_902705] a lens assessment.  This will 
be done with both a slit lamp and dilated ophthalmoscopy.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1266098]  will be entered into the Heidelberg Spectralis 
machine.  From the keratometry measurements, the average keratometry reading (K) for each eye is 
calculated [(K1 + K2)/2].  Then, the corneal radius of curvature (mm) can be calculated using the formula 
Page 16 of 32 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   and the average K measurement : r = 337.5/K .  Keratometry measurements will be re- measured and 
updated wi thin the Spectralis if a subject  has had any ophthalmic surgery or history of c orneal suture 
removal since the last study visit.  
 
Fundus Photography  
A photographic field between [ADDRESS_1266099] fields 
1, 2 and modified 3 will be obtained. Photographs from baseline, months 6, 12, and 18 will be read by [CONTACT_902706].   Fundus photos should be acquired 
before fundus autofluorescence images are acquired.  
 
 
 
  
Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)  
All OCT images from enrollment (baseline) and months 6, 12, and 18 months will be read by [CONTACT_902707].  These images will be acquired with the Heidelberg 
Spectralis (Carlsbad, CA).   
 
 
  
Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF)  
The areas of geographic atrophy  will be evaluated from FAF images taken with the Heidelberg Spectralis 
(Carlsbad,  CA) using the Blue Peak Blue Laser Autof luorescence mode.   The FAF images should be 
taken after the color fundus photos and OCT imaging.   
 
All FAF images from enrollment (baseline) and months 6, 12, and 18 will be read by [CONTACT_902708].  
 
 
 
 
 
Geographic Atrophy  
Geographic atrophy (GA) will be assessed from the color fundus photographs and FAF images. On color 
photographs, GA is observed as one of more sharply defined, more or less circular patches of absence of 
the R PE, typi[INVESTIGATOR_488621]. At a minimum, at least two 
of the aforementioned  characteristics (sharp edges, more or less circular shape and visibility of 
underlying choroidal vessels) with a minimum size of ≥ [ADDRESS_1266100]  linear dimension are 
required for a lesion to be categorized as GA.49 While a minimum size of ≥ [ADDRESS_1266101]  linear 
dimension is required for a lesion to be categorized as GA for grading once an eye is in the study , the GA 
size requirements for study eye inclusion stated in section 4.2.1 (Inclusion Criteria) still stand.  
 
Once geographic atrophy has been identified on the color photographs and FAF by [CONTACT_488659], the grader 
will use the Region Finder semi -automated sof tware of the Heidelberg Spectralis to measure the areas of 
geographic atrophy at the macula of the study eye.  While the color photographs are used to categorize a 
lesion as GA, the primary measure of GA area will be taken from the FAF images.  The color photos can 
also be used to assist in the interpretation of the FAF images.  GA appears as well defined 
hypoautofluorescent patches in FAF images.  All areas of GA at the macula of the study eye will be 
measured.

that ophthalmologist .  At the next scheduled study visit, any adverse events related to the need for the 
unscheduled visits will be recorded.  If there is a significant change in exam or a new diagnosis noted at the time of the unscheduled visit (i.e. new choroidal neovascularization, retinal vein or artery occlusion, vitreous hemorrhage, etc. ), the Sponsor will be notified   
7.[ADDRESS_1266104] for their continued eye care.  
8 Statistical Plan  
8.1 Primary Endpoint
 
For Phase  1 of this protocol, the primary endpoint is the percent of adverse events that develop in the 
study group  at each studied dose of ALA .   
 
For Phase  2 of this protocol, t he primary endpoint is the mean rate of change of the area of GA in the 
study eye from baseline to 18 months  (from the time of randomization)  as evaluat ed by [CONTACT_814937].  
8.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 A secondary endpoint for Phase I is the percent of subjects that think they could tolerat e each studied 
dose of ALA for a duration of 18 months.  If 4 or more (out of 15) subjects state that they could not imagine taking a particular dose for 18 months, then that dose will not be used in the Phase 2 Trial.  
 The secondary endpoints for Phase  2 include:  
• The change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to 18 months  from the time of 
randomization  
Page 18 of 32 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   • The proportion of subjects with three lines or more worsening in BCVA  
• Absolute and relative change in area of GA as measured on FAF  
• Rate of  change over time (18 months  from the time of randomization) in area of GA in the study 
eye as measured on color fundus photos.  
• Absolute and relative change in area of GA as measured on color fundus photos  
• Change in drusen volume based on OCT and change in the number of drusen seen on color 
fundus photos  (exploratory endpoint)  
• Change in score on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)47 (exploratory endpoint)  
• Change in best distance corrected near visual acuity (exploratory endpoint)  
 
• Ocular and systemic safety outcomes for these doses of ALA  
8.3 Sample Size and Power Determination  
Phase 1: It is ex pected that a sample size of 15 subjects will adequately determine if there is a significant 
intolerance of the tested doses of ALA in the elderly population.   
 
Phase 2:  In addition to assessing the safety profile of ALA and the feasibility of study procedures, one of 
the major goals of the proposed study is to determine if additional, larger scale assessments of efficacy 
are warranted.   For pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], it is appropriate to use a confidence interval approach to evaluate 
outcomes and pre- specify a clinically important threshold to determine if further investigation is justified.50-
51 If we decide to halt investigation if the observed growth rate in the actively treated group is greater than 
in the placebo group, then it is reasonable to use a one- sided confidence interval.   With 50 total 
subjects,  we can be 90% confident (one- sided)  that the “effect size”  of ALA in reducing the GA growth 
rate  is 0.4 or less.   This num ber assumes that 15% of subjects  dropout.   An example of an effect size of 
0.4 would be a growth rate of 0.40 mm in the placebo group and a growth rate of 0.32 (20% reduc tion) in 
the ALA group when the standard deviation of the annual growth rate is 0.20 mm.52 Interventions with 
less efficacy than this may not be worth pursuing. 
 Based on current data, it is possible that approximately 25% of subjects randomized to the ALA  arm may 
not tolerate [ADDRESS_1266105] enrolled in the study, we will perform interim analyses of the numbers of subjects  in these 
subgroups without evaluating any outcomes data.  Depending on the status of enrollment, drop- out rates, 
and the size of the subgroup consistently taking 1200 mg subgroup, the study sample size may be 
increased at this time so that the 1200 mg subgroup has a number equal to or nearly equal to 22 subjects 
available for analyses.  
8.4 Statistical Methods  
Phase 1: Percentages  of adverse events will be calculated.  
 
Phase 2: As a preliminary analysis, t he mean change in the total area of GA within study eyes over 18 
months  (from the time of randomization)  will be compared between eyes  receiving the active ALA dose 
and placebo supplementation; a square root transformation will be applied to the area measurements to 
mitigate the dependence of growth rate on initial s ize.53-54 Also, m ean change in visual acuity over 18 
months, the proportion with a decrease of 15 letters (3 lines) of visual acuity, and the proportions with 
serious adverse events will also be compared. Variants of the independent t -test and chi -square t ests of 
proportions that account for the correlation between eyes of subjects who have two study eyes will be used to make comparisons.   
 
The main analysis for comparing treatment groups will compare the rates of change in total area of GA 
using a mixed ef fects linear model.  Use of this model allows including all patients in  the analysis and  
requires less stringent assumptions than a complete cases analysis regarding the association of

parameter as a “last observation carried forward (LOCF)” approach does when area changes with time.  
Both subject and eye will be considered random effects.  A sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation  
for missing values w ill be used for the analysis of mean change between baseline and [ADDRESS_1266106] descriptive statistics (including 
mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for 
categorical variables such as gender).  
8.4.2  Safety Analysis  
Phase 1: All subjects entered into the study will have detailed information collected on adverse events for 
the overall study safety analysis.   Symptoms reported will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe in 
nature.   
 
Phase 2: All subjects entered into the study and randomized at the baseline visit will have detailed 
information collected on adverse events for the overall study safety analysis

9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with t he use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.   Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be 
adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with new clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372] 
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that results 
in any of the following outcomes :  
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions. Example,  loss of 6 lines of visual acuity on the ETDRS chart  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect

will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoi ng at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be 
recorded a nd reported immediately.  
9.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
Princip al Investigator s will determine the relationship of each adverse event to the study procedures or 
study drug.  The relationship will be classified as any of the following:  
• Definitely related  
• Prob ably related  
• Possibly related  
• Unlikely or unrelated  
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
The Data Coordinating Center  receives notification of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) via a specific form 
completed by [CONTACT_902709] 24 hours .  An assessment of all incoming SAEs is 
made to determine whether the event needs to be reported to the FDA.  The Coordinating Center sends 
an electronic copy of each Serious Adverse Event Report Form, as well as baseline medical history, 
medications reported at baseline and follow -up, and other supporting documentation as needed  to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours .  The Coordinating Center al so sends all AEs to the Sponsor .  All SAEs are 
reviewed by [CONTACT_902710].   
9.4.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Any serious adverse event will be reported to the study S ponsor within 24 hours of the event.  To report 
such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator and sent to the 
Sponsor , via the Data Coordinating Center,  within 24 hours.  The I nvestigator will keep a copy of each 
SAE form on file at the study site.  Report serious adverse events to: 
 Clinical Trials Coordinating Center  
Center for Preventive Ophthalmology and Biostat istics  
[ADDRESS_1266108]  
Philadelphia, PA.   [ZIP_CODE]- 3309  
[PHONE_18709]  
[PHONE_18710] (fax)  
 
Within the following [ADDRESS_1266109] the understanding of the event.  Significant new information for ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the study sponsor.  
9.4.2  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the local  IRB  
Each Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_902677]/her  IRB’s reporting requirements.  The University of 
Pennsylvania Investigator  will report AEs at least annually to the University of Pennsylvania IRB.  
Investigat ors will promptly report any unexpected and related AEs to the IRB, including suspected 
adverse reactions. Other prompt reporting requirements will include: changes, violation, or deviation to 
the protocol without prior IRB and Sponsor review to eliminate immediate hazard to a study subject, 
complaint of a subject when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved 
by [CONTACT_5051], breach of confidentiality, and premature completion of the study. For the UPenn 
site, a n unanticipated problem that includes risk to other subjects must be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1266110] 
submit  a report to the UPenn IRB within 3 days.  
9.4.3  Sponsor repor ting: Notifying the FDA   
This protocol is being conducted under an FDA IND . The Sponsor will  report all adverse events to the 
FDA in the Annual Report and all unanticipated, related and serious adverse events to the FDA  per 
regulation.  
9.4.4  Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators  
In addition to reporting to the FDA, the Sponsor shares  SAEs with participating Investigators.  
9.[ADDRESS_1266111] can be provided 
document ation of whether he/she received placebo or ALA within [ADDRESS_1266112].  
9.6 Monitoring  
9.6.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 Phase 1: After a subject has taken a study dose for [ADDRESS_1266113] will stop participation in the study at that point.  If 
after review of the adverse event(s) (and their quality) that a subject experienced at a particular dose, then the study physician also may stop the subject's participation in the study if their is any safety concern.  If 4 or more (out of 15) subjects state that they could not imagine taking a particular dose for 18 
months, then that dose will not be used in the Phase 2 Trial.   Adverse events, the severity of adverse 
events, and the percent of subjects that think they could tak e a particular dose of ALA for 18 months will 
be reported to the University of Pennsylvania IRB before proceeding with Phase 2.   A Data and Safety 
Monitor (DSM) will also independently review all adverse events as outlined in the DSM Charter.  
 Phase 2: While each Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_902678], there 
will also be a  Data and Safety Monitor (DSM).  Review of known risks from ALA has suggested that ALA 
is relatively safe and well tolerated (see Section 1.2.2).A Drug Safety Monitoring Plan has been developed based on risk.   
[ADDRESS_1266114] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will hav e access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator,  by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
Page [ADDRESS_1266115] vit al status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
10.2 Data Collection and Management  
Phase 1: For the ALA tolerability test, data will be entered onto case report forms by [CONTACT_941] R esearch 
Coordinator or P hysician Investigator .  There will be no electronic records for the tolerability test.  
 
Phase 2: Data will be directly collected onto case report forms in real time by [CONTACT_1758] -certified clinic 
coordinator or examining ophthalmologist.  The case report forms will be considered the source data.  
Data will be entered by [CONTACT_902711] a central database using the Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.55 REDCap is a secure, web- based application designed to 
support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for 
seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.  
 
Clinical examination data are recorded directly onto the CRFs during the clinic visit and are considered 
the source documentation.  Each item entered by [CONTACT_902712], legitimate ranges, legal dates, etc. and invalid ent ries are flagged.  Validation of data occurs during and 
after the data entry session.  Electronic logs of the completion status of each form and assessment are tracked by [CONTACT_902713].  Form revisions and additions are accommodated by [CONTACT_902714].   
 
Data that have been entered into REDCap are subject to additional consistency checking involvi ng more 
complex logic than implemented during data entry checking.  Often these post -entry checks involve 
several different forms and visits. The Center for Preventive Ophthalmology and Biostatistics ( CPOB)  
biostatitician  will develop the logic for these c hecks and the comments to be associated with the resulting 
data queries.  The Clinic Coordinator reviews edit messages and the corresponding data forms. If necessary, the Clinic Coordinator corrects the paper form, initials and dates the form, and updates the online database.  The updated data records are again subjected to the entire data checking system.  
When extraordinary circumstances arise in which the query may never be able to be resolved to meet the 
requirements of the edit logic, the biostatistici an may, with the approval of the Director, flag specific items 
on specific forms as exempt from further edit.  The REDCap system generates an entry into a log of 
changes  after every record correction so that a fully verifiable audit trail is created.   
 Records Retention  
REDCap databases are backed up on a regularly scheduled basis. The backup data files are kept in 
a secured environment and are available for recovery. Data files that reside on the CPOB file server 
are backed up nightly.  In addition, all C POB personnel are required to keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_902679], correspondence, and reports on the file server, which is on an automatic backup 
schedule.  Files of the data system as of the time of each data freeze and for each publication are al so 
archived.  
11 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
11.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
Phase 1:  After a subject has taken a study dose for [ADDRESS_1266116] will stop participation in the study at that point.  If after review of the adverse event(s) (and their quality) that a subject experienced at a particular dose, 
then the study physician also may stop the subject's participation in the study if there  is any safety 
concern.  If 4 or more (out of 15) subjects state that they could not imagine taking a particular dose for 18 
months, then that dose will not be used in the Phase 2 Trial.

Phase 2: Both the Sponsor and the Principal Investigators ensure safety and compliance.  T here will be a 
Data and Safety Monitor (DSM).  A D ata Safety Monitoring Plan has been developed based on risk.   At 
this time there is no Data Safety Monitoring Board as this is low risk study.  
 The Investigators will allocate adequate time for monitoring with regards to accurate and confidential 
record keepi [INVESTIGATOR_007], appropriate reporting of adverse events by [CONTACT_255564], The i nvestigator s will ensure that the 
monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -
related documents and study related facilities (e.g. ph armacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has 
adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.   
11.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the S ponsor, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The I nvestigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharm acy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
12 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US regulations , international standards of 
Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research pol icies and procedures.  
 The protocol and any amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_902715] [CONTACT_70887]/her  Institutional Review Board 
(IRB).  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the 
Investigator and a copy of each decision will be  provided to the S ponsor before changes are implement ed 
in the study.  
12.1 Risks  
Risks of Eye Examination Procedures and Tests  
There is a very rare risk of an allergic response to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_902680] (for eye pressure measurement) or dilate the pupil.  This occurs in less than 1% of eyes. Dilating drops rarely 
could cause an acute angle closure glaucoma attack (less than 1 in 1000).
[ADDRESS_1266117], autofluorescence,  or fundus photographs.  
 
Risks of study investigational medicines: Alpha Lipoic Acid  (ALA) and placebo  
ALA and placebo study drug risk is low.  ALA is available over -the-counter and is approved in [LOCATION_013] 
for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropath y.5-[ADDRESS_1266118] of these published studies on the safety and tolerability of ALA at doses 
of 1200 mg or higher involve adults that are not elderly.  
12.2 Benefits  
A key benefit is believed to be a reduction in GA enlargement in patients with AMD. Our central 
hypothesis, based on the existing literature and our own preliminary data, is that oral lipoic acid 
supplementation reduces the rate of enlargement of GA in AMD patients.  Subjects may not directly

medical care and monitoring.  Furthermore, i nformation from this study may help subjects and other s with 
geographic atrophy secondary to AMD receive better care in the fut ure. 
 Depending on funding availability, some subjects may be provided financial assistance with 
transportation costs at the discretion of the principal investigator.  
 Depending on funding availability, subjects may be provided a $[ADDRESS_1266119] at each of the follow -
up study visits  and a $[ADDRESS_1266120]  (Phase 1), it is not expected that subjects will receive any direct benefit.  However, 
information from the tolerability test will help to confirm the dose chosen for the Randomized, double- blind 
placebo controlled trial ( Phase 2).

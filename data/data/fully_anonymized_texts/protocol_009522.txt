Title: Clinical Study to Evaluate Cannabidiol Liver Enzyme Elevations and Drug Interactions  
Investigators:  Melanie Fein, MD     
Study Phase: 1 
Study Period:  This is a 2-part study. The duration of study participation will be up to 36 days 
(excluding the screening period) for Part 1. The duration of study particip ation will be up to 24 
days (excluding the screening period) for Part 2. 
Study Site: Spaulding Clinical Research Unit, West Bend, Wisconsin 
Background and Motivation:   
The cannabis plant contains bioactive compounds known as cannabinoids; delta-9 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most  prevalent cannabinoids in 
most varieties of cannabis.[ADDRESS_1092142] (Farm Bill) of [ADDRESS_1092143] to regulation under the Federal Food Drug  & Cosmetic Act, when  applicable (e.g., as 
drugs, foods, dietary supplement s, cosmetics, veterinary products) and the growing CBD 
products market raises various safety co ncerns, especially with long-term use.[ADDRESS_1092144] fo r the treatment of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrom e, or tuberous sclerosis complex.2 At labeled doses 
up to 25 mg/kg/day, an increased risk of liver enzyme elevation and drug-induced liver injury 
has been observed.2,3 However, only limited evaluations of the risk of liver enzyme elevation of 
daily, lower dose CBD use are available.3,4 The potential for liver enzyme elevations with CBD 
doses in unapproved consumer products highlights a need for further research to quantify risks 
at these doses. In addition, CBD has the capacity to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, lead ing to potential drug-dr ug interactions with 
multiple common medications.
2,[ADDRESS_1092145] suggested the potential for CBD to cause 
reproductive and endocrine effects.6-8 As such, additional high- quality clinical pharmacology 
studies are needed to further ch aracterize CBD's safety profile. 
This study will be divided into two parts.  
In Part 1, 200 healthy subjects will be randomized  to 5 mg/kg/day of CBD (150 subjects) or 
placebo (50 subjects) for 4 weeks with weekly laboratory assessments to characterize the

 percentage of participants with liver enzy me elevation (primary endpoint) or meeting 
withdrawal criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (secondary endpoint). Additional 
secondary endpoints include the change from base line to after 4 weeks of daily CBD dosing for 
male reproductive (testosterone and inhibin B) and thyroid hormones (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], triiodothryroni ne [T3] and thryroxine [T4]) as secondary endpoints. 
Exploratory endpoints include additional charact erization of liver findings and other blood 
biomarkers. 
In Part 2, 40 healthy subjects will receive either oral citalopram (20 subjects) or morphine (20 
subjects) at baseline and then again after receiving CBD 5 mg/kg/day to characterize the effect of daily cannabidiol use on the plasma concentr ation of citalopram a nd morphine. Citalopram 
was selected because it is a common prescription medication for depression and anxiety that is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19 and CYP3A4,
9 which CBD inhibits.5 Morphine was selected because 
it is a common opi[INVESTIGATOR_792151]2B7,10 which CBD inhibits.5 
Objectives:  
Part 1:  
To characterize the effects of daily cannabidiol use at a dose within the range of what 
consumers are taking as unapproved cannabidiol  products on liver enzyme elevations and 
endocrine measures.   
Part 2:  
To characterize the effects of daily cannabidiol use at a dose within the range of what 
consumers are taking as unapproved canna bidiol products on drug interactions.  
Endpoints:  
Part 1:  
x Primary Endpoint:  
x Percentage of participants with an ALT (based on consensus criteria*) or AST 
liver enzyme elevation greater than three times the upper limit of normal (>3 × 
ULN)

Study Design:  
This is a two-part study. Part 1 is a randomi zed, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel study 
in 200 subjects (150 subjects receiving 5 mg/ kg/day of CBD and 50 subjects receiving 
placebo). Part 2 is an open-labe l, sequential study in 40 subjects (two separate cohorts of 20 
subjects).

 In Part 1, subjects will report to the study site fo r screening from Days -28 to -2 and then will 
return to the site on Day -1 for check-in, ba seline assessments, and ra ndomization. Subjects will 
check out from the clinical site on Day 1 (1  night in-house stay) following dosing and study 
assessments. Subjects will recei ve CBD or placebo for [ADDRESS_1092147] ug interaction (DDI) cohort, subjec ts will report to the study site 
for screening from Days -28 to -2 and then will return to the site on Day -1 for check-in and baseline assessments. Subjects will check-out from the clinical site on Day 6 (6 nights in-house 
stay) following dosing and study assessments. Subj ects will return to the study clinic on Day [ADDRESS_1092148] one follow-up 
visit after the second check-out (Day 24). Subject s will receive CBD for 12 days (Day 6 to 17) 
and citalopram on Day 1 and Day 13. 
In the Part 2 morphine DDI cohort, subjects will report to the study site for screening from 
Days -28 to -2 and then will return to the site on Day -1 for check-in and baseline assessments. Subjects will check-out from the clinical s ite on Day 6 (6 nights in-house stay) following 
dosing and study assessments. Subjects will return  to the study clinic on Day 10 for a 3 night 
in-house stay with check-out on Day 13. Subjects will receive CBD for 9 days (Day 4 to 12) 
and morphine on Day 1, Day 4, and Day 11.  Subj ects will have one follow-up visit after the 
second check-out (Day 19).  
In both parts, the clinical site will contact [CONTACT_792159]. Subjects will unde rgo assessments as describe d in the Study Summary and 
Schedule of Events (Appendix A: Schedule of Events Part 1 and Appendix B: Schedule of 
Events Part 2).

divided doses twice daily (i .e. 2.5 mg/kg twice daily).  
x Oral placebo solution (matching characteris tics of cannabidiol solution). Placebo will be 
administered twice daily to approximately 50 participants in Part 1.  
x DDI substrate drugs: oral morphine (15 mg ) and oral citalopram (20 mg). Of the 
participants in Part 2, 20 will receive morphine and 20 will receive citalopram. 
For Part 1, subjects will be administered CBD on Day 1 and provided with adequate drug for 
at-home dosing on Days 2 through 6 at check-out . At the clinic visit on Day 7, subjects will 
receive dosing for the day as well as at-hom e dosing for Days 8 through 13. This will be 
repeated for clinic visits on Day 14 (primary study drug to cover dosing on Days 15 through 20) 
and Day 21 (primary study drug to cover dosing on Days 22 thr ough 27). Subjects will continue

unless deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_792161] a more detailed listing of inclusion/exclusi on criteria, refer to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of the 
protocol.  
Sample Collection  
Number of samples collected throughout the study can be found in the Schedule of Events (see 
Appendices A and B). Unscheduled pharmacokinetic and proteomics samples will be collected in subjects from Part 1 who discontinue due to liv er enzyme elevation as part of monitoring.   
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
The pharmacokinetic blood samples (6 mL each) will be collected into tubes containing 
K2EDTA, inverted several times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant, and placed in an ice 
bath. Within 30 minutes of collection, the sa mples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at 
3000 relative centrifugal force (RCF), at 4°C, by a study team member.  
The plasma will be separated using a disposable plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_792152] A liquot A (primary) and 
Aliquot B (backup). The plasma sa mples will be appropr iately labeled and stored frozen at –
70°C or below within 30 minutes after aliquoting until shipment. Temperature monitoring logs should be maintained and accessible for review by [CONTACT_11200].  
The Aliquot A samples (primary ) will be shipped first, on dr y ice, to the bioanalytical 
laboratory at FDA for processing when reque sted by [CONTACT_456]. The Aliquot B samples 
(backup) will be held for a second shipment after completion of a ll Aliquot A sample 
shipment(s) and the timing of the Aliquot B sh ipment will be communicated by [CONTACT_456]. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples w ill be collected by [CONTACT_792162] (IV) catheter on the following days. 
For Part 1, a single blood sample will be collected on days 1, 7, 14, 21, 29, and 35. Total 
number of PK blood samples will be  [ADDRESS_1092151] for Part 1.

 Additional Laboratory Assessments (Part 1):  
For Part 1, blood samples for assessment of ch anges from baseline in different endocrine, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and plasma proteins will be collected on Day 1 (morning, prior to dosing) and at check-
out on Day 29 (morning, time-matched to  the initial pre-dose assessment). 
Blood samples will be collected by [CONTACT_792163] (IV) 
catheter. Using red top tubes (no additives), ap proximately 8-10 mL of blood will be collected 
and processed for analysis. Additional details fo r sample collection and sample processing are 
in Section 4.7.2 to 4.7.4. 
Safety Assessments:  
Safety will be evaluated in terms of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory results 
(hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), v ital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temper ature), safety 12-lead ECG, and physical 
examination findings.  
Sample Size Determination:  
Approximately 190 healthy partic ipants planned for enrollment will be administered CBD. For 
Part 1, the primary endpoint is the percentage of CBD administe red participants with an ALT 
(based on consensus criteria*) or AST liver enzyme elevation greater than three times the ULN.  
Assuming the true event rate is 6%, the st udy has 95% probability of  observing [ADDRESS_1092154]. Assuming the true observed drug-induced liver injury (DILI)  event rate is 2%, the study has a 93% percent 
probability of observing 1 or more event. 
In Part 1, change from baseline comparisons will be performed for various  endocrine measures 
(e.g., total testoster one, inhibin B, TSH, total T3, and free T4). Sample size for the study is not 
powered for any of these comparisons nor are any adjustments planned for multiplicity.  
In Part 2, comparisons will be performed on ch anges in exposure for two different substrate 
drugs following administration with CBD. Assu ming no more than 20% discontinuations per 
arm, 30% intra-subject variability, and a two- sided test at the 0.[ADDRESS_1092155] 90% power to detect a 30% increase in exposure when the substrate 
drugs are co-administered with CBD.

 Statistical Methods: 
All data will be presented in data listings. Data from subjects excluded from an analysis 
population will be presented in th e data listings, but not included in the calculation of summary 
statistics. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_308299]. The number of subj ects who enroll in the study and the number and 
percentage of subjects who complete each assessment will be presented. The frequency and percentage of subjects who withdraw or discontinue from the study and the reason for 
withdrawal or discontinuation will be summarized. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic and baseline subject 
characteristics. For continuous variables, the mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 
and maximum values will be reported. For categorical (nominal) variables, the number and percentage of subjects (or observations) will be reported. 
Primary Analysis (Part 1): 
The primary endpoint is the percentage of subj ects with an ALT (based on consensus criteria) 
or AST liver enzyme elevation greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Results will be reported as percentage with a 95% confidence interval (CI).  
Secondary and Explorator y Analysis (Part 1): 
The secondary liver endpoint is the percentage of  participants with drug-induced liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_792164]). Analysis and reporting will be performed similar to the primary endpoint. Exploratory liver endpoints include the percen tage of participants with 
ALT or AST above different thres holds. Additional liver analysis details will be specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Endocrine endpoints will include the changes fro m baseline in serum to tal testoste rone and 
inhibin B in males after CBD administration compared to pl acebo. Change from baseline in 
thyroid stimulating hormone, total T3, and free T4 in both males and females after CBD administration compared to placebo will also be assessed.  
The percentage of subjects with either a bnormal testosterone (mal es only) or abnormal 
laboratory tests will also be reported. Results will be presented as point estimates with associated 95% CI.  
Additional details for secondary and exploratory analyses will be  specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Primary Analysis (Part 2): 
The primary analysis for Part 2 will be a comparison of the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC) and C max of citalopram or morphi ne when administered alone 
versus when co-administered with CBD (for morphine, this will include with the first dose of

 CBD and after 7 days of CBD dosing). Additional details will be specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Secondary and Explorator y Analysis (Part 2): 
For the secondary PK endpoints, AUC and C max for morphine metabolites (alone and when co-
administered with CBD) will be analyzed using the same approach as the primary PK endpoints. 
Additional exploratory PK parameters for citalopram, morphine, CBD, and metabolites, such as 
time of maximum concen tration, half-life, apparent clea rance, and apparent volume of 
distribution will be analyzed using noncompartme ntal methods based on actual sampling times. 
All parameters will be calculated using statistical software. Mean and individual concentration time profiles will be presented in graphs. 
Additional details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Safety (Part 1 and Part 2): 
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at l east 1 dose of the study drug. All 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of AEs, organized by [CONTACT_714399] s and preferred term, w ill be summarized with 
a focus on treatment-emergent AEs. Vital sign measurements will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_7206]. All values will be evaluated for clinically notable results. Data for additional safety pa rameters (e.g., physical examin ation findings) will be listed.

regulation under the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic  Act, when applicable (e.g., as drugs, foods, 
dietary supplements, cosmetics, veterinary products) and the growing CBD products market 
raises various safety concerns, especially with long-term use.1 
Cannabidiol (CBD) is extracted fr om Cannabis sativa L. plants. Pure  CBD typi[INVESTIGATOR_792153] 0.1% (w/w) tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBD  is available as a prescription drug product 
for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or 
tuberous sclerosis complex.2 At labeled doses up to 25 mg/kg/ day, an increased risk of liver 
enzyme elevation has been observed.2,3 However, only limited evaluations of the risk of liver 
enzyme elevation of daily, lower dose CBD use are available.3,4 The potential for liver enzyme 
elevations with CBD doses in  unapproved consumer products hi ghlights a need for further 
research to quantify risks at these doses. In a ddition, CBD has the capacity to inhibit cytochrome 
P450 enzymes and uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronos yltransferases, leading to potential drug-drug 
interactions with multiple common medications.2,5 The clinical significance of many of these 
interactions is also unclear. Fu rthermore, nonclinical studies ha ve suggested the potential for 
CBD to cause reproductive and endocrine effects.6-8 As such, additional high-quality clinical 
pharmacology studies are needed to furthe r characterize CBD's safety profile. 
This study will be divided into two parts.  
In Part 1, 200 healthy subjects will be randomized  to 5 mg/kg/day of CBD (150 subjects) or 
placebo (50 subjects) for 4 weeks with weekly laboratory assessments to characterize the percentage of participants with  liver enzyme elevation (primary  endpoint) or meeting withdrawal 
criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury  (secondary endpoint). Additional secondary 
endpoints include the change from baseline to after 4 weeks of daily CBD dosing for male 
reproductive (testosterone and inhibin B) and thyroid hormones (thyroi d stimulating hormone 
[TSH], triiodothryronine [T3] and thryroxine  [T4]) as secondary endpoints. Exploratory 
endpoints include additional characterization of  liver findings and other blood biomarkers. 
In Part 2, 40 healthy subjects will receive either oral citalopram (20 subjects) or morphine (20 
subjects) at baseline and then again after receiving CBD 5 mg/kg/day to characterize the effect of daily cannabidiol use on the plas ma concentration of citalopram  and morphine. Citalopram was 
selected because it is a common prescription me dication for depression and anxiety that is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19 and CYP3A4,
9 which CBD inhibits.5 Morphine was selected because 
it is a common opi[INVESTIGATOR_792151]2B7,10 which CBD inhibits.5

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Study Design 
Part 1 
Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled, parallel study in 200 subjects over a 
single treatment period of 28 days. Oral solution CBD at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg twice a day, for a 
total of 5 mg/kg CBD daily, w ill be administered to the trea tment group of [ADDRESS_1092159] of 50 subjects.  Subjects will report to the study site for 
screening from Days -28 to -2 and then will return to the site on Day -1 for check-in and baseline assessments. Subjects will check- out from the clinical site on Day 1 (1-night in-house stay) 
following dosing and study assessments. Subjects will receive take-home doses of CBD or 
placebo for [ADDRESS_1092160] one follow-up visit on 
Day 35. Chemistry and hematol ogy assessments will be performed on days -1, 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 
29, and 35. Endocrine assessments will be performed on days 1 and 29.  
The study design is as follows:

During the screening visit (Days -28 to -2 for both Part 1 and Part 2), the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject is appropriate for the study. The informed consent 
form will be reviewed with the subject by a me mber of the study team and the subject will be 
encouraged to ask questions to ensure he or she has a good understanding of the study. If the 
subject is eligible and agrees to participate, the subject will be asked to sign the informed consent form before any study-specific procedur e is performed, including randomization. 
After the consent process is complete, demographic data, medical history, and concomitant 
medications will be recorded. A physical ex amination will be performed by a study team 
member. Clinical laboratory tests (hematol ogy, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) will be 
performed. Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test result. Screening tests will be performed within 28 days of and no later than 1 day before Day –1 for both parts. Subjects will undergo assessments as describe d above and in the Study Summa ry and Schedule of Events 
(Appendix A & B).
Subjects will be discharged from the study after completion of all study procedures. If a subject 
discontinues from the study premat urely, all procedures scheduled  for the end of the study will 
be performed. Meal timing and co mponents, activity levels, and general conditions in the study 
clinic will be as similar as possible on the treatment days. Subjects previously screened, but not initially enrolled in a cohort w ill be allowed to rescreen.
4.1.1. Risk/BenefitSubjects will be informed that participation in a human clinical pharmacology study like the 
present one cannot be of benef it to healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, the information from the 
physical examination, vital sign measurements, and laboratory test results may be shared with 
the subject’s personal physician if this is the subj ect’s choice. Subjects will be informed that it is 
also their choice to inform their personal physician that they are participating in this research 
study.

Subjects will be informed that they may be expos ed to risks associated with the pharmacological 
properties of the study drug and the study proced ures. The following summary of potential AEs 
for the study drugs will be provided to and discussed with the subjects.  
1. Oral cannabidiol 5 mg/kg/day: The most common adverse events include somnolence, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, ALT/AST elevation, fatigue, malaise, asthenia, rash, insomnia/sleep disorder, and infection.
2  
2. Oral citalopram 20 mg: The most common adverse events include fever, arthralgia, myalgia, 
anorexia, agitation, somnolence , insomnia, sinusitis, ejaculation disorder (primarily 
ejaculatory delay), decreased libido, and impotence.11  
3. Oral morphine 15 mg: The most common adve rse events include constipation, nausea, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], lightheadedness, dizzine ss, drowsiness, vomiting, and sweating.12  
Selected doses of individu al drugs are within the FDA approved labeled doses. 
x Cannabidiol – Cannabidiol (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) will be administered orally 2.5 mg/kg BID for a 
total of 5 mg/kg/day for 28 days in Part 1 and for 9 days (morphine cohort) or 12 days 
(citalopram cohort) in Part 2. Labeled dosing initiates treatment at 5 mg/kg/day. Dosing is capped at 25 mg/kg/day for maximum mainte nance dosage. DDI interactions can occur 
with drugs that are strong inducers/inhibitors  of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 and substrates of 
UGT1A9, UGT2B7, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2 C19. Studies with cannabidiol have 
initiated dosing at up to 25 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks
13, which is higher dosing and for a 
longer duration than proposed for this study. 
x Citalopram – Citalopram (Cel exa) will be administered once at 20 mg on days 1 and 13. 
Citalopram’s initial dosage is 20 mg once daily  with or without food and may increase to 
a maximum of 40 mg once daily.11 DDI interaction included CYP2C19 inhibitor. The 
maximum recommended dose of citalopram is 20 mg/day for patients who are taking 
concomitant CYP2C19 inhibitor since it may lead  to increased blood levels of citalopram 
and risk of QT prolongation or Torsade de Pointes.14

 4.6 Study Visits 
4.6.1 Recruitment 
Recruitment materials (e.g., internet, radio, and pr int advertisements, social media posts) will be 
approved by [CONTACT_458108]. The sponsor is  responsible for registration 
of the study on clinicaltrials.gov. R ecruitment may not occur until the study is fully registered on 
clinicaltrials.gov. 
4.6.2 Compensation 
Subjects will be offered payment for Screening; ho wever, if the results of their alcohol and drug 
screening tests are positive, they will not be compensated. Subjects who complete the entire study will receive payment according to the schedule  provided in the informed consent form. No 
special incentives are offered. Final payment will not be released until all follow-up procedures have been completed and acc epted by [CONTACT_093]. 
If a subject chooses to withdraw from the study pr ematurely, he or she will only be compensated 
for completed days. If subjects are withdrawn for medical reasons or if the study is halted 
temporarily or permanently, the subjects will receive compensation pr oportional to the time 
spent in the study. No compensation will be provide d if a subject is dismissed from the study for 
noncompliance (e.g., improper conduct, ingesting al cohol and/or drugs [i ncluding recreational 
drugs], tampering with the study drug, consu ming any prohibited f oods or beverages). 
If subjects are required to stay in the clinic for a longer period for safety reasons, they will be 
compensated at a rate proporti onal to the entire compensation fo r the study. If a subject becomes 
ill or physically injured because of participation in this study, the subject will be referred for 
treatment. 
4.6.3 Screening  The following procedures and assessments will be performed at Screening for both parts (Days -
28 to –2): 
x Obtain informed consent/HIPAA authoriza tion. The informed consent process will be 
performed by a clinical research nurse in a private room. The subject will be given unlimited time to ask questions regardi ng study participation, and each subject will be questioned to 
ensure their understanding.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Specimen Handling 
The PK blood samples (6mL each) will be  collected into tubes containing K 2EDTA, inverted 
several times to mix the blood with  the anticoagulant, and placed in an ice bath. Within 30 
minutes of collection, the sample s will be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at 3000 RCF, at 4°C, by a 
study team member. 
The plasma will be separated using a disposable  plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_791376] e qually aliquoted into 
duplicate cryotube vials labeled as Aliquot A (primary) and Aliquot B (backup). The plasma 
samples will be appropriately labeled and stored frozen at -70°C or below within 30 minutes after aliquoting until shipment. Temperature monitoring logs should be maintained and 
accessible for review by [CONTACT_11200].  
The Aliquot A samples (primary) w ill be shipped first, on dry ice, to the bioanalytical laboratory 
at FDA for processing when requested by [CONTACT_181880]. The Aliquot B sa mples (backup) will be 
held for a second shipment after completion of all Aliquot A sample sh ipment(s) and the timing 
of the Aliquot B shipment will be communicated  by [CONTACT_456]. None of the PK blood samples 
will be stored at the clinical facility for future use.

4.7.3 Safety Assessments 
Safety will be evaluated in terms of AEs, clinical labor atory results (hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign measurements  (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and oral body temperature), safety 12 lead EC G results, and physical examination findings.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1092192] and/or unintended sign, including an abnormal clinical 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with the use of a study drug, 
whether or not considered rela ted to the study drug. Events or conditions that increase in 
frequency or severity during or as a consequence of use of a drug in human clinical trials will also be considered AEs. 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins after study drug 
administration. 
An unexpected AE is any AE having a specificity or severity not consis tent with the current 
investigator’s brochure for the study drug(s). 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that meets the 
following criteria: 
x Results in death, 
x Is life threatening, 
x Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588], 
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 
x Results in a congenital anomaly/ birth defect due to exposure prior to conception or during 
pregnancy, or 
x Is an important medical event that may not  meet the previous criteria but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, jeopardizes the subject or re quires medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously.

continue until discharge (or early  termination). All AEs, whet her serious or nonserious and 
whether or not related to the study drug, must be  recorded in the eCRF. Study subjects will be 
instructed to warn study staff if he or she has any unexpected symptoms. In addition, all subjects 
will receive a reminder telephone call approximately 24 h before check-in. 
Any SAE (whether expected or unexpected) must be entered into the e CRF system and reported 
by [CONTACT_792170] [ADDRESS_1092194] be reported promptly to the investigator’s IRB as per the IRB’s 
requirements. 
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SA E, the sponsor will notif y the appropriate FDA 
authorities within [ADDRESS_1092195] possibly related to 
the study drug will be submitted in writing to th e FDA within 10 working days of receipt. 
Furthermore, any AEs that are not expected, occur at a higher frequency, or would require

10 working days. 
Adverse events that are assessed by [CONTACT_792171]. All SAEs will be followed until resolution. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Assessment of Severity 
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE using the following scale: 
x Mild: The subject is aware of the AE but is still able to perform all activities; minimal or no 
medical intervention or therapy is required. 
x Moderate: The subject has to discontinue some activities due to the AE; minimal or no 
medical intervention or therapy is required. 
x Severe: The subject is incapacitated by [CONTACT_792172]; 
significant medical intervention or therapy is  required, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594].

U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
 Protocol Number: SCR-016 
(Version 3.0) 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 38 of 72 
  
 The investigator will assess th e causal relationship/ relatedness of each AE to the study drug 
using the following scale: 
x Not Related: Onset of the AE has no reasonable temporal rela tionship to administration of 
the study drug, a causal relationship to adminis tration of the study drug is biologically 
implausible, or the event is attri buted to an alternative etiology. 
x Unlikely Related: Onset of the AE has a re asonable temporal relationship to study drug 
administration and although a causa l relationship is unlikely, it is biologically plausible. 
x Possibly Related: Onset of the AE has a strong temporal relati onship to administration of the 
study drug, cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clin ical state or other f actors, and a causal 
relationship is biologically plausible. 
x Probably Related: On set of the AE shows a distinct tempor al relationship to administration of 
the study drug that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state or other factors, the AE 
is a known reaction to the product or chemical  group or can be predicted by [CONTACT_77425]’s 
pharmacology. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1092196] will be performed for female subjects at the time points presented in the Schedule of Events (Appendix A and B). If a s ubject becomes pregnant while on the study, this 
should be reported immediately to the investigator , the subject will be withdrawn from the study 
and the medical monitor and the subject will be instructed to follow up with his or her personal physician. All pregnancie s are to be reported as an AE and followed for outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests Clinical laboratory and diagnostic screening tests will be performed  at the time points presented 
in the Schedule of Events and will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. Clinical laboratory testing will be pe rformed by [CONTACT_792173](s). The

 In addition, the severity of  all instances of DILI are to be a ssessed according to the International 
DILI Expert Working Group’s severity index15 (Appendix D). This severity assessment will 
occur in addition to the AE reporting procedures  detailed in [IP_ADDRESS].2 (Adverse  Event Reporting).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Sign Measurements Vital signs (blood pressure, hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body te mperature) will be 
measured using an automated device at the time points presented in the Schedule of Events ( and B). Vital signs may be repeated  at investigator discretion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety 12-lead Electrocardiograms 
12-lead ECGs will be obtained with the subjects in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_792155]. ECGs 
will be overread by a physician. If an abnormality is observed, the subject will be instructed to 
follow up with his or her personal physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will be performed  at the time points presented in the Schedule 
of Events (Appendix A and B). 
The complete physical examinati on will include, but not be limited to, assessments of the head, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, nervous sy stem, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], cardiovascular system, 
abdomen (liver and spleen), ly mph nodes, and extremities. Hei ght, weight (without shoes and 
wearing the lightest possible cl othing), and calculation of body ma ss index will be performed at 
Screening and check-out. 
If a clinically significant abnormality is observe d upon physical examination, the subject will be 
instructed to follow up with his or her personal physician. 
4.7.4 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographic data (date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity) will be collected at Screening. 
Each subject will provide a complete medical history at Screening that will be reviewed at 
check-in. Specific information relating to any prior or existing medical conditions/surgical 
procedures will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
4.8 Study Treatments 
4.8.1 Dose Selection and Rational  
Cannabidiol (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) oral solution will be obt ained for 190 participants (150 in Part 1 and 40 
in Part 2) to receive cannabidiol twice daily as per the Schedule of Ev ents. All dosing will be 
oral. Anticipated dosing is 5 mg/kg/day administe red in divided doses twice daily (i.e. 2.5 mg/kg 
twice daily). Oral placebo solution (matching characteristics of cannabidiol solution) will be obtained for 50 participants in Part 1 to receive placebo twice daily as per the schedule of events. 
U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
 Protocol Number: SCR-016 
(Version 3.0) 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 of 72 
  
 Cannabidiol’s label indicates a maximum dosag e of 20 mg/kg/day, therefore the proposed study 
dose of 5 mg/kg/day is lower than the maximum therapeutic dose noted in the label. Data from a recent meta-analysis marked 400 mg/day as an upper limit of what can be considered low dose CBD and attainable using ove r the counter CBD products.
16 In this study, total daily dosing will 
be in line with this threshold (200 mg twice daily for an 80 kg person). The anticipated DDI 
substrate drugs are oral morphine and oral citalopram. Of the participants in Part 2, [ADDRESS_1092201] udy drugs (Part 2) will be administered with 
[ADDRESS_1092202] to m onitor study drug tolerance and patient outcomes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Method of Assigning Subjec ts to Treatment Sequence 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1092203] biostatistician (or designee) will generate a dummy 
randomization schedule. The sche dule is generated in R.  
The project biostatistician (or designee) dist ributes the ‘dummy’ randomization schedule to 
specified personnel and pharmacy for review. Any change (e.g., change in block size, change in 
stratification levels) that requires an update to the specifications will reset this process. Minor changes (e.g., display formatting) will not require a change to the specifications. 
U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
 Protocol Number: SCR-016 
(Version 3.0) 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 of 72 
  
 After the approval of the ‘dummy’ randomizati on schedule, the project biostatistician (or 
designee) transfers the program used to gene rate the ‘dummy’ schedule to the randomization 
biostatistician (unblinded), who is an independent party and will not be participating in any programming or statistical decisi ons for the study before breaking the blind. No transfer is 
necessary if the unblinded randomization bi ostatistician also created the ‘dummy’ 
randomization. 
The randomization biostatistician is  responsible for generating the final randomization schedule. 
The output is sent only to designated unblinded recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], who will maintain a secured digital and printed copy for their use. 
Archival of the programs and output is accomplished by [CONTACT_792174], password-
protected ZIP file containing the program and output file(s). The ZIP file is copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a secure 
storage drive on the sponsor’s site. 
Randomization will occur after informed consent is obtained in Part 1, either after completion of 
check-in procedures on Day -[ADDRESS_1092204] before  dosing on Day 1. Approxima tely 200 healthy male 
and female subjects are planned for enrollment  in Part 1 ([ADDRESS_1092205] receiving CBD and 50 
receiving placebo). 
All randomization information will be secured and housed in a lo cked storage area, accessible 
only by [CONTACT_792175].

U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
 Protocol Number: SCR-016 
(Version 3.0) 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 72 
  
 4.9.1 Sample Size 
A total of 240 healthy subjects are planned for en rollment and approximately  190 of these will be 
administered CBD. The primary endpoint is the pe rcentage of CBD admin istered participants 
with an ALT (based on consensus criteria*) or AST liver enzyme elevation greater than three 
times the ULN.  Assuming the true event rate is 6%, the study has 95% probability of observing 
[ADDRESS_1092219]. Assuming the true observed drug-induced liver in jury event rate is 2%, the study has a 93% 
percent probability of observing 1 or more event. 
In Part 1, change from baseline comparisons will be performed for various  endocrine laboratory 
measures (e.g., total testosterone , inhibin B, TSH, total T3, and free T4). Sample size for the 
study is not powered for any of these compar isons nor are any adjustments planned for 
multiplicity.  
In Part 2, comparisons will be performed on ch anges in exposure for two different substrate 
drugs following administration with CBD. Assu ming no more than 20% discontinuations per 
arm, 30% intra-subject variability, and a two-side d test at the 0.[ADDRESS_1092220] 90% power to detect a 30% diff erence in exposure when the substrate drugs are 
co-administered with CBD.  
4.9.[ADDRESS_1092221] liver lab data (ALT and AST) for the tr eatment period collected before 
dosing and at [ADDRESS_1092222] laboratory/proteomics 
measures (e.g., free and total test osterone, inhibin B, TSH, to tal T3, free T4, lipid panel, 
proteomics) from pre-dose on Day 1 and check-out on Day 29 (time-matched to Day 1). The laboratory population will be used for all analyses involving change from baseline in 
laboratory/proteomics measures.  
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1092223] 1 dose of the study drug.

and maximum values will be reported. For categorical (nominal) variables, the number and percentage of subjects (or observations) will be reported. 
4.9.[ADDRESS_1092225] s with an ALT (based on consensus criteria) or 
AST liver enzyme elevation greater than thr ee times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Results 
will be reported as percen tage with a 95% confidence interval .  The secondary liver endpoint is 
the percentage of participants meeting withdrawal criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury. Analysis and reporting will be perform ed similar to the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints involving labor atory measures will include the changes from baseline in 
serum total testosterone  and inhibin B in males after CBD administration compared to placebo. 
Change from baseline in thyroid stimulating hormone, total T3, and free T4 in both males and females after CBD administration compared to placebo will also be assessed. These analyses will use a mixed-effect analysis approach. The model will include treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Testing will be two-sided, and a significant increase will be 
concluded if the two-sided 95% CI  excludes 0. In addition, the percen tage of subjects with either 
abnormal total testos terone (males only) or abnormal la boratory tests will also be reported. 
Results will be presented as point estimates with associated 95% CI. 
Part 2 
The primary analysis for Part 2 will be a comp arison of the area under the plasma concentration-
time curve (AUC) and C max of citalopram or morphine when administered alone versus when co-
administered with CBD (for morphine, this will in clude after co-administration with CBD for 1-
day and 7-days). The PK parameters (AUC and C max) will be analyzed using noncompartmental 
methods based on actual sampling times. Using li near mixed-effects modeling, comparisons of 
U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

estimated for the PK parameters. Geometric mean ratio and 90% CI will be obtained by [CONTACT_792180] 90% CI based on the log-transformed scale.  
For the secondary PK endpoints, AUC and C
max for morphine metabolites (alone and when co-
administered with CBD) will be an alyzed using the same approach as the primary PK endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Analyses 
Part 1 
Assessment of liver-related adverse events will be performed consistent with FDA’s Guidance 
for Industry on Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premar keting Clinical Evaluation. This will include 
but is not limited to the following categorical and visual summaries: 
x 3x-, 5x-, 10x-, and 20x ULN elevations of AST, ALT, and either ALT or AST. 
x Any elevations of bilirubin; elevated TBL to >2x ULN. 
x Any elevations of ALP >1.5xULN. 
x Elevation of ALT or AST (>3x ULN) accompanied by [CONTACT_181243] (>1.5x ULN, 
>2x ULN). 
x Elevation of ALT or AST in temporal a ssociation with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
abdominal pain, or fatigue. 
Portions of collected blood samples from this  study will be used for evaluating laboratory 
measures and differentially expr essed plasma proteins. Additiona l details regarding the methods 
for the exploratory analyses will be described in a separate protocol. Steady state CBD and metabolite drug concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_16750]. 
Part 2 
Additional exploratory PK parameters for citalopram, morphine, CBD, and metabolites, such as 
time of maximum concen tration, half-life, apparent clea rance, and apparent volume of 
distribution will be analyzed using noncompartme ntal methods based on actual sampling times. 
All parameters will be calculated using statistical software. Mean and individual concentration time profiles will be presented in graphs.

 Appendix D – Drug-Induced Liver Injury Assessment 
The threshold criteria for definition of a case DILI as well as the severity grading score 
are listed below15. 
Definitions for DILI include one of the following thresholds: 
i)  5 × ULN elevation in ALT (ULN for ALT is 33 U/L for males and 25 
U/L for females) OR 
ii)  2 × ULN elevation in ALP (with accompanying elevations of 
GGT in the absence of known bone pathology driving the rise in ALP level) OR 
iii)  3 × ULN elevation in ALT and simultaneous elevation of bilirubin 
concentration exceeding 2 × ULN 
Severity grading of DILI based on the In ternational DILI Expert Working Group’s 
severity index (4-point scale): 
1. Mild: ALT  5 × ULN or ALP  2 × ULN and TBL < 2 × ULN 
2. Moderate: ALT  5 × ULN or ALP  2 × ULN and TBL  2 × ULN, or 
symptomatic hepatitis 
3. Severe: ALT  5 × ULN or ALP  2 × ULN and TBL  2 × ULN, and 
symptomatic hepatitis and 1 of the following criteria: 
- ,15  
- Ascites and/or encepha lopathy, disease duration < 26 weeks, and 
absence of underlying cirrhosis 
- Other organ failure due to DILI 
4. Fatal/transplantation: Death or liver transplantation due to DILI

PROJECT OVERVIEW  
 
Purpose  
The purpose of this work is to examine the efficacy of a brief intervention to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_323505].  
We will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test our newly adapted Opi[INVESTIGATOR_323506] (vs. 
Treatment As Usual; TAU) for a population of patients presenting for Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery 
(N=100). Our intervention will include a discussion of the risks of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pain management through 
nonnarcotic medication and mindfulness techniques, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_323507] [ADDRESS_399363] patients 
with reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], even for those with chronic pain. We will assess outcomes using opi[INVESTIGATOR_323508], prescription drug monitoring, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_323509] 4 weeks (short term follow up) 
and 12 weeks (long term follow up) following TKR surgery.  
 
Aim 1 : Examine the efficacy of our ORP vs. TAU control in reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_323510]. 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_323511], pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], medical chart  review of 
prescription refills, and prescription drug monitoring for opi[INVESTIGATOR_323512].  
Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize that at 4 weeks, a higher percentage of those in the OPR group will express an 
intent to reduce future opi[INVESTIGATOR_323513].  
Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize that those in the ORP will have lower cumulative exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_323514] (i.e., morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs] at 12 weeks) than those in TAU.  
 
Aim 2 : Examine the relation between opi[INVESTIGATOR_323515].  
Hypothesis 3 : We predict that those who reduce their opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (as evidenced by [CONTACT_323545]) will engage 
more in activities that will increase range of motion and functional knee use (e.g.,physical therapy and at -
home exercises), thereby [CONTACT_323546].  
  
[ADDRESS_399364] year, demonstrating that opi[INVESTIGATOR_323516] a critical 
public health problem.2,3 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_323517].4 
Evidence suggests that greater exposure (in terms of medication strength and length of use) is linearly  
related to risk of later misuse.5,6 Recent medical claims research indicates that among opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve  
patients (N=536,767), those who fill opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] 1 time are 2.9% more likely to become long  
term users (vs. non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]), whereas those who fill 4 or more times are 26.1% more likely to use  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_323518].5,[ADDRESS_399365] more opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595].7-10 
 
When considering the risk of exposure, orthopedic surgery settings are a clear point of intervention.  
Orthopedic surgeries are associated with the prescribing of more opi[INVESTIGATOR_323519],11 
particularly for total knee replacement surgery (TKR),[ADDRESS_399366] for extended periods in some patients; Significant  
pain (visual analog scale score of > 40) is reported by 44.4% of patients at [ADDRESS_399367] -surgery, 22.6%  
of patients at [ADDRESS_399368] -surgery, 18.4% of  patients at [ADDRESS_399369] -surgery, and 13.1% of patients  
at [ADDRESS_399370] - surgery.14 Management of this pain can lead to lengthy opi[INVESTIGATOR_5437]; Namba et  
al. found that of 24,105 TKR patients, 9,914 (41.5%) continued opi[INVESTIGATOR_323520] [ADDRESS_399371] is a randomized clinical trial to explore the efficacy of  
our Total Knee Replacement Opi[INVESTIGATOR_323521] (ORP) vs. Treatment As Usual (TAU) in the  
reduction of opi[INVESTIGATOR_323522].  
Intervention Content:  
1. Psychoeducation 
2. Non narcotic pain management  
3. Mindfulness 
 
Population 
We will recruit a large sample of patients (N=1 00) who present for TKR surgery at Campbell Clinic. 
Participants must be [ADDRESS_399372] meet the following requirements: 
• Presenting for  a pre- operatory appointment at Campbell Clinic for TKR surgery that will result in the 
prescribing of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]   
• 18 years of age or older 
• Have access to a telephone  
• Be able to understand consent procedures  
Exclusion Criteria   
Those that exhibit any of the following will be ineligible to participate:  
• Contraindication to opi[INVESTIGATOR_323523] a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: 
TKR ORP intervention or treatment- as-usual (TAU).  
Randomization will occur on a 1:1 ratio in blocks of 4.  
 
Outcome Measures  
Outcomes Aim 1: We will assess regular opi[INVESTIGATOR_323524], using a daily diary of opi[INVESTIGATOR_289349], opi[INVESTIGATOR_323525], information transcribed from the medical file (medication 
prescribed and prescription refill requests), and prescription drug monitoring data.  
Outcomes Aim 2: We will assess functional recovery using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score.24 In addition to our main outcomes, we will assess potential confounders and moderat ors of 
treatment, including history of and current chronic pain,25 pain catastrophizing,26 opi[INVESTIGATOR_323526],27,28 adverse events, knowledge about opi[INVESTIGATOR_323527]/following intervention, and transcribed 
surgical specifics from the medical file (analgesia, complications).  
 
  
[ADDRESS_399373] s. William “Bill ” Mihalko, Marc  Mihalko, Ford, Guyton, Crockarell, and Harkess (or their 
assistants) or study staff from the surgery schedule, which requires access to Campbell Clinic’s electronic 
health record (ehr SRS). Remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria will be determined from a screening measure conducted prior to enrollment and randomization.  
 
Recruitment Script  
Introduction: Hi, My name [CONTACT_832] [Name] from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. We are 
partnered with the Campbell Clinic to recruit patients into the TKR Study, a project where we talk to people 
about their medication following total knee replacement surgery. Your surgeon, [Surgeon’s Name], is one of 
our partners, so I wanted to introduce myself to you and see if you’d be interested in learning more about a 
study for Total Knee Replacement patients.  
If they don’t seem interested : No worries, thank you for your time. If you change your mind, feel free to 
reach out to your doctor or [Doctor’s Assistant’s Name] anytime before your surgery. They can give you my information.  
If they seem inte rested : Great! The TKR Study’s goal is to test a behavioral treatment program in Total Knee 
Replacement surgery patients. The purpose is to educate patients on appropriate use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_323528]. If you wanted to participate, you would need to complete 3 or 4 visits with us, depending on 
which group you are placed in. If you are in the control group (treatment as usual), you will just have [ADDRESS_399374] an extra visit 2 weeks after your surgery. It 
shouldn’t last longer than [ADDRESS_399375] visit, 4 week visit, 
and 12 week visit, you will receive a total of $150 for your time.  
Does this sound like something you’d like to do? (If yes: screen for eligibility and begin baseline visit 
procedures or schedule a baseline visit).

 Baseline Visit                                                             
Prior to surgery , interested patients will be assessed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those who are eligible 
will be consented prior to participation. After consent, we will collect baseline measures, and participants will 
be randomized. Those randomized to the intervent ion arm will receive the intervention during this visit.  
Please see the measures section to review which measures are used during the Baseline visit.  
 
Screening 
Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_323548] -report. Potential participants will be informed 
about the general overview of the study. If the patient expresses interest in the study, the Eligibility 
Questionnaire will then be administered to determine eligibility. (This can also be done at the beginning of a 
scheduled Baseline Visit before consent).  
 
Informed Consent 
The consent of the subject will be obtained at the first study visit at the participant's physician visit. If in-
person is not possible, informed consent can also be done over -the- phone using either Docusign (digital 
signature) or by [CONTACT_323549]. Please note if mailing: the participant’s surgery date should be more than [ADDRESS_399376], and the original(s) will be placed in the subjects' research record. An 
entry documenting informed consent must also be made in the subjects' research record to confirm that 
informed consent was obtained prior to any study -related procedures and that the subject received a signed 
copy. The objection of any subject in word or action to the performance of study procedures will be sufficient 
for their withdrawal or exclusion from the study.  
Illiterate English Speaking Subjects  Procedures (from the IRB): 
1. Potent ial subjects who are mentally competent and understand English, but who do not read or 
write English (i.e., are illiterate), may be enrolled in research studies by [CONTACT_323550] “X” on 
the consent document in the space for the participant signature [CONTACT_323557].  
2. Upon verbal explanation, the potential subject should be able to: a. describe the study procedures in 
lay terms and appreciate what will be involved in participation in the study, b. understand the risk(s) 
and benefit(s) of being in the study, and c. indicate approval or disapproval regarding participation in the study.  
[ADDRESS_399377] 
the method(s) utilized to communicate with the subject and the method(s) utilized by [CONTACT_323551].  
4. A signed copy of the informed consent document shall be given to the subject or his or her legally authorized representative.  
5. Video and audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_323537]’s policies.  
Study procedures will not continue until a signed consent form is received.  Please note: if the consent is done 
by [CONTACT_2319], we cannot do any study procedures or collect information until we receive the signed consent form back in the mail.  
If a participant decides NOT to consent, the process will immediately be stopped, and the consent form will 
be voided. The participant will be given an ID number in the database, classified as “Did Not Consent”, and no 
information will be stored except for their MRN number.   
 
Profile Information & Assessments  
After informed consent  is complete, the next step is to collect profile information within the databas e. This 
includes information such as: 
• Participant’s first/last name  
• Phone number 
• Mailing address  
• Email  
• Best method of contact  
• Alternate Contact  
• Surgery date  
• Etc. 
After filling out all the necessary profile information, select “create visit checklist” in the database, and it 
should take you to the questionnaires for Visit 1 (Baseline). The assessments should now be administered, 
starting with demographics and ending with the knowledge pre -test. Once each measure is complete, you 
will notice the box in the database turns a different color to reflect that. With that being said, do  not click on 
questionnaires in future visits, as this will mess up the database , and there is no way to reverse it.  
 
Randomization 
Randomization happens during the Baseline Visit, after all the assessments are complete. Please note that 
randomization and treatment (ORP) must occur during the same visit . The randomization scheme is as 
follows:  
CTSI -TKR is a prospective randomized clinical trial with two treatment arms (n = 50 each for a total of 100 
participants): Opi[INVESTIGATOR_323521] (ORP) and Treatment As Usual (TAU) . Participants are individually 
12 
 assigned to a study arm by [CONTACT_323552] -block randomization  (randomly chosen block -lengths of 4 or 6 
and separate sequences in each of the two strata defined by [CONTACT_4321]/gender). 
The randomization scheme was determined by [CONTACT_323553] 
“Study Management” folder. Within the randomization log, simply locate the appropriate tab (according to your participant’s gender) and find the next blank, which will tell you if that person is 
in ORP group (intervention) or TAU group (control). Make sure to fill out the study ID number, date 
of BV, and transfer the allocID to the participant’s database profile.  
 
Intervention 
Intervention will be delivered only to the  ORP group , at the baseline visit and at a [ADDRESS_399378] will provide information regarding: 
• Harms associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (e.g., overdose and accidents) 
• Tolerance & addiction risk factor s 
• Pain expectation following TKR surgery  
• Non -narcotic pain management techniques  
• Proper disposal of unused medication  
Please refer to the intervention manual for more details on the intervention, such as: 
(a) Theoretical basis and overarching goals of the intervention  
(b) Treatment Schedule  
(c) Intervention Scripts  
(d) Patient Handouts  
(e) Interventionist Training  
(f) Intervention Fidelity  
The intervention manual is located on onedrive in the CTSI TKR Opi[INVESTIGATOR_323538]. The manual is specifically 
within the intervention folder.  
 
Follow- Ups & Data Abstraction  
Following the baseline visit and surgery , we will engage with patients when they return to the Campbell Clinic 
for their Physical Therapy (PT) visits  or over the phone  to complete follow- up assessments. All participants 
will complete follow- up assessments with  a Research Assistant (RA) blinded to treatment condition. Follow 
up assessments will occur at [ADDRESS_399379] of doing the measures for that visit and  a data abstraction after the visit is complete.  
Please see the measures section to review which measures are used during the follow -up visits.  
13 
 4-week abstraction: This is a surgical note abstraction, meaning that we are looking for notes from the 
patient’s physician within the Campbell Clinic health record system (SRS).  
12-week abstraction : This will be a prescription based  abstraction. Using the Campbell Clinic system and TN -
CSMD will be required.   
 
Campbell Clinic SRS  
The Campbell Clinic SRS is available to staff members who have been credentialed at Campbell Clinic. This 
process is overseen by [CONTACT_323554] (Campbell Clinic Research Nurse 
Coordinator). In order to access the SRS system, staff  must VPN into the Campbell Clinic server using this link: 
https://citrixnew.campbellclinic.com/vpn/index.html  (username/password are the Campbell Clinic 
credentials). Once logged in, staff needs to select the orange “SRS” icon the right end of the screen. This will start a download process. Double click the download, and it will load the health record system. You will need 
to sign in again with Campbell Clinic credentials.  
If for some rea son it doesn’t work, you will need to make sure you have Citrix Receiver downloaded and/or 
call Campbell Clinic’s IT line: 901 -435-5678 . 
 
TN-CSMD  
The TN -CSMD (Tennessee Controlled Substance Monitoring Database) is a database to monitor the 
dispensing of Schedule II, III, IV, & V controlled substances. We use this database during the 30 -day data 
abstraction to see if the participant has been prescribed any opi[INVESTIGATOR_323539].  
Registration:  
Accessing the TN-C SMD first requires a physician sponsor. We have used [CONTACT_323559] of Campbell 
Clinic in the past.  
 
 
Using the CSMD:

COVID-19 Procedures  
Baseline 
To safely adhere to COVID -19 procedures recruitment and baseline visits may be conducted remotely via 
telephone. Eligible participants will receive the consent form via DocuSign (or mail, if preferred and enough 
time is available) prior to meeting with research staff to allow time for review. Research staff will then 
conduct an informed consent process to ensure understanding from all participants. If consent was mailed, 
research staff must wait until signed consent is mailed back before continuing.  
Once informed consent is complete, research staff will then assess participants and deliver the intervention, 
respectively. Participants in the ORP arm will also receive an e -mail with the recovery handout . 
Follow- Up Visits  
In addition to the baseline visit, all follow up visits may be conducted remotely via telephone by [CONTACT_13916] (RA) or other staff member who is blinded to the participant’s group placement.  
 
Incentives 
Participants will receive a $ [ADDRESS_399380] for the Baseline visit , 4-week follow -up visit, and  12-week 
follow -up visit. Participants will receive a total of $1 50 for complet ing all study visits.  
Gift cards are ordered through the university’s Amazon account where a template is to be downloaded from 
the site, filled out, and uploaded back onto the site to initiate the ordering process.  
 

[ADDRESS_399381]. Bill Mihalko will monitor AEs (adverse events) for this study . 
If patients experience an adverse event during the study, we will conduct an assessment, complete an 
Adverse Event form, and follow the adverse event reporting system as required by [CONTACT_323555].  
Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject,  including any 
abnormal sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are any adverse event temporally associated with the  subject’s participation in 
research that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Results in a congenital anomaly  
• Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition  
All SAEs that are potentially related to the study are to be reported to the Project Coordinator (Ashley 
Cooper ) within one working day. The Project Coordinator will review and escalate to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_323540] ( Drs. Karen Derefinko and  Bill Mihalko) via email within 48 hours of  initial documentation. 
UTHSC’s IRB operating procedures regarding AE’s can be found here: https://www.uthsc.edu/research/compliance/irb/researchers/documents/adverse-event-reporting.pdf

TKR Database  
The database is located on filemaker, a file hosting application  on your UT computer/laptop . In order to 
access the database, the Research Manager has to request users to be added.

 Once added to the TKR  database, you will need to open filemaker and navigate to “File” at the top of your 
screen. Under “File” find “Hosts” and select “Show Hosts.” It should pop up a new screen. On the n ew screen, 
hit the plus in the left hand corner (beside the search hosts bar) and type in: “ filemaker.uthsc.edu” This 
should pull up several databases. (I suggest favoriting this host so you can easily access it in the future). You 
can either scroll or search for TKR to find the specific database : “CTSI TKR .” (You can also add this specific 
database to your favorites.)  
Now open the database by [CONTACT_323556]. You will log in with your UT net ID and password.

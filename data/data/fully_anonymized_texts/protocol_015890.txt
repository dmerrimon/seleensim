 4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.[ADDRESS_206779] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decad es [1].  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6] .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio 
of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_206780] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immu ne 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD _L2) 
[7; 8] .  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [9].  PD -1 and family members are 
type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the  binding of 
signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are 
involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [7; 10; 11; 12] .  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -
[ADDRESS_206781] from that of CTLA -4 as both 
molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [13; 14] .  PD -1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes including pe ripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T 
regs and Natural Killer cells [15; 16] .  Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells [17].  The ligands for PD-1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed 
or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in 
various tumors [13; 18; 19; 20] .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV - and I gC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic 
regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD ligand s to PD -[ADDRESS_206782] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is 
only detectably expressed on antigen -presentin g cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral 
tissues [13].  Although healthy organs  express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to 
regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) [21].  This

 suggests that the P D-1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. 
4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.[ADDRESS_206783] common cancer in the [LOCATION_002] [22].  The predominant 
histological type is transitional cell carcinoma accounting for > 90% of bladder tumors in 
Europe and [LOCATION_003].   Seventy percent of bladder tumors are superficial at presentation and 
include carcinoma in situ (cis), Ta, and T1 disease.  CIS of the bladder is a less common 
high-grade diffuse surface -spreading lesion confined to the u rothelium accounting for 1% to 
4% of the primary tumors and occurs concomitantly with a papi[INVESTIGATOR_176703] 13% to 20% of 
bladder cancer patients.  The remainder of superficial bladder cancers extend above the 
surface of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176704] (Ta), or invade into the submucosal layer (T1) 
without invading into the muscularis propria of the bladder wall.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_176705], 60% to 70% of superficial tumors recur, and 20% to 
30% of recurrent tumors will progr ess to a higher stage or grade [23].  For superficial urinary 
bladder cancer, one of the established primary treatment modalities involves the direct 
infusion of Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG) into the bladder, and this procedure is 
recommended to those with intermediate or high risk of recurrence or stage progression.  
BCG installation  has been used to treat non -muscle -invasive bladder cancer for more than [ADDRESS_206784] is still under investigation.   
Available evidence suggests that urothelial cells (including bladder cancer cells themselves) 
and cells of the immune system both have crucial roles in the therapeutic antitumor effec t of 
BCG. The possible involvement of bladder cancer cells includes attachment and 
internalization of BCG, secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and presentation of BCG 
and/or cancer cell antigens to cells of the immune system.  Immune system cell subsets  that 
have potential roles in BCG therapy include CD4  (+) and CD8  (+) lymphocytes, natural 
killer cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.  Bladder cancer cells are killed 
through direct cytotoxicity by [CONTACT_176727], by [CONTACT_176728] 
(tumo r necrosis factor -related apoptosis -inducing ligand), and, to some degree, by [CONTACT_176729] [24].  For bladder CIS, BCG is considered as the primary standard  [25] and 
the only treatment option available that has been shown to be effective aside from removing 
the bladder  [26].  BCG has also been shown to decrease the rate of progression  of superficial 
bladder cancer into more invasive forms of the disease  [27-31]; however, only t wo thirds of 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_206785] of the responders will develop recurrent disease, 
which is associated with a poor prognosis  [32; 33].  Given that the only other accepted 
standard treatment for high risk superficial urothelial cancer is radical cystectomy, 
identification of active agents in this disease is clearly warranted.  
The blockade of immune checkpoints of the pathway involving progr ammed death 1 ( PD-1) 
and its ligands, CD274 (PD -L1) and CD273 (PD -L2), has been shown recently to be 
effective in cancer therapy.  As more clinical trial s evaluating immune checkpoint -targeted 
drugs are published, the potential of these agents in managing treatment resistant cancers is 
becoming more obvious  [34; 35].  PD-1 is an inhibitory cell -surface receptor that can be 
stimulated to be expressed by T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, monocytes, and 
dendriti c cells (DC ) [29].  PDL2 is expressed mainly by [CONTACT_176730], whereas 
PDL -1 is widely expressed by [CONTACT_176731], non -hematopoietic, and tumor cells [36; 37 ].  
Higher expression of PDL -1 in ca ncer is associated with decreasing survival since tumors 
can evade the immune system by [CONTACT_176732]-1 [38-40].  Clinical trials with 
murine antibodies targeting PD-[ADDRESS_206786] cancer  - 
were all given anti -PD-L1 antibody.  The median duration of ther apy was 12 weeks (range, 2 
to 111).  Among patients with a response that could be evaluated, an objective response (a 
complete or partial response) was observed in [ADDRESS_206787] 1 year of follow -up [34].  
In a recent study presented in an abstract form at the 2014 annual meeting of the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology, humanized monoclonal IgG4 anti -PD-1 antibody MK -3475 
was administered to a non -randomized cohort of 411 ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naive (IPI -N) and IPI -
treated (IPI -T) melanoma patients.  The authors  observed that among the [ADDRESS_206788] was 40% (95% CI 32% -
48%) in IPI -N and 2 8% (95% CI 22% -35%) in IPI -T patients , and that the responses were 
durable .  Median progression free survival by [CONTACT_176733] 24 weeks in IPI -N and 23 weeks 
in IPI -T patients  and medi an overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 1 -year overall 
survival of 71% in all patients .  The authors then concluded that MK -3475 showed durable 
responses and a manageable safety profile across dose and schedules in IPI -N and IPI -T 
melanoma patients (http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/133842 -144).  
PD-L1 expression, a marker for response to anti -PD-1 agents, was observed in 7% of pTa, 
16% of pT1, and 45% of carcinoma in situ (CIS) tumors. PD -L1 expression in these tumors 
was also associated with hi gh-grade disease and tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_176734].  In 
addition, PD -L1 expression was found to be extremely abundant in the BCG -induced bladder 
granulomata in patients failing BCG treatment [41].  Recent pharmacokinetic studies  
showing efficacy of anti -PD-[ADDRESS_206789]:   MK-3475

Page 12 of 89 
 PD-1 agents 2-3 weeks  before BCG treatment, which would allow the bladder to  be primed 
for BCG with the hopes of a greater number of com plete responses to BCG [42].  This 
combination, if successful, could help patients avoid cystectomy; a complicated surgery with 
very high complication and readmission rates, and one that permanent ly alters a patient’s 
quality of life [43]. 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dos e Selection/Regimen/Modification  
The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W (every 3 weeks) of pembrolizumab is planned for all 
urothelial cancer trials.  Available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other 
solid tumor types support a lack of meaningful d ifference in PK exposures obtained at a 
given dose among tumor types.  An open -label Phase 1 trial (PN001) in melanoma subjects 
was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab.   
The dose escalation  portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 
mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.    All 
three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.    This 
first in human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective 
evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).    No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified.  
In KEYNOTE -001, two rand omized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed.    The 
clinical efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically important differences in 
efficacy response or safe ty profile at these doses.    For example, in Cohort B2, advanced 
melanoma subjects who had received prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_176706] 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W.    The overall response rate (ORR) was 
26% (21/81) in the 2 mg/kg group and 26% (25/79) in the 10 mg/kg group (full analysis set 
(FAS)).    The proportion of subjects with drug -related adverse events (AEs), grade 3 -5 drug -
related AEs, serious drug -related AEs, death or discontinuation due to an AE was 
comparable bet ween groups or lower in the 10 mg/kg group.  
Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid tumor 
types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokinetic exposures obtained at a 
given dose among tumor types.    Population PK analysis has been performed and has 
confirmed the expectation that intrinsic factors do not affect exposure to pembrolizumab to a 
clinically meaningful extent.    Taken together, these data support the use of lower doses (with 
similar exposure to 2 mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor indications.   The dose of   2 mg/kg 
Q3W is being evaluated in NSCLC in PN001, Cohort F30 and PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is 
being evaluated in head and neck cancer in PN012, which are expected to provide additional 
data support ing the dose selection.  
Selection of 200 mg as the appropriate dose for a switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulation results indicating that 200 mg will provide exposures that are reasonably 
consistent with those obtained with 2 mg/kg dose and important ly will maintain individual 
patient exposures within the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with 
maximal clinical response.    A population PK model, which characterized the influence of 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 13 of 89 
 body weight and other patient covariates on exposure , has been developed using available 
data from 476 subjects from PN001.    The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed 
dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose, with some 
tendency for individual values to range  slightly higher with the 200 mg fixed dose.   The 
slight increase in PK variability predicted for the fixed dose relative to weight -based dosing 
is not expected to be clinically important given that the range of individual exposures is well 
contained withi n the range of exposures shown in the melanoma studies of 2 and 10 mg/kg to 
provide similar efficacy and safety.    The population PK evaluation revealed that there was 
no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure.  In addition, exposure was similar 
between the NSCLC and melanoma indications.  Therefore, there are no anticipated changes 
in exposure between different tumor types and indication settings.  
To ensure the  safety and efficacy, the first [ADDRESS_206790] any significant safety or efficacy issues 
the dose will be escalated to 200 mg every 3 weeks.  
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Complete Response  Endpoint  
The study will determine the complete response  rate at [ADDRESS_206791]  long-term disease survival in 
patients with superficial bladder cancer .  Previous research showed up to a 50% recurrence 
rate at 3 months of follow -up in high risk superficial bladder cancer patients , which w as 
similar to the cohort of patients included in this study .  In a study by [CONTACT_176735]., a total of 
58 patients were e nrolled in  a study for gemcitabine  in superficial bladder cancer, and 47 
were evaluable for response.  Median patient age was 70 years (range 50 to 88).  Of the 
evaluable patients 42 (89%) had high risk disease, including high grade Ta in 12 (26%), high 
grade T1 in 2 (4%) and carcinoma in situ in 28 (60%) with or without papi[INVESTIGATOR_176707].  At 
the initial 3 -month evaluation  only 47% of patients were free of disease  [44].  Sylvetser et al. 
analyzed data on 2596 patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer, and derived  a 
simple s coring system based on six clinical and pathological factors: number of tumors, 
tumor size, prior recurrence  rate, T category, carcinoma in situ, and grade to predict 
recurrence.  The probabilities of recurrence  at one year  were up to 61% .  At five years, the 
probability of recurrence was up to  78 % [45].

 subjects’ germline DNA and formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue will be performed with 
correlation of mutations to  treatment outcomes  of both BCG and MK-3475 .

Period  Use 
MK-3475a, b [ADDRESS_206813] enrolled.  
b The MK -3475 dosing interval may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5.2. 3.3.  BCG 
treatment may be interrupted or delayed as  per the instructions for use supplied with BCG  (Section [IP_ADDRESS].3) . 
BCG: One vial of BCG suspended in 50 ml preservative -free saline.  BCG is to be given through a urinary 
catheter (intravesically) into the bladder.  BCG treatment will occur once per week for [ADDRESS_206814] cycle of treatment with MK -3475, Week 7.  BCG is a FDA approved 
treatment and will  be supplied commercially through the study site pharmacy.  
5.2.1 BCG Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  BCG treatment will be according to Insti tutional standard for the site ; 
however, the BCG will be provided by [CONTACT_176738].  
For pati ents with multi -focal disease, it is highly recommended that the patient have a 
urologic stent and catheter placed prior to the first pembrolizumab treatment to allow 
for stabilization of the mucosa prior to the start of treatment with BCG.  Placement will  
be at the discretion of the treating physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Dose Selection  
The rationale for the use of the indicated dose of BCG is based upon FDA approved and 
commercially provided package insert/instructions for use of the product.  Dosing for the 
intravesical tre atment of carcinoma in situ and for the prophylaxis of recurrent papi[INVESTIGATOR_176709] [ADDRESS_206815]:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_206816] 
treatment with more than one vial to ensure treatment of all tumor sites (generally kidney or 
ureter in addition to bladder).  Essentially to allow for proper treatment, it  is anticipated that 
one vial will be used to treat each organ/distinct urologic structure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Preparation  
Consult  FDA approved package insert for instructions on BCG preparation  (Appendix C  has 
the insert for TICE® BCG, there are other manufacturers of BCG t hat may also be utilized .) 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Dose Delay  
BCG treatment  will be w ithheld for Grade >2 hematuria, Grade  >1 fever and drug-related 
Grade 4 hematologic toxicities, and all other non-hematological toxicity  Grade  ≥[ADDRESS_206817] resolution to Grade < 1.  The treating Investigator  who is a  
qualified  physician may delay treatment for Grade [ADDRESS_206818] of the patient.  In the event of a grade 1 or 2  
immune related adverse event requiring corticosteroid treatment, BCG treatment may  be 
delayed for up to 2 weeks with the expectation that steroid treatment will be discontinued 
prior to the  next BCG treatment cycle.   A delay of longer than 2 weeks will permanently 
discontinue the patient from BCG treatment within the study or permanent withdrawal of the 
patient from the study.  The choice will be at the discretion of the treating Investigat or.  
Steroid treatment for grade 3 or higher immune mediated events will require discontinuation 
of BCG treatment and/or withdrawal from the study.  
Instillation of BCG with an actively bleeding mucosa may promote systemic BCG infection.   
Therefore, treatment will be postponed for at least two weeks following transurethral 
resection, biopsy, traumatic catheterization, or gross hematuria.  
Patients will be  asked to report any fever or  flu-like symptoms to their treating Investigator  
immediately , as well as any systemic manifestations increasing in intensity with repeated 
instillations, or local symptoms (frequency, urgency, burning sensation with urination)  
lasting more than 2 -3 days.  If a patient develops persistent fever or experiences an acute 
febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, BCG treatment will be discontinued and the 
patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic infection.  Intravesical instillations of 
BCG will also be postponed during treatment with antibiotics, since antimicrobial therapy 
may interfere with the effectiveness of BCG.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Monitoring for Systemic Dissemination of BCG  
To ensure early identification of systemic BCG  infection, subjects will be monitored for 
symptoms of systemic infection.  For each cycle of BCG treatment, subjects will be 
telephoned on Days 2 -4 (Treatment is Day 1) of Treatment Weeks [ADDRESS_206819]:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_206820] oral temperatures each morning and evening 
throughout the BCG treatment (Weeks 7 -12) and for recording of any other symptoms they 
may be experiencing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing of  Dose Administration  
BCG  treatment should be administered  beginning on D ay 1 of Cycle 3 (Week 7) of MK -3475 
after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 7.0).  BCG treatment will be repeated every 7 days  at weeks 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 . 
BCG  treatment may be administered up to 1 day before or after the scheduled date (at 7 days) 
due to administrative reasons . 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis  and according to i nstitutional 
standards  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug/Treatment  
BCG is given through a urinary catheter (intravesically) into the bladder .  BCG will be 
instilled into the bladder according to institutional standards based on FDA approved 
indications for treatment of bladder cancer.  Additional lesions in patients with multi -focal 
disease will be treated per intuitional standard s and directed by [CONTACT_176739].  The 
treatment will be given once a week for 6 weeks.

symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_176711] [ADDRESS_206821] be postponed until urine 
is clear again.  See dose mod ification/delay  (section 5.2. 1.5) for further instruction.  No dose 
reduction or antibiotic treatment has been proven to prevent or decrease bladder irritation 
related to BCG . 
Subjects may develop “Flu -like” symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which ofte n reflect 
hypersensitivity reactions, and can be treated symptomatically with antihistamines  
(Prophylactic treatment with antihistamine before subsequent BCG courses is left to the 
discretion of the provider .). 
The most serious complication of BCG is disseminated BCG sepsis with associated 
mortality.  In addition, infections have been reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, 
kidney, regional lymph nodes, and prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG.  
Some male genitourinary tract infections (orchitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_95541]) have been resistant to 
multiple drug anti -tuberculous therapy and required orchiectomy.  These complications were 
reported in less than 1% of patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification for BCG  
BCG dos e modification has not been shown to reduce toxicity ; therefore, no dose 
modifications will be attempted in this trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Over Dosage  
Over dosage occurs if more than one vial (per treated organ/ urologic structure) of BCG is 
administered per instillation.  If over dosage occurs, the patient should be closely monitored 
for signs of active local or systemic BCG infection.  For acute local or systemic reactions 
Product:   MK-3475

 scheduled interruption, unless otherwise di scussed with the Sponsor.  The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
5.2.4 Schedule Modification for Combination Therapy  
The dosing schedule of the combination therapy will not be altered except on an individual 
drug basis ( such as holding either individual BCG or MK -3475 therapy) if the time period is 
for [ADDRESS_206831] the dosage schedule for the 
other medication.  Patients will be discontinued from the trial if one of the two medications is 
held for more than 2 weeks be cause of toxicity.  BCG treatment may continue, after a 2 week 
hold, outside of the study at the discretion of the treating Investigator . 
5.2.5 Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial MK-3475 treatment  (100 or 200 mg fixed dose)  should be administered on Day 1 of 
each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial 
Flow Chart (Section 7.0).  MK-3475  treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or 
after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons .  Subjects may be 
dosed no less than 18 days from the previous dose.  If treatment is held for greater than 3 
cycles (or 63 days) subject will be withdrawn from investigational product treatment 
permanently.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis  unless the patient is currently 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176712]-3475 or enrollment into the study.  
MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment cycle intervals may be 
increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5.2. 3.3).  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the 
variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of −5 minutes and +10 minutes is 
permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: −5 min/+10 min).  
The Procedure Manual contains specific instructions for MK -3475 dose calculation, 
reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.  
5.2.6 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, Investigator  and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria ar e not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The Investigator  should discuss any questions regarding this 
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 25 of 89 
 with the Sponsor .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
Investigator  and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy o r vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the subject.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_206832]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretio n of the Investigator  in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) , 
including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids .  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug , dosage, 
frequency, route, and date should  also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_206833] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 9.0. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohib ited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:

 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than MK -3475  
 Radiation therapy  
 Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_206834] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.    Examples of live vaccines include, b ut are not limited to, the 
following:   measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG (with the 
exclusion of BCG for treatment ), and typhoi d (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines 
for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and  are allowed; however , intranasal 
influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
 Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of steroids for treatment of 
a grade [ADDRESS_206835]:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 26 of 89 
 patient from BCG treatment within the study or permanent withdrawal of the patient from 
the study.  The choice will be at the discretion of the treating Investigator .  Steroid 
treatment for grade 3 or higher immune medi ated events will require discontinuation of 
BCG treatment and/or withdrawal from the study.  
 The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with 
the Sponsor.  
 Drug combinations containing immunosuppressants and/or bone mar row depressants 
and/or radiation.  The above mentioned therapi[INVESTIGATOR_176713] . 
 Antimicrobial therapy may interfere with the effectiveness of BCG treatment.  If 
antimicr obial therapy is required, BCG treatment should be delayed as appropriate.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_737], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial  
treatment or delayed in the case of antimicrobial treatment .  Subjects may receive other 
medications that the Investigator  deems to be medically necessary.

There are no prohibited ther api[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.4.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measu res for the management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below.  Where appropriate, t hese 
guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti -inflammatory agents if sy mptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms 
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be made 
to rule out other causes su ch as metastatic disease  or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care.   The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when 
the Investigator  determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
Investigator  does not need to follow the treatment guidance  (as outlined 
below) .  Refer to Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_206836]:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 27 of 89 
  Pneumonitis : 
 For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids.  When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
 Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections  in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration . 
 Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subject s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
 All subject s who experience diarrhea /colitis  should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid 
and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.   For Grade 2 or higher 
diarrhea, consider GI consu ltation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out 
colitis.  
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with intravenous steroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78018] . 
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or  less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset , including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] ) or 
≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia , if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis (DKA)  
 For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes 
mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 Hypophysitis : 
 For Grade [ADDRESS_206837]:   MK-3475

Page 28 of 89 
  For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed 
by [CONTACT_78019].  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no  less than 4 weeks.  Replacement 
of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism : 
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.  Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, 
and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of 
thyroid disorders.  
 Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective bet a-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corti costeroid followed by [CONTACT_79918].  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is tapered.  
 Hepatic : 
 For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
 When symptoms impro ve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
 For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.

 Supportive Care for Suspected Primary Adrenal Insufficiency  
If symptoms are suggest ive of an endocrinopathy and the patient is not in adrenal 
crisis, endocrine laboratory results should be evaluated before corticosteroid therapy 
is initiated.  Endocrine work -up will include TSH and free T4 levels to determine if 
thyroid abnormalities are  present.  TSH, prolactin, ACTH, and a morning cortisol 
level will help to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_12978].  Grade [ADDRESS_206840]; otherwise, short -term, 
high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4 mg every six hours or equivalent) 
with relevant hormone replacement (e.g., levoth yroxine, hydrocortisone, sex 
hormones) will be  administered .  Patients  in adrenal crisis (characterized by a 
constellation of symptoms suggestive of severe dehydratio n, hypotension, or shock) 
will be treated as a medical emergency and given intravenous inj ections of 
glucocorticoids and large volumes of intravenous saline solution with dextrose.

5.5.[ADDRESS_206842] azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).  
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses w ithout an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement the rapy.  In the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR 
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176715]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
OR 
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant 
or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_206843] dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:  
(1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.  
Acceptable  methods of contraception  are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine device  (IUD)  
Product:   MK-3475   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 32 of 89 
 • vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
• diaphragm with spermici de (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)  
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ( estrogen /progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870] -
only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or  subcutaneous  
contraceptive injection  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contracepti on if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation 
methods, etc.) and wit hdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects 
participating at sites in this countr y/region.  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study , subjects of childbearing potential  must adhere t o the contraception requirement 
(described above) from  the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the 
initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout  the study  period up to [ADDRESS_206844]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be r eported to the Sponsor and to 
manufacturer’s safety division  without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious 
adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -
threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The study Investigator  will make every

Section 9.1.2. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_206846] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the tria l at the 
discretion of the Investigator  should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_121274], the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or ot her safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

 8.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
8.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 7.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in  detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_176745].  In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially 
sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that 
additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/ testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
8.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial . 
The principles  of informed  consent  are described  by [CONTACT_176746]  (Code of 
Federal Regulations, Title 21, Volume 1, Part  50, Revised April 1, 2013 ) and the Office  for 
Human  Research  Protections  (Code  of Federal  Regulations  45 CFR  46).  They  must  be 
followed  to comply  with federal  regulations  for the conduct  and monitoring  of clinical  
investigations.

acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  The case history for each  subject shall 
document that  informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study and before 
any study related procedure(s) was performed.   Original  signed  consent  forms  must  be filed 
in the site study  binder  or in each subject’s  study  file. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the subject must re ceive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to cont inue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent

Patients who “no show” for more than 1 required visit for non -emergent or non -health related 
events may be considered non -compliant and discontinued from the study at the discretion of 
the treating Investigator . 
8.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
Subjects diagnosed with T1 and Ta tumors require restaging after failure of BCG and one 
course of maintenance or failure after BCG plus one of the following: mitomycin, 
gemcitabine, or BCG/interferon .  Subjects receiving bladder tumor resection at outside 
institutions are eligible for  the study ; however, pathology slides must be reviewed by [CONTACT_39722]’s pathology department .  Each subject  will receive a total of 6 cycles of treatment with 
MK-3475 at a dose of 100 (first 3 subjects) or 200 mg  on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle .  Two 
cycles of MK -3475 will occur prior to BCG intravesical treatment (weekly doses for 6 
weeks) with concurrent treatment (MK -3475 and BCG) starting on cycle [ADDRESS_206870]:   MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 45 of 89 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Transurethral Resection of Tumor  
Trans urethral resection of bladder tumor is routine care for this population .  Generally 
superficial bladder cancer subjects have [ADDRESS_206871]  resection ; 
however, timing may be extended if the subject is refer red from an external clinic.  A repeat  
resection may occur as part of restaging for recurrent/persistent disease  after failed 
intervesical therapy to confirm pathology and cytology for localized  high grade (G3) 
transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carci noma) of the bladder that is stage Ta, T1, and/or 
CIS. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new 
or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently , if clinically 
indicated.  Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during 
the follow -up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 ( Appendix E).  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken 
with regard to trial treatment.  AEs will be recorded  from the time the subject signs  the 
consent through [ADDRESS_206872] study treatme nt. 
Please refer to section 9.0 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Full Physical Exam ination  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam ination  
including vital signs (heart rate, blood p ressure, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])  during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam ination  should  be performed during screening  and the 30 day

For cycles that do not require a full physical exam ination  per the Trial Flow Chart, the 
Investigator  or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam ination  as clinically 
indicated prior to trial treatment administration.  Directed physical exam ination s will also 
collect vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
The Investigator  or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dos e of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 7.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only.

prior to the administration of trial treatment at Week 7, Week 13, Week 19 and 
discontinuation of trial treatment  or Sa fety Follow up visit  as specified in the Trial Flow 
Chart.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Twelve -Lead Electrocardiograms  (ECG)  
During the screening period, a [ADDRESS_206873].  Interpretation may be by [CONTACT_176751] a qualified designee.   ECGs completed within 90 days of the screening visit 
will be acceptable for the study, unless a suspected cardiac event has occurred in that 90 day 
period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Chest X -Ray 
A chest X-ray, both PA and lateral views, will occur at screening to confirm non -metastatic 
disease as well as to provide a baseline evaluation for pulmonary status.   X-Rays completed 
within the 90 days prior to the screening visit are acceptable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pulmonary Function Tests  (PFT) 
Baseline PFTs will occur at screening to assess lung volume, capacity, rate of flow, and gas 
exchange.  Throughout the course of the study , additional PFTs will be performed if 
clinically indicated.  If DLCO decreases by [CONTACT_7809] 10% , the subject wi ll be considered 
to have interstitial lung disease if no other obvious reason for the decrease.  The following 
will be collected:  
 Vital Capacity (VC)  
 Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawa l should be 
followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 9.0 − Assessing and 
Recording Adverse Events.  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, and without prejudice to 
further treatment.    In addition, patients can be withdrawn by [CONTACT_176754].    Patients who are withdrawn or are removed from the study will be 
required to have an off -study clinic v isit at the time of discontinuation, and a 30 -day follow -
up safety visit.  
Subjects  can be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
Adverse Event:  If a subject  suffers an adverse event, which in the judgment of the 
Investigator, the Study Sponsor, or the Data Safety Review Team  presents an 
unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject , the subject  can be withdrawn from 
the study.  
Administrative:  After consultation, a subject  can be withdrawn from the study for 
the following administr ative reasons: 1) failure to complete the protocol -specified 
evaluations or 2) failure to comply with protocol requirements.  
Withdrawal of Informed Consent:  A subject  can withdraw his consent to 
participate in the study at his own request or be withdrawn f rom participation in the 
study at the request of his legally authorized representative at any time for any reason.  
Evidence of Progressive Disease:  The Investigator  can withdraw a subject  from the 
study if there is a CT scan, MRI or other modality -confirme d progression of disease , 
but continue to collect follow -up data for safety and overall survival as per protocol.  
Subject s must  be withdrawn/ discontinued from the treatment for the following reasons:

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Screening  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Screening Period  
The screening period covers the 90 days prior to Day 1 , Cycle 1.  Days −90 through −[ADDRESS_206879]  occur in the 28 days prior to Day 1 , Cycle 1 
of treatment.  The study screening visit includes full study informed consent and 
documentation of consent.  No study required procedures (excluding those that are standard 
of care) are to occur prior to inform ed consent of the subject.  All inclusion/exclusion criteria 
must be reviewed and all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria must be met to 
advance the subject on to the Treatment Period.  The screening period procedures include: 
full study in formed consent, review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
demographics and medical history, concomitant medication review, cystoscopy and urine 
cytology, including restaging of tumor for Ta and T1 , review of ongoing symptoms for 
documentatio n of baseline adverse effects, full physical examina tion, ECOG performance 
status, v ital signs, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and baseline pulmonary function tests  as 
well as laboratory assessments indicated in Section 7−Trial Flow Chart .  Collection of a 
baseline bladder cancer tumor specimen, as well as baseline blood and urine specimens for 
correlative studies , will also occur during the screening period.  Assessment of coagulation 
status will be performed prior to each res ection as per standard of car e. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_206880] of the three require s the dose of MK -3475 to be withheld or 
discontinued, the 100 mg cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects.  If two out of three or two 
out of six subjects develop toxicity that requires the dose to be withheld or discontinued, the 
dose will be not be escalated to 200 mg MK -3475 every  3 weeks.  All remaining subjects 
will be treated at 100 mg MK -3475 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  
Physical examination and assessment of toxicity will be performed before each 
administration of MK -3475.  A CBC will be obtained on Day 1 of every 3 -week cycle.   
Biochemistry panel examining electrolytes, and liver enzymes will be performed on Day 1 , 
Cycle 1  of MK -3475, at Weeks 7, 10  and 13, and at the end of therapy  (Week 19) .  
Treatment will not proceed unless laboratory values are acceptable.  Urinalysis will  occur at 
weeks [ADDRESS_206881] non -serious and serious adverse events and 
assignment of toxi city grade (NCI CTCAE, Version 4) at each visit.  Collect and record any 
changes in concomitant mediation.

 Subjects will be provided with an oral thermometer and a diary (Appendix H) to document 
twice daily oral temperatures.  The diary will also ask for documentation of other symptoms 
to help monitor for systemic infection of BCG.  
The AUA IPSS and QOL questionnaires are to b e administered at Day 1 Cycle 1 and  Week 
10 visit prior to any study procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Phone Monitoring  
To monitor for systemic BCG infection, subjects will be called daily on days 2 -4 of each 
BCG treatment cycle (Weeks 7 -12).  Subjects will be queried on symptoms which may 
indicate  systemic infection .  If clinically indicated, subject will be seen and clini cally worked 
up for systemic infection and treatment started as indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unplanned Visits  
Unplanned visit  information will be collected as well.  Information collected will include: 
disease symptoms and assessment/status, laboratory /imaging  assessments, and toxicity 
assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post-Treatment Visits  
An evaluation under anesthesia with cystoscopy, cytology, and random bladder biopsies (if 
indicated for positive findings on cystoscopy or cytology) will be performed at Week 19 
(approximately [ADDRESS_206882] dose of BCG)  to assess for response.   Physical 
examination, performance status, as well as vital signs , will also be assessed at the Week 19 
visit.  Laboratory assessments will include hematology and chemistry as outlined in Section 7 
– Trial Flow Chart and Table 7.  Coagulation assessment (PT/PTT/INR) will be re -assessed , 
if resection/biopsy is indicated.  Specimens need ed for correlative studies will again be 
collected, including blood, urine, saliva and tumor (if biopsy is performed).  The collection, 
storage , and processing of laboratory samples are detailed in the Procedure Manual.  
The AUA IPSS and QOL questionnaires are also to be administered at Week 19  visit prior to 
any study procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Discontinuation/Safety Follow -Up Visit  
The Treatment Discontinuation Visit and Safety Follow -Up Visit include identical 
procedures and assessments.  Subjects withdrawn f rom treatment prior to completion of the 
Treatment Period should undergo a Discontinuation Visit for safety purposes and  may occur 
any time within [ADDRESS_206883].  All AEs that occur prior to the Safety 
Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade >[ADDRESS_206884]:   MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_206885].  SAEs that occur within 30 days of the end of treatment or before 
initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment should also be followed and recorded.  
Assessments at the Discontinuatio n/Safety Follow -Up Visit include a full physical 
examination, ECOG Performance Status and vital signs.  Laboratory assessments include 
hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis, as well as evaluation of thyroid function.  
Concomitant medications and toxicity a ssessment will be recorded as well.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up Visits  
Subjects who complete all study treatment or discontinue trial treatment for a reason other 
than disease progression will move into the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed at [ADDRESS_206886] a causal relations hip with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -
specified pro cedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with  the 
use of the  investigational product, is also an adverse event.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_26336] a physiologically appropriate time.  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of investigational  product in clin ical 
trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), 
from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Progression of the cancer under study is n ot considered an adverse event.  
All adverse  events that occur after the consent  form is signed , but before treatment 
allocation /randomization , must be reported by [CONTACT_176755], or are the  result of a protocol -specified intervention, including , but

 not limited to , washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure.  
From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_206887] be reported by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  Such events will be 
recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.   The 
reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious crit eria is described in section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screeni ng period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any 
protocol -specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide con sent to the main study and AEs 
will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
9.1.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to 
the Sponsor  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exce eding the prescribed 
dose for MK -3475 by 20% over the prescribed dose  and an overdose of BCG is considered 
more than one vial of BCG administered per instillation , unless a greater number of vials are 
prescribed due to multi -focal disease . 
In the event of an overdose, the event should be reported to the Sponsor and the  subject 
should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided , if clinically indicated.   No specific information is available on the treatment  of 
overdose of MK -3475.   If over dosage of BCG occurs, the patient should be closely 
monitored for signs of active local or systemic BCG infection.  For acute local or systemic 
reactions suggesting active infection, an infectious disease specialist experi enced in BCG 
complications should be consulted.  
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a study  drug, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria 
are met.  
If a dose o f an investigational product  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is 
reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “ac cidental 
or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to the manufacturer’s safety division  (For [COMPANY_006] 
products this is [COMPANY_006] Global Safety, Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) .

Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed , but before treatment 
allocation/randomization , must be reported by [CONTACT_176755], or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including , but 
not limited to , washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure.  
Pregnancies and  lactations that o ccur from the time of treatment a llocation/randomization 
through [ADDRESS_206889] be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intr auterine death, 
miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within [ADDRESS_206890]’s manufacturer safety division . 
9.1.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring while the subject is enrolled into the 
study that: 
 Results in death;  
 Is life threatening;  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Is another important medical event  
Note:  In addition to  the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below 
criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in 
the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements.  Therefore, 
these events are considered serious  by [CONTACT_131892].

a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causali ty noted on the AE form, ensures that a 
medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must b e retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the Investigator  in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the 
available informa tion.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between [COMPANY_006]  product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely [COMPANY_006]  product caused the  adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance asses sment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite i n bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of [COMPANY_006]  product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
Product:   MK-3475 60 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 60 of 89 
  Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental 
factors  
 
Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)  
to [COMPANY_006] 
Product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was [COMPANY_006]  product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improve d despi[INVESTIGATOR_121256]’s product; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor’s produ ct(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is  a single -dose drug trial); or 
(3) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERS E EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN 
CAUSED BY [CONTACT_176756], OR IF REEXPOSURE TO MERCK  PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK 
TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_176757].  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding [COMPANY_006] product or drug class pharmacology or 
toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_121284] a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, including 
consideration of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of product relationship.  There is evidence of exposure to [COMPANY_006]  product.  The temporal sequ ence of the AE onset relative to the administration of [COMPANY_006]  product is 
reasonable.  The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_78034].  
No, there is not a reasonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006] product 
relationship  Subject did not receive the product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of [COMPANY_006]  product is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_78035].   (Also entered for a subject with overdose w ithout an associated AE.)

 9.1.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and Investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.   If appropriate , adverse events will be 
reported to the drug manufacturer’s safety division.  
10.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
10.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
A minimum of 15 subjects will be enrolled.  Seventy percent of bladder tumors are superficial 
[22] indicating to enroll at least [ADDRESS_206900].  
Fifty percent of those patients wh o respond to BCG treatment develop recurrent disease [30; 31]  
generally detected within [ADDRESS_206901] in determin ing patient 
eligibility (recurrent superficial bladder cancer versus initial diagnosis) and considerations for 
future study  design . 
Patient related data will be collected and transferred to an excel spreadsheet for statistical 
analysis.  SAS software versio n 9.4 will be used for all data analysis.  Descriptive statistics will 
be computed for all study variables.  Continuous variables will be described with measures of 
central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (range, standard deviation).   Categorical 
variables will be summarized as frequencies and percentages.  Some examples include tumor 
stage (Ta, T1, Cis), age, ECOG Performance Scale (0, 1, 2), sex, and use of tobacco and alcohol.  
For primary objective 1, the proportion of patients with each AE will b e reported along with the 
NCI CTCAE Grade of the AE.   The Quality of Life Questionnaire, which includes one question 
with seven categorical responses, will be described with frequencies  and percentages.  The 
American Urologic Association Symptoms Index Questionnaire, which includes seven questions 
each with a numerical score between 0 and 5 as well as a final numerical sum of all responses, 
will be described with measures of central tendency and dispersion.  Due to the questionnaires 
being given at three  time points (Pre -treatment, Mid -treatment, and Post -treatment), the 
responses may be analyzed to look for longitudinal effects over time for specific variables of 
interest with repeated measures ANOVA to evaluate changes and control for individual 
differe nces ( although this would be very low power  due to n=15 ). 
For the secondary objective, subjects will be assessed at [ADDRESS_206902]:   MK-3475 62 
Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 62 of 89 
 These proportions/percent will be reported, but no stati stical analysis will be perfor med as this is 
a single arm phase I study, and no control group is available for direct comparison.  
For the exploratory objectives, Pearson or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient will be used to 
estimate correlations between expression level change and  treatment outcome, as well as the 
correlations between mutation presence and treatment outcome.

 APPENDIX B  
Calculation of CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_176721]://www.qxmd.com/calculate -online/nephrology/ckd -epi-egfr 
The CKD -EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444]) equation was developed in 
an effort to create a formula more precise than the MDRD formula, especially w hen actual GFR 
is > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.  Researchers pooled data from multiple studies to develop and 
validate this new equation.  They randomly divided 10 studies , which included 8,254 
participants, into separate data sets for development and internal validation.  Sixteen ( 16) 
additional studies, which included 3,[ADDRESS_206925] (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
Study) equation, especially at higher GFR, with less bias and greater accuracy.  When looking at 
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data, the median estimated GFR 
was 94.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 vs. 85.0 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and the prevalence of chronic kidney 
disease was 11.5% versus  13.1%.  The CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908], expressed as a single equation, is:  
GFR = 141 X min(Scr/κ,1)α X max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 X 0.993Age X 1.018 [if female] X 1.159 [if 
black]  
Where Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is –0.329 for 
females and –0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the 
maximum of Scr/κ or 1.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_206931] will involve baking formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections for 45 
minutes at 60 °C, then deparaffinized and rehydrated with serial passage through changes of 
xylene and graded ethanols.  All slides will be subjected to heat induced epi[INVESTIGATOR_176722], High pH (cat K8012, Dako, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_176723]) 
or Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.1 (cat S1699, Dako).  Endogenous peroxidase in tissues will 
be blocked by [CONTACT_176762] 3% hydrogen peroxide solution prior to incubation with 
primary antibody (anti -PD-L1 clone 22C3, [COMPANY_006] Research Laboratories, Palo Alto CA; anti -
PD-1 clone NAT105, Cell Marque, Rocklin CA; or anti -CD3 clone F7.2.38, Dako) for 60 
minutes.   Antigen -antibody binding will be detected using polymer -based methods and 
visualized by [CONTACT_38658] 3,3' diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen (K4368, Dako).    Stained 
slides will be counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped for review and scoring by a 
pathologist employing a semiquantitative 0 -5 scale.  
Specimens collected from biopsy (formalin fixed tissue blocks and slides) obtained at baseline 
(utilizing the specimen ICF form or the main study ICF) and Week 19 (main study ICF) will be 
utilized for the completion of Basic Science Correlates, Objective 1.  
Objective 2.  Whole exome sequencing of germline DNA and formalin fixed, 
paraffin embedded tissue on all  patients.  Correlation will be made to mutations 
and treatment outcomes.  
The study Investigators are submitting a protocol that allows for DNA collection from 
genitourinary cancer patients.  The same protocol will allow for collection of clinical data and  
DNA sequencing using next generation technology from patients who received MK-[ADDRESS_206932] -MK-3475  tumor resections and biopsies will be obtained.  
Response/no response to MK-3475  will be ascertained from the collected clini cal data using 
definitions of response agreed on for high risk superficial bladder cancer.  Germline DNA from 
patients with a complete set of data will be sequenced using next generation sequencing (exome 
sequencing at 40x) provided by [CONTACT_176763] ( such as www.edgebio.com).  Data from next 
generation sequencing will be analyzed using software provided by [CONTACT_176764]. 
(www.ingenuity.com).  Variants will be analyzed both in an agnostic and non -agnostic manners.  
Any genes reported in the literature t o be associated with response to PDL -1 therapy will be 
examined to agnostically identify variants within these genes shared between responders/no 
responders to MK-3475  at a significant level.  In addition, genetic variants common to 
responders/non responde rs and unrelated to genes identified previously in the literature as being

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019

 related to PDL -1 response will be examined (non -agnostic analysis).  Such non -agnostic variants 
will be also considered as important targets for biomarker development if they are si gnificantly 
associated with response/no response to treatment.  Variants associated with response/no 
response will be then validated in the discovery cohort using sequenome analysis 
(www.sequenome.com ) as agreed upo n in the scientific methodology of such studies to avoid 
replicating variants that do not actually exist in the sampled DNA.  
Specimens (including tumor and surrounding normal tissue, whole blood, serum, and urine) will 
be collected for future unspecified r esearch if the subject agrees to collection and storage for 
future unspecified research.  Specimens may come from subjects fully enrolled in the treatment 
portion of the study at baseline and Week 19.  Specimens may also be obtained from subjects 
who have declined the treatment portion of the study or were ineligible , but gave permission for 
use of specimens despi[INVESTIGATOR_176724].  The 
specimens will be stored until completely utilized or for [ADDRESS_206933] common cancer in the [LOCATION_002]. (1) The majority of 
diagnoses are non -muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), however a significant proportion of 
these cases will recur and some  will ultimately become muscle invasive. (2) Thus, prevention of 
post-transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) recurrence of intermediate risk NMIBC 
would represent a major step towards reduction of bladder cancer mortality. Intravesical 
instillation of BCG represents first line treatment for NMIBC and is effective in preventing 
recurrence of superficial disease. (3) This is thought to elicit an immune reaction and the release 
of cytokines that active an immune response from neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. (3)  
Recently, there have been advances in the treatment of advanced bladder tumors with agents 
targeting the programmed cell death protein (PD -1)/programmed cell death ligand (PDL -1) 
checkpoint pathway. (4) By [CONTACT_176765], a greater antitumor response by T cells is 
created resulting in incre ased bladder cancer cell immune mediated destruction. (5) We have  a 
phase I clinical study examining the results of combining pembrolizumab, a monoclonal anti -
PD1 antibody, with BCG treatments. In these patients, we have collected both urine and blood 
pre- and post -treatment. The urine in these patients contains the bla dder inflammatory exudate 
that developed during treatment. We hypothesize that  the understanding of  how combined 
BCG and pembrolizumab treatment affect the local (bladder exudate in urine) and 
systemic (blood) immune environment could be obtained from immu ne-profiling bodily 
fluids of our trial patients.  
Our collaborator, [CONTACT_176769] from IncellDx has developed a high parameter flow 
cytometry assay for immune profiling in solid tumors and urine. In a lung study that combined 
primary tumor immune pro filing and Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) analysis, they were able to

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Amendment 5, 21 October 2019   
 
Page 81 of 89 
 identify both drug targets in the primary tumors and factors in the primary tumor that diminished 
immune control of tumor cells that led to detection of CTCs especially CTCs expressing PD -L1. 
We will use the patient samples derived from our phase I study and perform high parameter (>20 
markers)  analysis of urine and blood samples,  below, both pre - and post -treatment  to quantify the  
 
 immune cell sub -populations to create an immune profile. Furthermore, we will analyze serum 
cytokines to further establish immune response in patients. We will also compare the immune 
profiles for treatment responders and non -responders to determine if there are biomarkers for 
predicting respo nse to this combined treatment modality much like we had done previously to 
identify immune control in the lung (below).  
 
 
We will use the patient samples derived from our phase I study and perform FACS analysis to 
sort urine and blood samples, both pre - and post -treatment, into immune cell sub -populations to 
create an immune profile. Furthermore, we will analyze serum cytokines to further establish

addition, we will perform Luminex Assays on patient serum samples to determine cytokine 
profiling (IL -1beta, IL -1ra, IL -2, IL -4, IL -6, IL -8, IL -10, IL -13, IL -17A, GM -CSF, IFN -gamma, 
TNF -alpha). We will examine immune profiles pre - and post - treatments as well as comparing 
the immune profiles between patients that respond to treatment (ie no tumor recurrence) with 
patients that have tumor recurrence.

Our collaborator’s laboratory is experienced in isolating immune cells from patient samples and 
performing FACS analysis. The antibodies we intend to use for staining have all been tested. 
Though the fundamental groundwork for success may be in place, potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_176725].  
Even though we plan to spin down samples, this does not necessarily mean cells will be present 
in sufficient numbers to perform our experiments. Giv en most patient samples were collected 
and frozen prior to analysis, there is risk of cell lysis compromising analysis. If this occurs, we 
may be required to change buffering solutions used prior to freezing.

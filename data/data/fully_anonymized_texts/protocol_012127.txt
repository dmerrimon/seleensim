 Statistical 
Methodology  For assessing the primary endpoint, we will calculate an odds ratio (with a 
95% confidence interval) for transfusion with p -values calculated using a 
likelihood ratio.  
Data and Safety 
Monitoring  Monitoring of adverse even ts will occur every 6 months over the course of the 
study or more frequently if needed. One interim analysis is planned to assess 
the primary endpoint for significant efficacy sufficient to stop the trial early. 
The interim analysis is planned for the ¾ po int of the trial or a minimum of 
300 subjects enrolled . 
 
Background and Study Rationale  
1 Introduction  
Geriatric hip fracture patients may significantly benefit from routine administration of tranexamic 
acid (TXA)  prior to the procedure to decrease the risk  of blood loss. Thus, this may further reduce 
the rate of blood transfusions and complications associated with this treatment. With the high volume of geriatric hip fractures treated at Lancaster General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  we would obtain a large 
patient population  to perform an ideal study .

decade. This population has a significant increase  in morbidity and mortality (approximately 50%) 
within [ADDRESS_206152] -operative  blood transfusions also increase 
the risk of infectious and non -infectious  complications  (i.e. anaphylaxis, acute hemolytic r eaction, 
circulatory overload, metabolic derangements, etc.), cost of admission, and length of stay  in this 
population.6-[ADDRESS_206153] be cautious and aware 
of risks when deciding if transfusions are indicated for this population.  
  
Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti -fibrinolytic medication that has transformed total joint replacement 
management regarding  blood loss pr evention. Multiple studies have proven its effectiveness of 
significantly reducing blood loss during total hip and knee replacement procedures compared to placebo.
12-[ADDRESS_206154] significant anemia because joint replacement surgeries are generally elective and not urgent or 
emergent.  
  
Geriatric patients requiring emergent hip fracture repair may significantly benefit from routine 
administration of TXA prior to the procedure to decrease the ri sk of blood loss. Thus, treatment  may 
TAHFT   Page 6 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_206155] shortcoming in the literature is the lack of high level evidence to support the use of TXA 
in patient s with a history of VTE, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, transient ischemic 
attack, and/or vascular stent placement.  Therefore, they encourage future research to determin e the 
safety of TXA in the high -risk patient.  
 
With the high volume of geriatr ic hip fractures treated at Lancaster General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (LGH),  we aim 
to obtain a large patient population to perform an ideal study. We would examine if administration of  
TXA prior to incision  in the geriatric hip fracture patient population decrease s the risk of intra -
operative or post -operative blood t ransfusions compared to placebo and determine the safety profile 
of such administration in high -risk patients.  
[ADDRESS_206156] s who are 
administered intravenous TXA prior to incision compared to those who receive a placebo.  
 
Data will be collected at Enrollm ent, Baseline, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3849], and  at Follow Up Visits at 2 (two) 
weeks, six (6) weeks and three (3) months  in conjunction with their standard of care post -operative 
visits.   In addition, all unscheduled visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], and d eaths will a lso be collected at  
[ADDRESS_206157] s are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TXA (interve ntion), or placebo ( control ). The 
randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_176343]:  
1. Hemiart hroplasty /total hip replacement  
2. Internal fixation with sliding hi p screw /cephalomedullary nail  
Each stratum will have its own list of random treatment assig nments to promote balance in the 
treatment groups with respect to the stratification factors . The treatment assignments will be 
computer -generated in blocks of varying sizes using REDCap.

The enrollment phase is projected to  take approximately 24 months .  
4.1 Total Number of Subjects and Sites  
The study enrollment is planned to be  400 subjects who me et eligibility criteria  and consent to the 
study .  The study will be conducted at only one (1) site, Lancaster General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
4.[ADDRESS_206162] be met are the following : 
1. Provision of  written informed consent  
2. Age ≥ 65 years  
3. Hip fracture location within the femoral neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric regions  
4. Indication for one of the following surgical interventions:  hemiarth roplasty, total hip replacement, 
sliding plate and screw fixation, or intramedullary fixation  
TAHFT   Page 8 
Version: 1.0 
 
 
 4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Patients will be excluded for  the following : 
1. Indication for  closed reduction or percutaneous screw  
2. Allergy to TXA 
3. Cerebrovascular accident/stroke, active coronary di sease/myocardial infarction, or deep vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary emboli within one (1) month of the fracture  
4. Presence of  hypercoagu lable disorder ,  includ ing cancer  (active disease) , elevated blood 
homocysteine levels, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and inherited protein deficiencies 
(antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, protein S & C deficiencies, prothrombin gene mutation)  
4.[ADDRESS_206163] Recruitment  
Given approximately 75% of the hip fractures in Lancaster County present at Lancaster General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176331] , ther e is not a need for marketing or advertising to 
recruit study subjects.  OAL’s volume of hip surgeries performed in calendar year [ADDRESS_206164] not analyzed this d rug 
TAHFT   Page 9 
Version: 1.0 
 
 
 administered to the high risk population, which  includes those with recent ischemic cardiac events 
(myocardial infarction s) or thromboembolic events (cerebrovascular accident and deep vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary emboli) , and patients with hypercoagu lable disorders. Because of the  
uncertainty whether  this drug increases the r isk of embolic events , we aim to eliminate patients with  
ischemic cardiac and  thromboembolic events within [ADDRESS_206165]’s name, MRN, and the designated surgical 
procedure (stratum).  REDCap generates the subject’s Study ID and then the stratified randomization 
assignment to TXA or placebo.  
 For subj ects randomized to the intervention arm, a pharmacy technician prepares a plain 100 cc 
normal saline bag with 10 cc of 100mg/cc TXA -saline (110 cc total) . For subjects randomized  to 
placebo, a plain 100 cc normal saline bag containing an additional 10 cc o f saline (110 cc total) will 
be used. A TAHFT study label with subject  MRN will be affixed to the plain [ADDRESS_206166] confirms the work of the pharmacy technician and confirms the REDCap randomization assignment and appropriate study drug/pl acebo saline bag preparation.  The saline 
solution and tranexamic acid will be used from the pharmacy available stock.   
 Upon approval, the pharmacist technician prepares the study treatment to be pi[INVESTIGATOR_176332]. Anesthesia confirms study subject  identity, and blinded 
study drug is administered prior to surgical incision.   
 
5.[ADDRESS_206167] s will not be blinded to  treatment  assignment . The operating  room 
staff, surgeon , anesthesiology, research coordinator, and research assistant will be blinded  for the 
duration of the study, as will the subjects themselves.

 6.4 Unscheduled Visits  
It is anticipated that < 5% of subjects require an additional unscheduled visit.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_176336].  Any relevant information from these visits will be captured by 
[CONTACT_176346] 6 weeks and 3 month.  
7 Statistical Plan  
Statistica l support will be provided by [CONTACT_176347].  
7.1 Sample Size and Power Determination  
Power calculations are based on the assumptions that 20% of the control group will require 
transfusion as a result of the hip fracture and surgery, and that use of TXA will reduce that 
percentage by [CONTACT_176348] 10% . For 80% power with a two -sided alpha of 0.05,  and using a likelihood 
ratio test,  the sample size is calculated to be 200 per group with a 1:1 assignment ratio, or 400 total  
subjects.  
7.2 Statistic al Methods  
For assessing the primary endpoint, we will calculate an odds ratio (with a 95% confidence interval) 
for transfusion with p -values calculated using a likelihood ratio.  
 
As a secondary outcome, daily hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will be asse ssed using a mixed -
effects linear model with adjustment for appropriate covariates. Safety/complication outcomes such 
as 30- day readmissions, embolic events or other complications will be assessed using appropriate 
binary or Poisson models. Descriptive sta tistics using appropriate comparative models will be used to 
assess homogeneity of demographics and any differences in outcomes between the control and 
intervention groups.  
 
One interim analysis is planned to assess the primary endpoint for significant eff icacy sufficient to 
stop the trial early. The interim analysis is planned for the ¾ point of the trial or a minimum of 300 
subjects enrolled . To compensate for one interim and one final analysis, we will employ the O’Brien -
Fleming adjustments to significan ce level criteria with p < 0.0054 for the interim analysis and p < 
0.0492 for the final analysis.  Based upon a simulation of our primary outcome, futility will be reached 
at the interim analysis point if the control group has a 30 (30/150 = 20%) or fewer s ubjects that 
have experienced a transfusion and the intervention group has 26 (26/150 = 17.3%) or more subjects that have experienced a transfusion . Even if the remaining 50 intervention subjects to be 
enrolled experience no transfusions and the transfusio n rate remains at 20% in the control group, H
0 
will not be rejected.

8 Safety and Event  Reporting  
The study will comply with requirements of the  Lancaster General Human Research Protection 
Program  (HRPP) policies regarding reporting of  unanticipated problems and adverse events.   
8.[ADDRESS_206173] of potential 
adverse events . 
 
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that 
are still ongoing at the end of th e study period will be followed up t o determine the final outcome.  
8.2 Relationship of AE to Study  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_176337], in his judgment, the relationship of each adverse event to the study 
procedures should be characterized. The relationship will be classif ied as probably related, possibly 
related,  or unlikely to be related . 
8.3 Reporting of  Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated  problems , as defined by [CONTACT_176349],  will be reported to the IRB in accordance with 
the same policy. All other adverse events , withdrawals,  and study deviations will be reported in 
summary form during the continuing IRB review of the study or in the final report.

9.1 Data base and Data Management  
The study database will be designed and main tained in REDCap , a HIPAA compliant database (Harris  
et al). Study staff will be granted access to database sections based upon role. Only the pharmacists 
responsible for randomization will have access to the un -blinded study group assignment  assigned by 
[CONTACT_176350] . Research staff will have access to enter data but not extract summary 
data. Clinical personnel will not have any access to the study database to maintain equipoise and 
independence. Subject identifiers will be maintained in the database to facilitate the conduct of the 
study and insure accurate data collection. Upon completion of the study, the database will be locked 
and subject identifiers will be secured and not connected with the study data. Study data will be 
maintained in REDCap after completion of the study in archive mode.  
 
The study screening log of patients who are not enrolled in the study will also be maintained in 
REDCap. The log will not contai n any personal identifiers for these patients.  
9.2 Records Retention  
Study reco rds will be retained for a minimum of 6 years, in accordance with HRPP policy.  
10 Study Monitoring  
10.1 Quality Assurance Monitoring  
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_176338]. 
However, as an investigator -initiated study without an external monitor that conducts monitoring, the 
TAHFT study will be prioritized for monitoring by [CONTACT_176351] . Compliance with HRPP policies will be assessed, consent forms will be reviewed, and IRB 
correspondence and any other regulatory documentation will be checked. Study data may be sampled to be checked for accuracy.  
 
Should any concerns about non -compliance emerge, HRPP policy for review and investigation will be 
followed.
  
10.2 Data and Safety  Monitoring 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for TAHFT comprises four individuals who work 
at LGH. Because the drug is an approved drug and there is significant experience with its use, it is 
believed that an internal committee can adequatel y monitor the trial.  The committee will include a 
trauma surgeon,  anesthesiologist, orthopedic surgeon, and orthopedic nurse , as well as a 
biostatistician. In addition, the principal investigator, Gregory Tocks, DO, will attend  committee 
meetings to addres s protocol. As the principal investigator , he is the person most familiar with the 
drug protocol and in the b est position to address questions  about it . However, he  will not participate 
in any votes about study continuation or termination . 
 
The first meeting of the committee will take place once the [ADDRESS_206175]. Thereafter, t he committee will meet biannually to review 
accumulated safety data and as hoc as needed to review or address any adverse ev ents. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_176339].  Specific safety outcomes to be 
monitored include:  
• Rate of 30 day readmissions and rea son 
• Complications within 90 days from surgery  
• Other unanticipated events  
 
TAHFT   Page 15

 One interim analysis will be conducted when 75% of enrollment is achieved to determine if the study 
should stop early for efficacy or futility. It also will allow assessment of the benefits concordantly with 
the risks.  
[ADDRESS_206176] (IRB). 
Any changes to the protocol or consent form that represent potential changes to the risk -benefit ratio 
or an increase in what is required of subjects will be submitted to the IRB as an amendment for 
review before it is implemented (unless a delay in implementation would compromise subject safety).

authorized representative, following LG policies. The subject will be informed about the trial to the 
extent compatible with the subject’s capacity for understanding.  If the legally authorized 
representative is not available in person, the consenting physician may transmit the consent form to 
the representative electronically and discuss the study with the representative by [CONTACT_648]. The legally 
authorized representative may return a signed copy by [CONTACT_176352]. Alternatively, electronic signature [CONTACT_176353].  
 
For use s of a short form, an alteration of the HIPAA authorization requirement is requested. That is, 
in these circumstances, authorization to use and discl ose health information will be obtained orally , 
but no signature [CONTACT_176354] .

medical  care.   
 
Unless a subjec t withdraws soon after consent and before surgery, it is likely that the study 
intervention will be completed. That is, when a subject  withdraws from the study after surgery, s/he 
is withdrawing only from follow -up data collection from the medical record.  
 
Some subject s or legally authorized representatives may wish to withdraw medical care. An OAL 
physician will review  with them the standardized routine hip fracture follow up care for [ADDRESS_206179] already been collected up until study withdrawal will remain part of the 
TAHFT study database.  
11.4 Privacy and Confidentiality  
Patients will be approached about participating in t he study in the emergency room, patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176340], or the pre -operative room. They will be extended as much privacy as possible, with 
conversations about the study occurring in the context of therapeutic decision -making. All follow -up 
interactions with  participants also will occur in the context of medical care.  
 The use of subjects’ medical data for research purposes will be explained in the consent and authorization process. T he study database will contain the participant s’ name s and  medical record 
numbers to facilitate the conduct of the study . The study database will be accessible only to study 
personnel, as described in Section 9.1.  
 Identifiable data will not be disclosed outside of LG Health. However, subjects will be informed that 
their study dat a could be de -identified and shared with other researchers.  
 
Data on hip fracture patients who do not participate in the TAHFT study will be recorded in a de -
identified manner, to allow assessment of the generalizability of the patient population and study  
results.

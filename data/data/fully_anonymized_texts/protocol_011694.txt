 These associations may be statistically tested 
using correlation coefficients and general linear 
models, if appropriate.  
 
 
STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  Details of all planned analyses will be specified in  a 
separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be 
finalized prior to hard -lock of the study database.  
The SAP will contain details of all the analyses 
including specifications for all tables, listings and 
figures. All statistical programming will be 
performed using SAS software.  
Estimated Sample Size:  
No clinical trial data are available on the CDM1 -RS 
instrument. Twenty -five subjects per group will 
generate 70% power to detect the effect size of 0.6 
at the 0.1 two -sided significance level. This sample 
size will also be sufficient to generate 80% power to 
detect the effect size of 0.82 at the 0.05 two -sided 
significance level. Accounting for a 10% -13% drop- 
out rate, approximately 28 subjects per group will be 
enrolled. A blinded sample size re -estimation 
(SSRE), based on the observed variance in the 
primary outcome measure, was performed once 33% 
of subjects had been enrolled and had completed 
. The effect size assumptions were partially 
based on the Clinician VAS (  
 total score changes from baseline 
to end of study ([ADDRESS_788781] deviation of 5.8). 
Based on these and other data, 29 and 22 subjects 
per group will be sufficient to generate 90% and 
80% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_788782]: Tideglusib  CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol No: AMO -02-MD-2-003

0.05 two sided significance level. However, the 
variability of the key secondary endpoint was 
slightly greater than that originally assumed. 
Respectively, it was recommended, if operationally 
feasible, to increase the total sample size to a 
maximum of 66 subjects.  
Statistical Methods for Safety : 
Analysis of safety will be performed based on the 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS). See section 11.2 for 
definition.  All AEs will be coded  using  the MedDRA 
dictionary and will be summarized by  [CONTACT_3148].  
Other safety data, including laboratory, vital signs 
and ECG values including change from baseline will 
be summarized.  
Statistical Methods for Efficacy:  
Primary and key secondary analyses of efficacy will 
be based on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population. 
Other efficacy analyses will be performed based on 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS). See section 11.[ADDRESS_788784]: Tideglusib  CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol No: AMO -02-MD-2-003

 from baseline over time may also be assessed using 
the linear mixed effects repeated measures model.  
Due to COVID -19 related restrictions some of the 
data at certain visits may be collected using a 
telehealth approach while other data may be 
collected during in -clinic visits. To evaluate the 
consistency of telehealth data and in -clinic data for 
the CDM1 -RS and CGI rating scales and to 
minimize the potential bias, Baseline ( , Week  
( ) and Week ) visits will be performed 
using both in -clinic and telehealth data collection 
approaches. Analysis to evaluate the consistency of 
these two methods of data collection will be 
performed.  
According to the recommendations in the FDA 
Guidance “Statistical Considerations for Clinical 
Trials During the COVID -19 Public Health 
Emergency”, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
in addition to the primary analysis (FDA, 2020). The 
sensitivity analyses will include combined use of 
telehealth and in -clinic data; the impact of using 
telehealth data on outcomes will be evaluated.  
The exploratory endpoint analysis will be outlined in 
the SAP. The details of the analysis methods will be 
determined after exploratory endpoint data review.

5. BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
5.1 Myotonic  dystrophy  
Myotonic dystrophy is a monogenetic disorder caused by  [CONTACT_105]-coding expansion repeats in 
the DMPK  gene  (myotonic  dystrophy  type 1 or adult  onset  DM1  or Steinert  disease),  which 
is located on chromosome 19, or the CNBP gene (myotonic dystrophy type 2 or DM2), 
which is located on chromosome 3. There are no symptomatic or disease -modifying 
treatments approved for the treatment of individuals with myotonic  dystrophy.  
DM1 may be present at birth (Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy), appear during childhood 
(Childhood Myotonic Dystrophy) or during adulthood (Classic Adult onset Myotonic 
Dystrophy and Late onset Myotonic Dystrophy).  
Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy (Congenital DM1) is a life threatening disorder, with a 
mortality rate of 25 percent by [CONTACT_654] 1.5 years and 50 percent by [CONTACT_654] 30 years (Reardon et 
al., 1993). This study reported that 50 percent of subjects were unable to walk unaided 
with 4 percent of subjects requiring wheelchairs. Less than a quarter of Congenital DM1 
patients were able to attend mainstream schooling due to intellectual disability, 15  percent 
were still fecally incontinent at 5 years of age and in patients who lived  to 20 years of age, 
79 percent were unemployed. Complementary data were reported by [CONTACT_597139]öm et al., 
(2009), who noted learning disabilities in 95 and 89 percent of Congenital and Childhood 
DM1 patients, respectively. Ekström et al., (2008) also reported that 68 percent and 50 
percent, respectively, of individuals with Congenital and Childhood DM1 had an Autism 
Spectrum Disorder  (ASD).  
Current practice distinguishes between congenital, infantile, juvenile, adult, and late onset 
forms (Dogan et al., 2016) of DM1. The condition is a multi -system disorder that affects 
muscle, brain, the heart, and liver amongst other organs. When DM1 has an onset in early 
adulthood, presentation is primarily characterized by a progressive distal weakness of the 
hands  and arms,  myotonia  and excessive  daytime  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  (Heatwole  et al., 2012).  Adult 
onset  DM1  is associated  with increased  mortality,  with mean  survival  age reported  to be in 
the range of 55.4 years (Mathieu et al., 1999) to 60 years (de Die -Smulders et al.,  1998).  
Congenital DM1 is distinct from all other forms of DM1 in both time of onset, severity of 
disease, and genetic presentation.  
• The expansion repeat size in individuals with Congenital DM1 is typi[INVESTIGATOR_597108] - or adult onset forms of DM1 
(Ekström et al.,  2008).  
• The congenital onset form of DM1 is by [CONTACT_597140]1 with onset at 
other ages (Genevieve et al., 2015).

• In particular, the CNS features of Congenital DM1 are much more severe than 
juvenile or adult onset forms. Almost all individuals with Congenital DM1 have 
intellectual disability, which is not the case with juvenile DM1 (Ekström et al., 
2008).  
• Also, characteristic neuromuscular and skeletomuscular features, described below, 
are evident at birth in Congenital  DM1.  
• Congenital DM1 can be distinguished at the molecular and histological level. 
Congenital  DM1  is associated  with RNA  splicing  variants  that are not present  in the 
adult onset form (Thomas et al., 2017). The presentation of muscle cell types in 
Congenital DM1 is different to that in juvenile and adult onset DM1 (Nakamori et 
al., 2017).  
Congenital DM1 may be a disorder in which muscle fibers fail to develop at the 
microscopic level, being therefore a developmental disorder. Adult onset DM1 can be 
considered  a degenerative  disorder  of muscle,  whose  histopathological  features  may appear 
in adulthood  in Congenital  DM1.  The genomic  lesions  in Congenital  DM1  and Adult -onset 
DM1 may differ in respect somatic  instability.  
The hallmark clinical stigmata of neonates with Congenital DM1 include hypotonia, 
generalized weakness, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], feeding difficulties, and clubfoot or 
another musculoskeletal deformity. As infancy and young childhood progress, Congenital 
DM1 is associated with pronounced and unremitting oral facial weakness including 
diminished lip strength, respi[INVESTIGATOR_046], characteristic facies, often profound 
intellectual disability and behavioral disorders akin to ASD (Johnson et al., 2016).  These 
features are not central to Adult -onset DM1 which is associated with signs and symptoms 
that arise  later in life, and in which  fatigue,  daytime  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_597109].  
As described previously, Congenital DM1 is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality; life expectancy is significantly shortened with 25 percent of affected patients 
deceased by 18 months and less than 50 percent surviving to 30 years of age. Life - 
expectancy may be decreased in Adult -onset DM1 but to a lesser degree.  
 
 
5.2 Tideglusib  
Tideglusib (4 -benzyl -2-naphtalen -1-yl-1,2,4 -thiadiazolidine -3,5-dione) is a new chemical 
entity (NCE) from the thiadiazolidindiones chemical family. It is an irreversible inhibitor 
of Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta ([COMPANY_004] -3 β). 
Tideglusib is a brain penetrant and can be orally administered. The IMP is ‘tideglusib for 
oral suspension’. It

[COMPANY_004] -3 is a serine/threonine  protein  kinase  enzyme  that recently  emerged  as a key target  in 
drug discovery. [COMPANY_004] -3 has two isoforms – [COMPANY_004] -3α and [COMPANY_004] -3β. [COMPANY_004] -3β is implicated 
in neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders. [COMPANY_004] -3β is highly expressed in 
muscle cells as well as in brain cells (Woodgett, 1990), is important in central nervous 
system (CNS) ontology (Beurel et al. , 2012) and is a key signaling element in activity 
dependent synaptic plasticity (Rui et al.,  2013).  
Signaling downstream of the insulin receptor is disrupted in DM1, given the significant 
splicing mis -regulation of the insulin receptor itself. Prior therapeutic trials (Heatwole, et 
al., 2011) have focused on upregulating the insulin signal itself. The current approach 
targets the disrupted signaling downstream of the insulin receptor, at the [COMPANY_004] -3β site.  
Jones et al ., reported in [ADDRESS_788806] containing the 
DMPK gene CUG repeat formed as a hairpin. Administration of tideglusib is also 
associated  with fragmentation  of the mutant  DMPK  gene  RNA  in Congenital  DM1  patient 
tissue and reduction of DMPK gene RNA foci in muscle from the HSALR mouse (Wang  et 
al 2019). Further, tideglusib reverses deficits in myodifferentiation of Congenital DM1 
myoblasts in vitro . Tideglusib also significantly attenuates abnormalities in total levels 
and splice variants of key effectors such as BIN1 and SERCA1 in Congenital DM1 tissue 
in vitro  and the HSALR transgenic  mouse  model  of DM1  (

inhibition of [COMPANY_004] -3 could have the potential to reverse myotonia and improve muscle 
weakness in patients with Congenital DM1. Similarly, there is affirming preclinical 
evidence from neurodevelopmental models that suggest that tideglusib may have the 
potential to improve the associated neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms 
associated with DM1. This will be the first randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study of a [COMPANY_004] -3 inhibitor in children and adolescents with Congenital DM1. The 
following factors are taken into account:  
 
Dose:  
The dose of tideglusib that will be utilized in this study is within the dose range, and the 
weight -adjustment dosing strategy, that was implemented in the aforementioned  Canadian 
TIDE study in children and adolescents with ASD. The doses for the TIDE study and for 
this study were selected based upon preclinical efficacy pharmacology studies as well as 
the safety data from prior clinical  studies.

In the recently completed AMO -02-MD-2-001 study, the study drug was well tolerated 
with all 16 subjects enrolled completing the study, and no early discontinuations or dose 
adjustments required. There were no SAEs or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) reported during the study and no serious AEs related to drug. There 
were no systematic irregularities in objective assessments (e.g. vital signs, ECGs,

Based on data from a natural history study of this population and in consideration of the 
type of improvements anticipated to be measured, a duration of weeks of treatment  has 
been selected to investigate the effects of tideglusib on existing signs and symptoms. The 
effects  of tideglusib  and analogues  on transgenic  mouse  models  of myotonic  dystrophy  and 
on abnormal  differentiation  of Congenital  DM1  muscle  tissue  in vitro  revealed  rapid  onset 
following acute dosing. The time course over which tideglusib or any other 
pharmacological agent may demonstrate efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of 
Congenital DM1 has not yet been  established.

In the event a combined telehealth and home healthcare visit is required, or unscheduled 
visits as outlined in section 9.5, the following endpoints and procedures may be impacted, 
as follows:  
• Clinician completed assessments (i.e. CDM1 -RS, CGI -I, CGI -S, Vineland 
Adaptive Behavior Scale and ABI -C) will be completed via  telehealth  
• Caregiver -completed  assessments  (i.e. Top 3 Caregiver  Concerns  VAS,  CC-MDHI 
and CC -CDM1 -RS) will be completed remotely in the subject’s  home  
• 10-meter walk -run test: will not be collected as it is unable to be completed safely 
in a subject’s  home  
• Lip strength assessment will not be able to be completed as specialized 
physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_597111]  
• Grip strength assessment will not be able to be completed as specialized

• NIH toolbox assessments (i.e. Dimensional Change Card Sort Test and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_597112])  and the Peabody  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_595604] (PPVT)  will not 
be completed as telehealth administration is non -standard administration for these 
tests. Sensitivity analyses on the primary, key secondary and one secondary 
endpoint to support telehealth administration are intended to be performed, and 
therefore additional sensitivity analyses for these exploratory tests will not be 
performed.  
• DXA scan: will need to be completed locally or may be unable to be  completed  
samples will be unable to be processed outside of a clinical 
laboratory, and therefore will not be collected  
• Physical  examinations  will not be able to be completed  outside  of the clinic  setting. 
If a subject  is unable  to complete  Week  in-clinic,  a physical  exam  will be 
completed  locally.  
• Vital signs, height and weight will be collected remotely in the subject’s home 
using an AMO approved home healthcare  vendor  
• Safety  laboratory  and urinalysis  samples  will be collected  remotely  in the subject’s 
home using an AMO approved home healthcare  vendor

review; that Charter will include a description of the Committee, the Members and their 
responsibilities,  timing  of the reviews,  and considerations  for any statistical  items  (e.g. data 
displays) that may be required for the data  reviews.  
The DSMC will meet quarterly to review safety and tolerability data for the total study 
population. The DSMC review will be unblinded. The DSMC will make a 
recommendation to either proceed with the protocol with no modification or may suggest 
changes to the protocol. Based on the results of their data reviews, the DSMC will submit 
its recommendations in written form to the Sponsor who is responsible for responding to 
the recommendations of the DSMC and to take appropriate action.

• Communication  difficulties  
• Impaired sleep or daytime  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• Difficulty  thinking  
• Myotonia  
• Breathing  difficulties  
• Choking or swallowing  issues  
This list of domains is informed by [CONTACT_597153] (CC -MDHI) (Johnson et al., 2016). The CC -MDHI is a rating scale 
developed from a Natural History Study of the symptoms and impact of Congenital DM1 
(Johnson et al., 2016). The CC -MDHI is a [ADDRESS_788843]. The CDM1 -RS is being developed in collaboration with the 
authors of the CC -MDHI. This new outcome measure utilizes domains informed by [CONTACT_597154] -MDHI; the scale covers much of the breadth of the clinical  phenotype 
of Congenital  DM1.  
The severity of the clinician’s concern in each domain is scored by [CONTACT_2329] a 5 point Likert 
Scale. Scores range from 0 = Not present to 4 = Very severe. The clinician is asked to  rate 
the severity  of each symptom,  using  a time frame  of the past week  including  the day of the 
assessment for  reference.  
A standard interview and examination form will be provided to the sites to assist the rater 
making  assessments  and in eliciting  commentary  from  the subject  or their caregiver  across 
each of the core domains of the affected individual’s Congenital DM1, and also on 
associated  symptoms.  Every  effort  will be made  to ensure  that the same  rater also observes 
the subject at each visit to the clinic or telehealth  visit.  
At Baseline ( ), Week ) and Week ) the CDM1 -RS will be rated twice for 
consistency evaluation purposes. One rating will be from an interview completed  in-clinic 
and an another  from  an interview  completed  via telehealth  within  the  period  before 
the in -clinic visit. Both the in -clinic and telehealth interviews will be video  recorded.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Global Impressions (Severity and  Improvement)  
The clinician administered Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S) and - 
Improvement  (CGI -I) scale  (Guy,  1976)  will be performed  in accordance  with the schedule 
of events. The CGI rating scale permits a global evaluation of the subject’s improvement 
over time and will be administered as detailed in the schedule of events.  
The CGI -S is a [ADDRESS_788844]’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience 
with subjects  who have  the same  diagnosis.  Considering  total clinical  experience,  a subject 
is assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline 
ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely  ill. 
The CGI -I, sometimes referred to as the CGI -C, requires the clinician to rate how much 
the subject’s illness has changed (improved, worsened or stayed the same) relative to a 
baseline state (Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc, 2000). A seven point Likert type scale is used 
with ratings of 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4  
= no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse.  
The CGI-I at Baseline  ) should  be rated  against  the subject’s  clinical  presentation  at 
Run-in  ). For subsequent  CGI -I ratings  completed  from    onwards,  the 
assessment  should  be compared  against  the subject’s  clinical  presentation  at Baseline  ( .  
In this study, score levels for the CGI -S and CGI -I are calibrated to standard scoring 
anchors which are specific to the Congenital DM1 phenotype. A standard interview and 
examination form will be provided to the sites as a guide to the rater in evaluating the 
subject and in eliciting commentary from the subject or their caregiver across each of the 
core domains of the affected individual’s Congenital DM1 and also on associated 
symptoms. Every effort will be made to have the same rater also observe the subject at 
each visit to the clinic or telehealth visit.

Caregivers will be asked to rate three causes for concern by [CONTACT_740] a vertical mark on a 
10 cm long VAS  with anchors  of “not at all severe”  at the left end and “very  severe”  at the 
right end. Ideally, the caregiver should choose one item that relates to muscle function 
(such as problems with walking, drinking from a straw, or grip), one item that relates to 
cognitive abilities (such as problems with thinking, planning or concentration), and one 
item that relates to performing activities of daily living (for example, problems or 
difficulties brushing teeth, getting dressed or helpi[INVESTIGATOR_597116]). The [ADDRESS_788848]’s myotonic dystrophy will be chosen and rated at baseline.

individuals with CDM1. There are a total of 11 symptoms that the caregiver is asked to 
rate: 
 
• Limitations with mobility or  walking  
• Problems with hands or  arms  
• Signs of  fatigue

• Breathing  difficulties  
• Choking or swallowing  issues  
 
These  symptoms  are rated  on a score  from  0 to 4 based  on overall  severity  (e.g. severity  of 
symptoms, frequency of symptoms, context in which it occurs and functional impact), 
where  0 = Symptom  not present  or is no longer  present  during  the relevant  time frame,  and 
4 = Very severe, symptom causes pronounced and consistent impairment and is highly 
disruptive with regard to daily  life. 
When rating each symptom, the caregiver will be asked to consider how the symptom 
influences how the subject feels and how it impacts his/her ability to perform everyday 
functions. Caregivers ratings should also incorporate important observations that they 
make of the subject, with regard to his/her symptoms. For example, caregivers should 
consider the subject's behaviors and verbalizations (what he/she says), as well as the 
symptoms that the caregiver can actually see. When making their ratings, the caregiver is 
asked to consider a time frame of the past week including the day of the assessment for 
reference.  
The CC -CDM1 -RS will be administered according to the schedule of events and will be 
completed remotely in the subject’s home if required due to a COVID -19 related reason.

allowed, forearm crutches or walkers are not allowed. Use of assistive devices must be 
documented and kept consistent for that subject throughout the  study.  
For the fastest speed possible, the assessor will document whether the subject was able to 
run, walk fast or walk for each assessment. Whether the subject is running is defined as 
both feet being off the floor at the same time. If the subject is not able/willing to perform 
the fastest speed possible for all 3 valid assessments, this will also be recorded.  
The 10-meter  walk/run  will not be collected  remotely  (i.e. if an in-clinic  visit is not possible 
due to a COVID -19 related reason) as it is unable to be completed safely in a home 
environment.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Quantitative myometric measure of hand grip  strength  
Handgrip myometry is used as a measure of myotonia and muscle strength and has been 
validated as a reliable measure in patients with DM1 (Moxley et al., 2007).  
The force of concentration will be measured using the Jamar Handgrip Dynamometer and 
will be measured in kilograms (Kg).  
Handgrip strength will be tested bilaterally, first on the right and then followed by [CONTACT_597155]. The subject will be asked to squeeze the Jamar Handgrip dynamometer for [ADDRESS_788851] given  between  trials

Population pharmacokinetic modelling will be used to analyze the data. If PK parameters 
cannot  be estimated  using  the study  data only,  prior  information  on parameter  distributions 
from a previously reported pharmacokinetic model of tideglusib will be used. In order to 
determine whether there are associations between pharmacokinetic parameters and 
efficacy measures, change from baseline in efficacy measures over the course of the  study 
may be correlated with model -predicted PK parameters estimated for each subject. These 
associations may be statistically tested using correlation coefficients and general linear 
models, if  appropriate.

of general,  non-leading  questioning.  All adverse  events  should  be recorded  in the CRF and 
source  document.  
 
10.5.1  Definitions 
Adverse Event  (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
Abnormal laboratory findings should be reviewed by a delegated physician to determine 
whether they are clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratories should 
be reported as an AE. Where possible an underlying diagnosis should be reported as the 
AE. 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
All events considered to be untoward and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related  to any dose should  be considered  adverse  drug reactions.  The definition  covers  also 
medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and 
abuse of the product. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled  out. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event that at any  dose:  
• Results in  death  Instructions for th

• Is life -threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  (see 
explanation  below)  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Is considered to be an important medical event  
 
Based upon medical and scientific judgment, important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening, or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above may be considered a serious adverse event.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597128]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597129],  practical  or social  reasons, 
in the absence of an adverse event is not an  SAE.  
 
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. However, any pregnancy complication, 
spontaneous or elective abortion (for medical reasons), still birth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly will be recorded in both the clinical and safety database.  
If the investigator  becomes  aware  of a pregnancy  in a female  subject,  or in a female  partner 
of a male subject in this study, every effort will be made to follow the pregnancy until 
termination or  delivery.  
In the event of pregnancy (either in a female subject or a female partner of a male subject 
in the study), it will be reported on a pregnancy form, and reported as per the information 
in section 10.5.8.  This report will be followed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects or congenital abnormalities. The outcome will be documented in the CRF if 
feasible. In the case of a female subject, the subject must be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with applicable 
product information (e.g., Investigators Brochure for an unapproved IMP).

Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence, or 
severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected 
events.  
 
 
10.5.2  Severity  Categorization  
The severity (intensity) of each AE will be classified as:  
• Mild  (Grade  1) Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated; no 
interference with activity  
• Moderate  (Grade  2) Sign or symptom causes discomfort, some interference with 
activity  
• Severe  (Grade 3)  Sign or symptom of sufficient intensity to prevent  activity

10.5.5  Symptoms of Disease Under  Study  
Symptoms of the disease under study (e.g. problems with ambulation, fine motor 
difficulties, fatigue, speech difficulties, and gastrointestinal issues) present before study 
entry should be recorded in the CRF. These symptoms should not be classed as AEs as 
long as changes are within the normal day to day fluctuation or expected progression of 
the disease; however, significant worsening of the symptoms, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], should be recorded as an AE.  
 
 
10.5.6  Clinical Laboratory  Evaluations  
Abnormal  laboratory  findings  (e.g. ) or 
other abnormal assessments (e.g. ECGs, vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_597161], 
as defined in Section 10.5.1 . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that  are

All SAE’s and AEs occurring after informed consent and on or before the final visit must 
be reported. All AEs must be recorded irrespective of whether they are considered drug 
related.  
At each visit/assessment in the period defined above, AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_597167].  
Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing,  should 
be reviewed at subsequent visits. If these have resolved, this should be  documented.  
 
 
11. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) which will be finalized prior to hard -lock of the study database. The SAP will 
contain  details  of all the analyses  including  specifications  for all tables,  listings  and figures. 
All statistical programming will be performed using SAS  software.  
A blinded  sample  size re-estimation  (SSRE),  based  on the observed  variance  in the primary 
outcome measure, will occur when approximately 33% of subjects are enrolled and have 
completed   The variability  of key secondary  and secondary  endpoints  may 
be assessed as well, if feasible. This SSRE was executed as planned.  
Primary  and key secondary  analyses  of efficacy  will be based  on the Intent  To Treat  (ITT) 
population and the summary of safety based upon the Safety Analysis Set (see definitions 
below in sec tion 11.2 ). Other efficacy analyses will be based on the Full Analysis  Set. 
Statistical significance will be assessed at the 0.05 two -sided level, unless specified 
otherwise.  
In general, statistical analyses will be performed using methods which account for known 
potential confounding data (e.g. sites/geographic locations, baseline characteristics, 
 
Changes in efficacy variables from Baseline  to post -treatment visits (or observed 
values for some variables such as CGI -I) will be summarized and compared between the 
weight adjusted tideglusib 1000 mg dose and placebo at each study visit. The primary 
comparison will be performed for changes from baseline to end of treatment. The model 
details and data displays will be described in the SAP.  
Additionally, the changes from baseline over time will be compared using linear mixed 
effects repeated measures modelling.  
For all analyses,  the effects  of the weight  adjusted  tideglusib  1000  mg dose versus  placebo 
will be estimated at the end of treatment and presented along with associated 95% two - 
sided confidence intervals and p -values. The comparisons may also be performed at  other

time points; however the p -values should be reviewed with caution due to potential 
multiplicity issue (high probability of chance -alone outcomes).  
Subjects  and who discontinue 
the study will be classified as screening failures. Subjects  
 but who discontinue the study before taking a dose of tideglusib will be classified 
as run -in failures.  
 
 
11.1 Estimated Sample  Size 
 
One of the study goals is to identify consistent efficacy trends in the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. Twenty -five subjects per group will generate 70% power to detect 
the effect size of 0.6 at the 0.1 two -sided significance level. This sample size will also be 
sufficient to generate 80% power to detect the effect size of 0.82 at the 0.05 two -sided 
significance level. Accounting for a 10% -13% drop -out rate, approximately [ADDRESS_788874]  size assumptions  are partially  based  on the Clinician  VAS  total 
score changes from baseline to end of study ([ADDRESS_788875] deviation of 5.8). Based on these and other data, 29 and 22 subjects 
per group will be sufficient to generate 90% and 80% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_788876] 80% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_788877] treatment differences will be 82% if 
n=25/group.  
 
 
The details of the SSRE and summary of scenarios and outcomes are outlined in the SAP.

11.2 Study  Populations  
 
Assignment of subjects to analysis populations will be agreed prior to database lock and 
unblinding.  
 
The Intent  to Treat  Set (ITT)  will include  all randomized  subjects.  Subjects  will be included 
in the analysis  set according  to their randomized  treatment  assignment  regardless  of actual 
treatment received. The ITT is the primary population for the analysis of efficacy  data.  
 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) will include all randomised subjects who took at least one 
dose of IMP. The SAF will be used for all summaries of safety data.  
 
The Full Analysis  Set (FAS)  will include  all randomised  subjects  in the SAF for whom  any 
efficacy data were collected post randomisation. Subjects will be included in the analysis 
set according to the treatment they actually  received.  
 
The Per Protocol  Set (PPS)  will include  all subjects  in the FAS who did not have  any major 
protocol violations. Definitions of major and minor protocol violations will be included  in 
the SAP prior to data lock and unblinding. Subjects excluded from the PPS will be 
determined  prior  to data unblinding.  If no subjects  are excluded  from  the PPS,  the PPS will 
not be required. The PPS will be used for secondary analyses of efficacy  data.  
 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) will consist of all subjects for whom PK 
samples that were taken were analyzable and for whom the corresponding dosing 
information prior to sample collection and sample collection information is available. 
Listings of study data will be based on all subjects who were randomised into the study.  
 
 
11.3 Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics (including medical history, 
Congenital  DM1  history,  prior  treatments)  will be provided  by [CONTACT_597168].

11.5 Statistical Methods for  Efficacy  
Primary analysis of efficacy will be based on the ITT population. Additional analysis will 
be performed based on FAS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (CDM1 -RS) will be calculated at each time point as a total 
score  based  on [ADDRESS_788879] -treatment visits will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (weight 
adjusted  tideglusib  1000  mg versus  Placebo)  at each study  visit.  For the CGI-I the observed 
values will be  summarized.  
Change  from  baseline  to end of treatment  will be analysed  using  general  linear  model  with 
terms for treatment group, baseline and treatment group by [CONTACT_420780] (observed 
values  will be analysed  for the CGI-I).  
 
The statistical significance of changes from baseline over time may also be assessed  using 
the linear mixed effects repeated measures model with fixed effect terms for treatment 
group, follow -up visit and treatment group by [CONTACT_6492] -up visit interaction. Subject will be 
included as a random effect and baseline as a covariate.  
 If covariates/interactions in any model are 
not statistically significant at the 0.05/0.1 two -sided levels, respectively, they will be 
excluded from the model. The details will be specified in the  SAP.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint for analysis is:  
• CGI-I at the end of  treatment  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for analysis are:  
• The change from baseline in the Top 3 Caregiver Concerns VAS total score to end of 
treatment  
• The change from baseline in the CC -CDM1 -RS total score to end of  treatment

• The change from baseline in CGI -S to end of  treatment  
• The change from baseline in the CDM1 -RS independent central rater total score  to end

• The change from baseline in CGI -S independent central rater score to end of  treatment  
• CGI-I independent central rater score at the end of  treatment  
• The change  from  baseline  in 10 Meter  Walk/Run  (preferred  speed  and fastest  speed)  to 
end of  treatment  
 
Due to COVID -19 related restrictions some of the data at certain visits may be collected 
using a telehealth approach while other data may be collected during in -clinic visits. To 
evaluate the consistency of telehealth data and in -clinic data for the CDM1 -RS and CGI 
rating  scales  and to minimize  the potential  bias, Baseline  ), Week  ( )  and Week   
) visits will be performed using both in -clinic and telehealth data collection 
approaches. The following analysis will be performed to evaluate the consistency of these 
two methods of data collection. The details of these and some other consistency analyses 
will be specified in the  SAP.  
• Telehealth data will be plotted against corresponding in -clinic data for visual 
evaluation; the changes from baseline to various time points based on the 
corresponding telehealth and in -clinic data will also be  plotted.  
• The various descriptive statistics for the difference between corresponding telehealth 
and in -clinic data will be evaluated; the changes from baseline for the corresponding 
telehealth and in -clinic data will be evaluated using various descriptive statistics and 
correlation  analysis.  
According to the recommendations in the FDA Guidance “Statistical Considerations for 
Clinical Trials During the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” the following sensitivity 
analyses will be performed in addition to the primary analysis performed (FDA,  2020).  
• If the data is missing due to a subject’s inability to attend clinic due to COVID -19 
related reasons, the corresponding telehealth data will be utilized, where applicable; 
the primary and key secondary analyses will then be  performed.  
• If the dataset includes both in -clinic and telehealth data, the analysis stratified by [CONTACT_597169]. Alternatively, the indicator variable with 
the values corresponding to the data acquisition approaches may be utilized in the 
model to determine the significance of the data acquisition impact on  outcomes.  
• The missing data will be imputed using one of the imputation approaches described

APPENDIX B: Clinical Global Impressions (Severity and Improvement)  
 
CGI -S and CGI -I 
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI -S) and Clinical Global 
Impression – Improvement of Illness (CGI -I) are brief, easy to administer, clinician -rated 
measures (Guy, 1976). The CGI -S asks the clinician to rate the patient’s current severity 
of illness based on the clinician’s total clinical experience with the relevant population. 
The CGI -S is rated on a 7 -point scale, with a range of responses from 1 (normal, not at all 
ill) through  7 (amongst  the most  extremely  ill patients).  The CGI-I asks the clinician  to rate 
the patients’ total improvement since baseline, whether or not the improvement is judged 
to be due entirely  to the experimental  treatment.  The CGI-I is rated  on a 7-point  scale,  with 
a range of responses from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). For both the 
CGI-S and the CGI -I, the clinician is allowed to use all available information at the time 
of the  rating.  
The CGI -I has emerged as a convention for bifurcating clinical trial subjects into 
“responders” and “non -responders”. In this application, the CGI -I can be a useful tool for 
gaining a general overview of the therapeutic potential of an experimental treatment. One 
of the relative  detriments  of both the CGI-S and  –I is the lack of the measures’  assessment 
of specific  sign or symptoms  associated  with the disorder  under  study  (Busner  et al., 2009). 
An approach  that has been  developed  to enhance  the precision  and clinical  meaningfulness 
of CGI ratings  is to utilize  anchor  points  that are specific  to the signs and  symptoms  of the 
disorder under  study.

Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness Scale (CGI -S): 
“Considering your total clinical experience with myotonic dystrophy patients, how 
severely ill is this patient at this time?”  
 
1- Normal, not at all ill : The patient is indistinguishable from other individuals that do not 
have myotonic dystrophy  (DM). The patient has no overt DM symptoms and no persistent 
dysfunction in the wake of having been diagnosed with  DM. 
2- Borderline ill : The patient has very occasional DM symptoms that seem modestly 
excessive in intensity, frequency or duration compared to individuals that have not been 
diagnosed  with DM. These  symptoms  have  only a transient  impact  on functioning,  with no 
need for any special  intervention.  
3- Mildly ill : The patient has occasional DM symptoms that seem modestly excessive in 
intensity or duration, or the patient experiences very occasional DM symptoms that are 
modestly  excessive  both in intensity  and duration  as compared  to individuals  without  a DM 
diagnosis. These symptoms have a limited impact on the patient’s functioning, generally 
only in one setting, and require that others make some adjustments or accommodations in 
interacting with this  patient.  
4- Moderately ill : This DM patient is clearly distinguishable from other individuals because 
of his/her  DM symptoms  and the impairment  that they cause.  The patient’s  DM symptoms 
are clearly excessive in frequency, intensity or duration compared to others that have not 
received a DM diagnosis, and have limited impact on the patient’s functioning in multiple 
settings or moderate impact in one setting. Caregivers, family members, teachers and co- 
workers make adjustments when interacting with this patient to avoid exacerbation of 
his/her symptoms and to deal with them when they  occur.  
5- Markedly  ill: This patient’s  DM symptoms  occur  frequently  and are noticeable  in intensity 
or duration to even casual observers or occur infrequently but are quite intense or long - 
lasting. There is moderate impact on the patient’s functioning in multiple settings or 
extreme  impact  in one setting.  Caregivers,  family  members,  teachers  and co-workers  utilize 
interventions that are necessary in order to deal with this patient’s symptoms. Special 
accommodations  related  specifically  to the patient’s  DM symptoms  are likely  necessary  at 
home, at school or in the workplace.  
6- Severely ill : The patient’s DM symptoms occur very frequently and are noticeable in 
intensity  or duration  to even  casual  observers  or occur  infrequently  but are severely  intense 
or extremely long -lasting. Often there is marked impairment of normal day –to–day 
capabilities or skills necessary to function at school or in the workplace. Multiple 
interventions are required to address the patient’s DM symptoms to minimize 
consequences.  
7- Among the most extremely ill patients : The patient’s DM symptoms occur the majority of 
the time and are very disruptive  to functioning  in multiple  areas.  There  are very few times,

if any, of normal functioning. There are often serious concerns about the patient’s ability 
to provide adequate care for him/herself as a consequence of the DM symptoms. The 
patient requires almost constant monitoring by [CONTACT_32638].

CGI —Improvement – A User’s Guide  
1. Very Much Improved  designates marked improvement, across settings and/or across 
multiple problem areas. Although a CGI -I of [ADDRESS_788908] be very substantial and is usually accompanied by [CONTACT_597180]/or  caregiver  enthusiasm.  Such  patients  are usually  noticeably  improved  in the clinic  as 
well.  
2. Much  Improved  may denote  moderate  improvement  in a single  symptom  area,  especially 
if seen across  settings.  Likewise,  moderate  improvements  in several  areas,  even if confined 
to one setting, may warrant a rating of “Much improved.” Durability of the change should 
be taken into account. For example, a change reported for the last few hours probably 
would not warrant such a rating. On the other hand, a change that was clearly in evidence 
for the last several days or longer probably would warrant a rating of 2.  It is not necessary 
that the patient qualify for a CGI -S rating better than baseline to receive a CGI —I rating 
of 2, but often (not always) the CGI -S also  improves.  
3. Minimal Improvement  indicates modest improvements, especially if confined to one 
setting. Trivial changes or changes that are possibly present or require guesswork usually 
would be scored as 4 (the level below this  one).  
4. No Change  indicates, by [CONTACT_108], the absence of change in behavior or clinical 
presentation from baseline to subsequent assessments. Chance fluctuations and equivocal 
improvements or declines should be included  here.  
5. Minimally Worse  indicates some worsening in symptoms that are mild to moderate or 
may be confined to one  setting.  
6. Much Worse  designates moderate to moderately serve worsening. This may include 
moderate levels of worsening in a single symptom area when observed across settings. 
Moderately  severe  changes  that are confined  to one setting  may warrant  a rating  of “Much 
Worse.”  
7. Very Much Worse  designates significant worsening, across settings and/or across 
multiple  symptoms.  
N.B. The CGI -I is a rating of change ; normalization is not necessary for a rating of 1, 
although if the clinical presentation is unequivocally improved and is evident across 
settings, it suggests an Improvement score of 1. A CGI -I of 2 is appropriate for definite, 
unequivocal improvement of a magnitude that makes the clinician confident that the 
treatment  is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  An improvement  score  of 3 (or 5) is appropriate  if variations  in ratings 
and other criteria appear to represent more than random chance or rating error, but are  not

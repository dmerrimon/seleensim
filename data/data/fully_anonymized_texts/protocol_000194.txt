 Appendix D – Effect of mPATH on Screening for  Depression, Fall Risk, and 
Safety  
 
Wake Forest policy requires primary care clinics to screen patients  aged [ADDRESS_336037] staff time by [CONTACT_275224].  It is 
possible that mPATH will increase detection of depression, fall risk, and safety concern s 
because: 1) mPATH systematically asks these screening items of all patients, and  2) 
patients may feel more comfortable answering these items in an iPad survey than  
during an in -person interview.  
 
To determine the effect of mPATH on the performance of this screening, we will 
examine a limited use dataset comparing the [ADDRESS_336038] Health primary care clinics that are participating in the mPATH 
Effectiveness and Implementation  trial. 
 
Patient inclusion criteria : 
 Age 18 or older  
 Completed a provider visit at the study clinic during the 60 days prior to the clinic 
launching the mPATH program (the “pre” time period), or completed a provider 
visit at the study clinic during days 1 4 – 73 after the launch of mPATH (the “post” 
time period)  
 Have a preferred langua ge of English or Spanish  
 
Patient exclusion criteria : 
 Requiring a language interpreter for a language other than Spanish  
 
Experimental Methods  
The limited use dataset will contain the following data elements for each completed 
patient visit:

  Date of clinic  visit (where each date is indicated by a number relative to the 
clinic’s Launch Date)  
 Clinic (designated by a unique  study  clinic identifier)  
 Type of visit completed (for example, new patient visit, return patient visit, annual 
exam)  
 Patient age  
 Patient gender  
 Patient race/ethnicity  
 Patient primary insurance  
 Nursing staff who roomed the patient  (designated by a unique study identifier)  
 Whether patient used mPATH -CheckIn program (Y/N)  
 Whether nursing staff used mPATH Nursing Module to transmit mPATH data t o 
WakeOne (Y/N)  
 Whether patient has a diagnosis of depression in the problem list in the EHR 
(Y/N)  
 Whether patient has an antidepressant medication listed in the active medication 
list (Y/N)  
 Results of depression screening items  
 Results of fall risk screen ing items  
 Results of safety at home screening items  
 
The study dataset will be maintained using the procedures outlined in Section 8.0 
(Confidentiality and Privacy) . Of note, we are taking the following additional 
safeguards to further protect patient conf identiality:  
1. Dates of clinic visits will be designated using numbers relative to each clinic’s 
launch date, rather than using the actual date  
2. Clinics will be designated with a unique study clinic identifier instead of clinic 
name  
3. Nursing staff will be designated with a unique study identifier instead of actual 
name  
 
[CONTACT_275225]  
 The day a clinic  launches mPATH will be designated as that clinic’s Day 0  
 The “pre” time pe riod will be D ays -60 to -1 (the 60 day period before mPATH 
Launch)  
 The “post” time period will be days 14 to 73 (the 60 day period commencing 2 
weeks after mPATH Launch)

 Primary outcome : The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients seen in each 
time period (“pre” vs. “post”) who screen positive for depression, fall risk, or safety 
concerns at home.  
 
Secondary outcomes : Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of patients in 
each time period who : 
 Screen positive for depression using the PHQ -2 items . In addition, the outcomes 
below will be as sessed:  
o Have a PHQ9 score >14 (indicating moderately severe depression or 
severe depression)  
o Have a PHQ9 score >19 (indicating severe depression)  
o Have a PHQ9 score >[ADDRESS_336039] thoughts of self -harm  
 Screen positive for fall risk at home . In addition, the outcomes below will be 
assessed:  
o Have f allen in last [ADDRESS_336040] had a f all with injury  
 Screen positive for safety concerns at home . In addition, the outcome below will 
be assessed:  
o Report that conflic ts turn into fights  
 
Analytic plan  
Our primary analysis will compare the proportion of  patients seen in the “pre” ti me 
period to the “post” time period who screen positive for either depression, fall risk, or 
safety at home.  If a patient is seen more than once in a given time period, only the 
patient’s first visit in that time period will be included in the analyses. We will  estimate 
the proportion who screen positive for each time period and report along with 95% 
confidence i ntervals. A chi -square test will be used to provide an unadjusted 
comparison between the “pre” and “post” proportions. Logistic regression models will 
then be used to compare the “pre” and “post” proportions while controlling for clinic and 
patient demogra phic variable s. We will use the same analytic methods for our 
secondary outcomes.  We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis for our primary 
outcome where we consider all patients’ visits during a given time period  (and not limit 
analyses to a patient’s f irst visit in the time period only) . For this sensitivity analysis, we 
will compare the proportion of patients who meet our primary outcome definition at any 
visit during the “pre” and “post” time periods.   
 
Analytic adjustments due to COVID19 pandemic : Due to the COVID19 pandemic, all 
practices stopped using mPATH in March 2020, which is prior to the closure of the 60 -
day “post” time period for clinics #5 and #6 in our sample. Therefore, we will truncate

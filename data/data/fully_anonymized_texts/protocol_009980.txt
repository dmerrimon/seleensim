Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  7 Confidential  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Endpoints:  
Exposure to OKZ in plasma  will be assessed as follows:  
• Blood samples will be collected from all subjects periodically throughout the study, including at each 
time a blood sample is taken for the determination of antidrug antibodies (ADAs)  (ADA/PK matched 
subjects) , with the except ion of the final Follow -Up Visit .  However, PK samples will not be analyzed 
unless the subject has a confirmed positive ADA response.  If formation of ADAs is observed in any 
postdose sample, all PK samples for that subject will be analyzed.  
• At least one -third (33%) of the subjects in the OKZ treatment groups will be randomly selected to have 
their PK samples analyzed for OKZ concentrations in plasma.  The randomization will be such that an 
equal number of subjects will be included from both O KZ treatment groups.  Data for these subjects 
will be included in future planned population PK modeling.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Correlations:  
The PK/PD relationship and immunogenicity of OKZ will be assessed by:  
• Characterizing the dose/exposu re-response relationships related to efficacy endpoints 
(e.g., ACR20  response) and identifying potential factors that may impact the efficacy endpoints  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure- response relationships related to safety endpoints (e.g., lipi[INVESTIGATOR_386504]) and identifying potential factors that may impact the safety endpoints  
• Evaluating the impact of ADAs on subject safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ  
Safety Endpoints:  
• The nature, incidence, severity, and outcome of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  
• Proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities  
• Assessment of changes over time in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and phy sical 
examination findings  
• Incidence and titer of ADAs to OKZ, incidence of neutralizing antibodies, and the time course of antibodies  
Methodology:  
The CREDO 2  study includes a 4 -week Screening Period, a double -blind Treatment Period from Week  0 to 
Week 24, and a S afety Follow -Up Period from Week  24 to Week 44. 
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study during a 4 -week Screening Period.  At randomization, 
a total of 1575 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2:2 :2:1 ratio (450, 
450, 450, and 225 subjects per group , respectively) : 
1. OKZ 64  mg q4w :  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of placebo OKZ 
q4w to maintain blinding)  + MTX . 
2. OKZ 64  mg q2w :  SC injection of OKZ  64 mg q2w  + MTX . 
3. Adalimumab 40 mg q2w:  SC injection of adalimumab 40 mg q2w + MTX.  
4. Placebo :  SC injection of placebo OKZ q2w + MTX.  
Throughout the double -blind Treatment Period, all subjects will be required to remain on a stable dose of 
background MTX at 15  to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) 
with a stable route of administration , and concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥[ADDRESS_597410] dose of study treatment  (OKZ , adalimumab,  or placebo) will be at 
Week  22 in all groups .  Following Visit 2 ( randomization ), subjects will return to the study site at least every 
other week through Week [ADDRESS_597411] 20% in both swollen and tender  joint counts

sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine  as rescue medication in addition to the assigned treatment.  
After completion of the 24- week , double -blind Treatment Period, subjects will either roll over into the 
long-term open -label extension (OLE) study or enter the S afety Follow -Up Period .  During the Safety 
Follow -Up Period, subjects will return for visits  +4, +8, and + [ADDRESS_597412] dose of study treatment  at 
Week  22 as per the S chedule of Events (Visits  SFU-1 [Week  26], SFU-2 [Week  30], and SFU-3 [Week  44], 
respectively).  
Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study (starting when the subject signs the informed consent 
form [ ICF]) and evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
Subjects who discontinue the randomized treatment prematurely will be required to come for the End  of 
Treatment (EoT) Visit [ADDRESS_597413] study treatment  administration and then continue with the  
scheduled study visits as per the Schedule of Events . 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by [CONTACT_47399]’s designee.  I n addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_386531] (DSMB).  
Planned number of subjects:  A total of 1575 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1  of 4 treatment 
groups in a 2:2:2:1 ratio (450, 450, 450, and 225 subjects per group , 
respectively).  
Treatment population:  Subjects with moderately to severely active RA and an inadequate 
response to treatment with MTX therapy.  
Diagnosis and  
main criteria for inclusion:  Male or female subjects ≥[ADDRESS_597414], dose and mode of administration:  Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody  specific for 
interleukin -6 (IL-6). 
Subjects randomized to receive OKZ will be administered OKZ 64  mg via 
SC injection either q2w or q4w, depending on the randomization group . 
Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration:  Adalimumab (Humira
®):  Adalimumab  is a TNFi  that is licensed  for 
treating RA in several regions, including the US  and EU.  Subjects 
randomized to receive adalimumab will be administered adalimumab 40 mg q2w via SC injection as an active comparator . 
Placebo :  The placebo will contain no active pharmaceutical ingredi ents.  
Subjects randomized to the placebo group  will be administered placebo 
via SC injection q2w.  
To maintain the blind, subjects randomized to receive OKZ q4w will also 
receive placebo injections at the alternate q4w interval (e.g., Week  2, 
Week  6, etc).   Placebo will be administered in blinded syringes with the 
same appearance as syringes containing OKZ . 
MTX :  Subjects in all 4  treatment groups  will continue their concomitant 
background therapy (MTX) at a stable dose of 15  to 25 mg/week (or 
≥10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) with a 
stable route of administration (oral, SC, or intramuscular [ IM]).

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  9 Confidential  Statistical Methods: 
Calculation of Sample Size  
Given that the study will be considered successful if at least 1  of the  2 OKZ dose regimens is shown to be 
efficacious and that a priori both OKZ dose regimens are assumed to be efficacious, disjunctive power (i.e., a 
probability of detecting a significant treatment effect for at least 1  OKZ treatment regimen)  will be used  as a 
criterion for the estimation of the sample size .  Sample size requirements are calculated to provide sufficient 
disjunctive power to evaluate the primary endpoint ( superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to 
ACR20  response rate at Week  12) and 3 secondary endpoints (noninferiority of OKZ relative to adalimumab 
with respect to the ACR20 response rate at Week [ADDRESS_597415] to the 
proportion of subjects with DAS28 ( CRP)  <3.[ADDRESS_597416] to the proportion of subjects with DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 at Week 12) .  Sample size was estimated 
taking into account a multiplicity control procedure and the resulting α adjustment that will be used in this study 
to control an overall Type I error rate in the strong sense at a 1 -sided α  = 0.[ADDRESS_597417] null hypotheses previously rejected for all endpoints (primary and secondary) that precede this endpoint in a fixed order of testing as per the gate -
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502] . 
Treatment effect assumptions used in the simulation -based sample size calculations involving the primary and 
the 3 selected secondary endpoints  are as follows.  
The ACR20  response rate at Week  12 for the placebo group  is estimated to be 25% in this study population .  
The OKZ ACR20  response rates for the [ADDRESS_597418] 50% and 5 5%, respectively, resulting in an expected difference in ACR20  response rates of [ADDRESS_597419] 52.5% at Week  12.  A noninferiority 
margin of 12% is used for the comparison between OKZ and adalimumab.  
The DAS28 low disease activity (based on DAS28 [CRP] <3.2) response rate at Week 1 2 is estimated to be 
10% in the placebo group  and 22% and 30% in the OKZ 64 mg q4w and q2w treatment groups  respectively, 
resulting in an expected difference of 12 and 20 percentage points between respective OKZ treatment groups  
and placebo.  
The DAS28 low disease activity (based on DAS28 [CRP] <3.2) response rate for adalimumab is expected to be 
at least 27% at Week 12.  A noninferiority margin of 7.5% is used for the comparison between OKZ and 
adalimumab with respect to this endpoint.  
The references cited above for ACR20 and DA S28 response rates are assumed to reflect approximately 10% of 
subjects discontinuing randomized treatment  prior to Week  12.  In this study, subjects who discontinue prior to 
Week  [ADDRESS_597420] to the proportion o f subjects with 
DAS28  (CRP ) <3.[ADDRESS_597421] to the 
proportion of subjects with DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 at Week 1 2. 
The primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints that are binary in nature wil l be analyzed using a 
2×[ADDRESS_597422] to ACR20 rate and 
DAS28 low disease activity rate at Week  12 will be carried out based on a 97.5% 2- sided confidence interval 
for difference between proportions (OKZ versus adalimumab) and comparing the lower confidence limit with 
the noninferiority margin of - 12% for the ACR20 rate and the noninferiority margin of - 7.5% for the DAS28 
low disease activity rate . 
Based on the treatment effect assumptions and the methodology for estimating sample size via simulation to 
ensure sufficient disjunctive power as described above, a sample size of 1575  subjects randomized in a

testing the primary hypothesis (superiority of OKZ to placebo with respect to ACR20 rate at Week 12), 92% 
disjunctive power for testing the secondary hypothesis of noninferiority of OKZ to adalimumab with respect to 
ACR20 rate at Week 1 2, 92% disjunctive power for the evaluation of the secondary endpoint of superiority of 
OKZ to placebo with resp ect to D AS28 (CRP) <3.2 rate at Week 1 2, and 88% disjunctive power for testing the 
secondary hypothesis of noninferiority of OKZ to adalimumab with respect to DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 rate at 
Week  12. 
Selection of N oninferiority Margin  
In a meta -analysis of 2 key pi[INVESTIGATOR_466017] , the difference between the 
ACR20 response rate at Week 12 for adalimumab+MTX (N=280) and placebo+MTX (N=262) was equal to 35% (95% confidence interval :  27.3% to 42.6%) .  Therefore, 27.3% is the abso lute largest noninferiority 
margin that could be justified .  Using an assumption of 55% ACR20 response rate at Week 1 2 for adalimumab 
and a more conservative minimum lower bound of 43% for OKZ is considered to be clinically meaningful .  As 
a result, we use a noninferiority margin of 12%  for ACR20 response rate at Week 12 . 
In a meta -analysis of 2 clinical studies of adalimumab, the difference between the DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response 
rate at Week 12 for adalimumab+MTX (N=537) and placebo+MTX (N=688) was equal to  20% (95% 
confidence interval:  15.3% to 24.6%).  Therefore, 15.3% is the absolute largest noninferiority margin that could be justified.  Using an assumption of 27% for DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at Week 12 for adalimumab and a more conservative minim um lower bound of 19.5% for OKZ is considered to be clinically 
meaningful.  As a result, we use a noninferiority margin of 7.5% for DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at Week  12. 
Analysis Populations  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population :  The ITT population will include all randomized subjects .  Subjects 
will be  analyzed according to the treatment  group  to which they were randomized .  The ITT 
population will be the primary analysis population.  
• Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) population :  The mITT population will i nclude all randomized 
subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study treatment .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment  group  to which they were randomized .  The mITT population, if sufficiently different from 
the ITT population  (>5% of ITT su bjects excluded from mITT across all treatment groups) , will be 
used for supportive analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• Per Protocol (PP) population :  The PP population will include all ITT subjects who do not have any 
major protocol violations .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment  group  to which they 
were randomized .  Major protocol violations and the inclusion of subjects in the PP population will be 
finalized prior to study unblinding .  The PP population will be use d for supportive analyses of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• Safety population:  The S afety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study 
treatment .  Subjects in the S afety population will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually 
received.  In addition to the primary safety analysis the incidence of AEs will be analyzed separately 
for subjects administered an additional disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug (DMARD) as rescue 
medication during the Treatment Period  and for subjects who did not receive rescue medication . 
• Pharmacokinetics population :  The PK population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_597423] 1 evaluable postdose O KZ concentration without important protocol 
deviations or events affecting the PK results . 
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT population .  Supportive analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints will also be conducted using the mITT  (if sufficien tly different from the ITT 
population) and PP  populations .  All comparisons for efficacy assessments will be carried out based on study 
treatment groups  to which the subjects were originally randomized . 
No adjustment for covariates will be included in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint or the analysis of 
the secondary and other endpoints that are binary in nature .  Analyses of the continuous efficacy endpoints will

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  11 Confidential  be adjusted for baseline values of the corresponding parameters.  
Endpoints for esta blishing superiority of OKZ to placebo that are binary in nature will be analyzed using a 
2×[ADDRESS_597424] to ACR20 rate and DAS28 (CRP) <3. 2 response rate at Week 12 will be carried out 
based on a 97.5% 2- sided confidence interval for differences between proportions (OKZ versus adalimumab) 
using the Newcombe hybrid score method and comparing the lower confidence limit with the noninferiority 
margin s of -12% and -7.5%, respectively, for the ACR20 and DAS28 (CRP) endpoints .  Endpoints that are 
continuous in nature will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and adjusted for the baseline value of the corresponding parameter . 
Other statistical methods and models will be used to investigate sensitivity to missing data and adherence to 
randomized treatment . 
Multiplicity Adjustment  
Each of the OKZ treatment groups  (64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w) will be compared with placebo for each of the 
primary, secondary, and other endpoints .  If adalimumab is shown to be superior to placebo, then e ach of the 
OKZ treatment groups  will also be compared with adalimumab with respect to  the ACR20 re sponse rate and the 
DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at Week  12.  The overall Type I error rate will be controlled for testing 
hypotheses of the primary and secondary endpoints at the overall 1 -sided α  = 0.025.  
The following hypothesis tests will be included in the multiplicity control procedure :  superiority of each OKZ 
group  versus placebo for the primary endpoint (ACR20 response rate at Week 1 2), noninferiority of each OKZ 
group  versus adalimumab for the secondary endpoint (ACR20 response r ate at Week 1 2), superiority of each 
OKZ group versus placebo for the secondary endpoint DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at Week 12, 
noninferiority of each OKZ group versus adalimumab for the secondary endpoint DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response 
rate at Week 12, and  superiority of each OKZ group  versus placebo for the remaining 3  secondary endpoints  
(HAQ -DI improvement at Week 1 2, ACR50 at Week 24, and CDAI  ≤2.8 at Week 24) .  The test for assay 
sensitivity (superiority of adalimumab versus placebo with respect to ACR20 and DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response 
rate at Week 1 2) is not included in the multiplicity control strategy due to the ancillary nature of this test and 
will be carried o ut using a 1 -sided α = 0.[ADDRESS_597425] for noninferiority of OKZ versus 
adalimumab.  
The α- control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related to each of the 
2 OKZ dose regimens versus placebo (i.e., usin g the 1 -sided α  = 0.0125 for each  OKZ  dose regimen) .  A 
gate-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_386505] .  In other words, each OKZ dose regimen will be tested at 1 -sided α  = 0.0125 for a 
given endpoint if null hypotheses are rejected at 1-sided α  = 0.0125 for this dosing regimen for all previous 
endpoints based on the established order .  Conversely, the testing will stop for a given OKZ dose regimen at the 
endpoint f or which the null hypothesis is accepted at 1 -sided α  = 0.0125.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
All subjects will have blood samples collected for potential PK analysis.  At least 33% of subjects in the OKZ 
treatment groups will be randomly selected to have their  PK samples analyzed, and OKZ  concentrations  will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_386534] .  Time to steady state will be 
graphically evaluated for the OKZ trough data collected throughout  the study.  Pharmacokinetic relati onships 
will be explored graphically and with linear or nonlinear modeling approaches, as appropriate.  D ata collected 
in this study may be combined with data from other OKZ studies in support of population PK analyses . 
Olokizumab c oncentration data for the subjects not randomly selected as part of the main analysis will only be 
analyzed and presented as part of the PK summaries if the subject has a confirmed positive ADA response in at 
least 1 of the postdose samples collected during the T reatment Period .  Olokizumab results will be presented 
separately for the ADA -positive subjects and combined, as appropriate.  Futhermore, t hese data may  be 
included the population PK analyses  or in a separate PK assessment of ADA -positive subjects , as appropriate . 
Safet y Analysis  
Major components for the safety analysis will include:  
• AEs will be solicited at every study visit, recorded, and coded according to the most recent version of 
R-Pharm  
CL04041023:  C linical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 2  
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  12 Confidential  the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). 
• SAEs  
• Vital signs and physical examination findings  
• Laboratory parameters  
• Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and other specialized test findings  
All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis .  Adverse events will be listed 
for each subject and summar ized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the most 
recent  version of the MedDRA .  In addition, summaries of AEs by [CONTACT_386535] .  All safety and tolerability data recorded during  the study will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570] , and over time, as appropriate.  
Safety results will be summarized and presented with particular focus on safety concerns identified as AESIs , 
based either upon the safety data available to date fo r OKZ or drug class -related events for a biologic 
IL-[ADDRESS_597426] an increased risk of cardiovascular ( CV) events .  To fully assess the CV 
risks associated with OKZ, the following approach  will be used : 
1. Potential major adverse cardiac events (MACE) will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_386536] ( CVAC ) according to a predefined charter .  The charter will define the 
criteria, data, and source documentation required to adjudicate all MACE . 
2. Baseline CV risks including individual risk factors  (e.g., tobacco use, presence of hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 
3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends related to long- term 
exposure.  
Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), all subjects will be followed for approximately 
5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22  weeks) after the final dose of study treatment . 
Subjects who dis continue randomized treatment early  (i.e., prior to Week 24)  will adhere to the established 
double -blind Treatment Period visit schedule  outlined in the study Schedule of Events , as if  they were still 
receiving study treatmen t.  In addition, all subjects who discontinue study treatment early will undergo  a full 
safety assessment at the EoT Visit +[ADDRESS_597427] dose of study treatment  (OKZ , adalimumab,  or 
placebo ), as well as extended Safety Follow -Up assessments +4, + 8, and +[ADDRESS_597428] scheduled dose  of study treatment and not entering 
the OLE  study , the EoT Visit will be performed at Visit 15 ( Week 24 ) and extended Safety  Follow -Up Visits 
will be scheduled  for +4, +8, and + [ADDRESS_597429] dose of study treatment  (i.e., Visits SFU -1 [Week 26], 
SFU-2 [Week  30], and SFU -3 [Week 44], respectively ).

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  25 Confidential  2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune/inflammatory disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_386537], with synovial cell proliferation and destructive changes in bone and 
cartilage of multiple joints .  Untreated, RA can lead to destruction, deformation, and 
dysfunction of affected joints, which may result in significant morbidity, and accelerated mortality ( Jacobsson et a l, 2007) .  Moderately to severely active RA is often treated with 
disease- modifying anti- rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with methotrexate (MTX) being the 
most commonly used conventional DMARD (cDMARD) .  For patients  with an inadequate 
response to cDMARDs, biologic agents (i.e., biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs]) are the next 
step, and include, but are not limited to, tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) inhibitors (TNFi), 
interleukin -6 (IL -6) receptor (IL -6R) antagonists, and T -cell co -stimulation modulators .  
Among the se, TNFi, especially in combination with MTX, are used most often 
(Smolen  et al, 2014) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_386507]/or bDMARD therapy, 
approximately 30% to 40% of patients  with established RA fail to respond and 50% to 60% 
of patients  fail to achieve a major clinical American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
response or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response 
(Marchesoni  et al, 2009; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh , 2009; Cohen et al, 2008) .  Even among 
responders, the majority do not achieve remission.  T hus, there continues to be an unmet 
medical need for new therapeutic approaches in the RA patient population. 
One such therapeutic approach is to target  IL-[ADDRESS_597449] differentiation , which subsequently contributes to joint 
destruction.  D ue to the key role played by [CONTACT_8668] -6 in several RA mechanisms, targeting IL -6 is 
considered an attractive therapeutic option.  
2.2 Study Treatment  
2.2.1 Olokizumab  
Olokizumab (OKZ; CDP6038; L04041) is being developed by R -Pharm for the treatment of 
moderately to severely active RA .  Olokizumab was previously developed by 
[CONTACT_386538], and was transferred to R -Pharm for further global development.

Olokizumab  
Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  26 Confidential  Olokizumab is a humanized (complementarity determining region [CDR] -grafted) 
monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype, developed as an 
antagonist of IL -[ADDRESS_597450] utility in a wide range of 
autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.  
Interleukin- 6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a central role in 
immune regulation, inflammation, hemopoiesis, and oncogenesis, and has been linked to a 
wide range of human diseases .  It is a glycoprotein of 184 amino acids that is produced by a 
wide range of cell types includin g monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epi[INVESTIGATOR_386508], vascular endothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, glial cells, chondrocytes, T and B cells, and some tumor cells .  Stimuli of IL -6 production include TNF -α, 
lipopolysaccharides, and viral infe ctions; inhibitors of IL -6 production include 
glucocorticoids .  Within the context of an immune and inflammatory response, IL -6 has been 
shown to exert a wide range of effects, such as those described below:  
• Induction of antibody production by B cells  
• Impo rtant role in the generation of a subpopulation of T -helper cells, Th17 cells, which 
may play an important pathogenic role in a number of autoimmune diseases  
• Key driver of the acute phase response (the increased production, mainly by [CONTACT_4852], of 
soluble factors, such as C -reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA], during 
inflammation)  
In developi[INVESTIGATOR_386509] -6, potential therapeutic strategies include inhibition 
of nonsignaling IL-6R receptor alpha chain (gp80), which gives the IL -6 family members 
their specificity, and the IL-6R signal -transducing subunit (gp130) .  The identification of the 
optimum epi[INVESTIGATOR_386510] -6 (binding IL -6 in a region that is predicted to be involved 
with gp80 or gp130) was conducted using antibodies  with similar affinities , but different 
binding axes, as determined by [CONTACT_386540] ( BIAcore ).  Antibodies directed 
against mouse or human IL -[ADDRESS_597451] under a range of conditions tested.

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_597452] commonly used.  For patients with an inadequate response to 
cDMARDs, biologic agents that  inhibit TNF -α, especially in combination with MTX, are 
indicated ( Smolen et al, 2014).  Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients receiving 
biologics (i .e., approximately 40% to 50% of those receiving TNFi therapy ) have inadequate 
response to such treatment ( Marchesoni et al, 2009; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009; 
Cohen et  al, 2008).  Thus , there is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches utilizing 
alternative modes of action in this patient population. 
Olokizumab is being developed to address the unmet needs of patients with these severe, 
progressive, and de bilitating disorders through a different therapeutic approach, utilizing an 
alternative mode of action .  Within the class of therapeutic antibodies targeting the 
IL-[ADDRESS_597453], OKZ is anticipated to be more potent because of its high affinity for IL -6 and 
its axis of intervention (inhibiting the interaction between IL -6 and gp130) .  Also, since OKZ 
is of the Ig G4 isotype, it would not be expected to mediate significant levels of 
antibody -mediated complement fixation or cell- mediated cytotoxicity.  
Olokizuma b is being developed for the treatment of RA to reduce signs and symptoms of 
disease, improve physical functioning, and induce higher levels of response .  The proposed 
indication for OKZ is to be used in combination with MTX for the treatment of moderately  to 
severely active RA in adult patients who have been inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_466038] .  A separate study is planned to address the use of OKZ in a similar RA population 
who are either inadequately controlled or intolerant to previous TNFi  therapy .

In a study aimed at assessing the effects of OKZ  on prenatal and postnatal development in 
the cynomolgus monkey, the treatment was well tolerated during the pregnancy and had no 
abortifacient effect.  However, some OKZ -treated females experienced dystocia and 
placental retention, sometimes associated with significant urogenital bleeding, which resulted 
in some deaths.  Given similar human and cynomolgus monkey physiology during pregnancy 
and the risk of dystocia and hemorrhage at parturition, inhibition of IL -6 signaling during 
pregnancy is not recommended.  
Taken together, the currently completed nonclinical studies support continued clinical development for  marketing approval of OKZ.  
2.2.3 Summary of Clinical Experience  
Nonclinical data were deemed sufficient to support clinical development of OKZ in humans

inflammatory diseases, and oncological diseases with IL -[ADDRESS_597456] been investigated in 3  Phase I clinical studies 
(RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074) and 2 Phase II clinical studies (RA0056 and RA0083) .  
The safety and efficac y of OKZ were also studied in long -term open -label extension (OLE) 
studies for both Phase II studies (RA0057 and RA0089).

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  30 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Safety Data from O lokizumab Studies  
Study RA0001 
There were no deaths or serious adve rse events (SAEs) reported during the study and no 
subject discontinued the study as a result of an adverse event (AE) .  The overall incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was slightly higher in the placebo group overall 
(18 subjects [52.9% ]; 35 events) than in the OKZ treatment groups overall (11 subjects 
[33.3%]; 26 events) .  No increase in the incidence of TEAEs was observed with increasing 
dose of OKZ.  
The most commonly  reported TEAEs were in the system organ classes (SOCs) of 
gastrointe stinal (GI) disorders, general disorders, and infections and infestations .  The 
incidence of GI disorders was similar in both the OKZ group overall (12.1%) and the placebo 
group overall (11.8%); however, at the preferred term (PT) level, abdominal distensi on 
([ADDRESS_597457] [3.0%]), abdominal pain ([ADDRESS_597458] [3.0%]), and vomiting (2 subjects [6.1%]) were 
only seen in the OKZ group.  T he most frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in ≥3% of 
subjects in any treatment group) by [CONTACT_386544] -like illness (11.8% placebo, 
6.1%  OKZ), headache (11.8% placebo, 3.0%  OKZ), nasopharyngitis (8.8% placebo, 
3.0%  OKZ), rhinitis (8.8% placebo, 0.0% OKZ), diarrhea (5.9% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), and 
vomiting (0.0% placebo, 6.1% OKZ).  
For the majority of hematology  and clinical chemis try parameters there were no clinically 
significant differences in mean actual values between the placebo group and OKZ treatment  
groups, and no clinically significant fluctuations in mean actual values over time. 
Study RA0010 
There were no deaths during Study RA0010.  T wo subjects ([ADDRESS_597459] in the placebo 
IV+MTX group and [ADDRESS_597460] in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC+MTX group) experienced SAEs :  
Bowen’s disease and worsening of RA, respectively .  Neither event was considered by [CONTACT_466039] s tudy treatment.  O ne subject in the placebo+MTX overall 
group withdrew from the study as a result of exacerbation of their RA .  All subjects (100%) 
in the placebo+MTX overall group and 96.7% of subjects in the OKZ+MTX overall group 
experienced at least 1  TEAE .  The incidence of TEAEs did not increase with increasing dose 
of OKZ+MTX administered ; although, a slightly higher number of AEs were experienced by 
[CONTACT_386546]  (1 mg/kg and 3  mg/kg) +MTX SC treatment groups 
(16 subjects  [94.12%]; 101 events) compared with the OKZ  (0.1 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg)  + MTX

In Study RA0074, there were no deaths, SAEs, severe AEs, or AEs that led to 
discontinuation.  T he incidence of TEAEs was higher in the OKZ groups compared with the 
placebo group.  I n the placebo group, 50% of subjects (2 of 4) had TEAEs (6  events), 
compared with 75% of subjects (3 of 4) in the OKZ 3 mg/kg treatment group (11 events), and 100% of subjects (4 of 4) in each of the OKZ 0.3 mg/kg (16  events), OKZ 1  mg/kg 
(25 events), and OKZ 6 mg/kg (24  events) treatment groups .  The incidence of TEAEs did 
not appear to be related to the dose of OKZ administered.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs were within the SOCs of general disorders and 
adminis tration site conditions ; investigations ; GI disorders ; infections and infestations ; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic and mediastinal disorders ; and skin and SC  tissue disorders .  Events 
occurring in >20% of subjects in the OKZ overall group, by [CONTACT_6214], included injection site hematoma (31.3%), abdominal pain (25.0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased 
(25.0%) .  The overall incidence of TEAEs in the OKZ -treated groups was higher than in the 
placebo -treated group, but given the small number of subjects in each tre atment group, it is 
not possible to make any meaningful conclusions.  
In Studies  RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074, OKZ was tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg SC 
(all studies), 6  mg/kg SC ( Study RA0074 only), and 10 mg/kg IV ( Study RA0001 only) .  
There were no deaths in any of these studies and only [ADDRESS_597461] 
in Study RA0010 discontinued the study early due to an AE (exacerbation of RA symptoms), but no subjects withdrew from Study RA0001 or Study RA0074 due to TEAEs. 
Study RA0056 
In Stu dy RA0056, OKZ was well tolerated at doses of up to 240 mg q2w .  Serious AEs were 
reported by 6 subjects in the OKZ groups and 3 subjects in the placebo groups .  A total of 
11 subjects in the OKZ and placebo groups discontinued due to TEAEs ([ADDRESS_597462] in the placebo group ).  Overall, [ADDRESS_597463] subjects discontinuing due to

Study RA0010 
Preliminary efficacy data in terms of the Disease Activity Score 28 -joint Count 
(DAS28 ) (CRP) were obtained in Study RA0010.  A n indication of the efficacy of OKZ was 
obtained in the subpopulation of subjects with a baseline DAS28  (CRP) of >3.2 (i.e., those 
with moderate to high disease activity) .  Although the number of subjects falling into this 
moderate to high category was small, improvements in DAS28 (CRP) were seen following 
OKZ+MTX administration, especi ally in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC+MTX group.  
Study RA0056 
In Study RA0056, a greater improvement in least squares (LS) mean DAS28 (CRP) from 
baseline at Week  [ADDRESS_597488] improvement observed in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group.  
The overall dose -response trend (across the q4w and q2w dosing frequencies) was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001) .  Comparisons of dosing frequency (q2w versus q4w) and 
dose-by-dose frequency interactions (q2w trend versus q4w trend) were not statistically 
significant.  T he secondary efficacy variables were ACR  20% (ACR20), 50% (ACR50), and 
70% (ACR70) response criteria at Week  12 for the OKZ and placebo treatment groups .  The 
ACR20  and ACR50 estimated respon se rates at Week  12 were higher in all OKZ treatment  
groups compared with the placebo groups .  Very few subjects in any treatment group were 
ACR70  responders; however, those subjects that were ACR70 responders were all in the 
OKZ treatment groups.  
Study RA 0083 
In Study RA0083, a greater improvement in LS mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week  [ADDRESS_597489] improvement observed in the OKZ 240 mg 4 -week

[IP_ADDRESS] Summary of P harmacokinet ic Data from O lokizumab Studies  
Studies RA0001, RA0010, and RA0056 
Single dose PK of OKZ were studied in Studies RA0001 (healthy non- Asian), 
RA0074 (healthy Japanese), and RA0010 (subjects with RA) .  Sparse sampling following 
repeated administration of OKZ was performed in non-Asian and Asian subjects with RA in 
Studies RA0056 and RA0083, respectively .  Exposure to OKZ following single dose 
administration appeared to be similar in non- Asian and Asian volunteers .  Following SC 
administration, maximum plasma concentrations were generally reached between 
approximately 4  days (in Study RA0074, 6 mg/kg SC) and 1 4 days (in Study RA0001, 
1 mg/kg SC) .  Over the 0.3 to 6 mg/kg SC dose range evaluated in Studies RA0001 and 
RA0074, the median terminal half -life ranged from 30.1 to 39.6 days .  The PK profile of 
OKZ in S tudy RA0010 (non- Asian RA volunteers) was similar to that seen in healthy 
volunteers in S tudy RA0001 for the same doses .  The maximum concentration of OKZ 
following SC administration was achieved within a median of 7  to 13 days following 
3 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg dosing, respect ively .  The estimate of terminal half -life across doses 
and routes of administration was 31 days (median range:  1 2 to 63 days).  
Pharmacokinetic bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration was estimated to be 63% across the 3  studies evaluated ( Studies RA 0001, RA0010, and RA0056) .  Population PK 
analysis utilizing sparse plasma concentration versus time data collected in RA0056  along 
with intense PK data collected in Studies RA0001 and RA0010 indicated similar PK characteristics of OKZ in subjects with mod erately to severely active RA and in healthy 
subjects .  Body weight was found to be the only “statistically significant” covariate on 
volume of distribution.  
2.2.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose regimens of OKZ to be evaluated in this Phase III study are 64 mg q2w and 64 mg  q4w .  The rationale for selecting these dose regimens for further investigation is 
provided below.  
In the Phase II studies , RA0056 and RA0083, the primary efficacy var iable was met in all 
OKZ treatment groups, demonstrating improvement compared with placebo groups and a 
statistically significant overall dose -response trend as evidenced by [CONTACT_386556]28 (CRP) .  Study RA0001 demonstrated that OKZ was pharmacologically active at 
all doses tested .  This finding was supported by [CONTACT_386557] 
R-Pharm  
CL04041023:  C linical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 2  
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  40 Confidential  subsequent Phase I/IIa study , RA0010, conducted in subjects with mild to moderate RA .  The 
data from these studies highlight the potency of OKZ as well as the existence of 
dose-response dependence, shown by [CONTACT_386558] .  The relatively flat concentration -effect relationship for 
safety outcomes and the dose -dependent occurrence of injection site reactions for the 
OKZ  [ADDRESS_597491] efficacy gains versus the 120 mg dose 
regimens, led to the exclusion of the 240 mg dose regimen from further evaluation in the 
Phase III program .  This decisi on was further supported by [CONTACT_386559] 2 injections of 120 mg OKZ in order to achieve the 240 mg dose level even 
with the new 160 mg/m L formulation . 
In a thorough dose -response analysis using the combined database from the [ADDRESS_597492] slightly lower efficacy in the modeling 
analysis ; however , in both Phase II studies that were conducted in rel atively difficult to treat 
population of subjects  resistant to 1 or more TNFi biologics, the 60 mg monthly treatment  
groups showed statistically significant efficacy .  While there was not a detectable increase in 
safety events observed with doses above 120 mg monthly, there also did not seem to be a 
substantial gain in efficacy with higher doses .  Thus, the 120 mg monthly dose, administered 
as either 60  mg q2w  or 120 mg q4w , seemed to be associated with optimal efficacy/safety 
ratio.  The lower [ADDRESS_597493] volume that  can be used in Phase III (0.4 mL) results in a nominal 
dose of 64 mg rather than 60 mg . 
Consequently, using the primary efficacy outcomes from individual Phase II studies, and additional dose -response analysis performed on a combined database derived from these 
studies, 2  OKZ dose regimens were selected for further investigation :  64 mg SC q2w and 
64 mg SC q4w since totality of the data strongly suggested that both of these dose regimens could potentially be successful in a large Phase III program.  
2.3 Adalimumab  
Adalimu mab (Humira®) (Abbvie 2016)  is a TNFi that is licensed for treating RA in several 
regions, including the US and European Union ( EU).  Patients receiving TNFi, including 
adalimumab, are at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_466019].  In 
clinical studies of adalimumab, the most common AEs were  injection site reaction s, most of 
which were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.  Other 
common AEs (incidence >10%) included infections (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_466020]),

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_597494] common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of 
adalimumab were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%), and pneumonia (0.3%).  
Adalimumab is administered by [CONTACT_466043].  For adult patients 
with RA, the recommended dose is [ADDRESS_597495] a 24 -week period.  
Adalimumab 40 mg q2w SC has been included as the active comparator for assay sensitivity 
and non- inferiority evaluations  (see Section 6.2.2).  
Due to the nature of RA and the outcome measures used (ACR response and DAS), a placebo group is necessary to obtain a reliable assessment of efficacy.  The inclusion of a 
placebo group and the duration of placebo treatment  are in accordance with health authority 
guidelines .  Due to the availability of multiple treatment options for RA,  all subjects 
identified as nonresponder s at Week 14, including those receiving placebo, will receive 
rescue medication starting  at or as close as possible to Week  14 (see Section 6.13.3).  T he 
inclusion of a control group with non- active treatment (placebo) is also justified because 
subjects will continue to receive their prior background therapy (MTX) during the study.  U p 
to 30% of placebo  subjects may still continue to demonstrate increasing therapeutic benefit 
over 6 months of MTX therapy at the same dose ( Keystone et al, 2004).  
2.5 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Olokizumab has undergone extensive nonclinical testing , and [ADDRESS_597496] been 
completed.   In the difficult -to-treat population of RA patients who previously failed TNFi 
therapy, OKZ has demonstrated efficacy in 2 Phase II stud ies (Study RA0056 [ extended with 
Study RA0057]  in 221 subjects and Study RA0083 [ extended with Study RA0089]  in 
119 As ian subjects)  using the doses of OKZ that are proposed for this Phase III study; at 
higher doses, the safety profile was similar .  Bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration 
was estimated to be 63% across 3  studies evaluated (RA0056, RA0001, and RA0010) .

Olokizumab  
Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  42 Confidential  The clinical program to date suggests that OKZ is effective in reducing disease symptoms in 
subjects with RA, and that OKZ is generally well tolerated (f or further efficacy and safety 
information , refer to the most recent version of  the Investigator’s Bro chure ).  The safety 
profile of OKZ is consistent with the known effects of IL -6 blockers.  Overall, the 
benefit/risk profile for subjects in the proposed study is favorable.  The study will provide  
valuable information on the efficacy, safety, tolerability , and PK of OKZ in subjects with 
RA, which may subsequently help to address  the unmet medical needs for this patient 
population. 
The design of this study contains adequate measures to mitigate risk factors and adequate 
safety monitoring to protect the subj ects.  Nonresponders at Week 14, defined as all subjects 
who do not improve by [CONTACT_2669] 20% in both swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender  joint 
counts  (TJC) (66 -68 joint  assessment ), will receive rescue medication (sulfasalazine and/or 
hydroxychloroquine) in addition to assigned treatment starting at or as close as possible to 
Week  14.  In the context of the progressive, severe, and debilitating nature of RA, the 
balance between risks that have been identified from cumulative safety data for OKZ and 
anticip ated efficacy/benefits remains favorable.

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_597510] successfully completed the 4 -week  Screening  Period, a total of 
1575 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2:2:2:1 ratio (450, 
450, 450, and 225 subjects per group, respectively),  as follows:  
1. OKZ 64 mg q4w :  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of 
placebo OKZ q4w to maint ain blinding)  + MTX  
2. OKZ 64 mg q2w :  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q2w  + MTX  
3. Adalimumab 40 mg q2w:  SC injection of adalimumab 40 mg q2w + MTX  
4. Placebo :  SC injection of placebo q2w  + MTX  
This is a double -blind study;  as OKZ, adalimumab, and placebo are distinguishable  (see 
Section 6.2) , study treatments will be prepared by [CONTACT_466044] (e.g., nurse) out of sight of the subject  and any blinded study team members .  
Placebo and OKZ will be p repared in blinded syringes that are identical in appearance in 
order to maintain the blind for subjects in treatment group No. 1.  The SC injections of OKZ, adalimumab, and placebo will be administered every other week by [CONTACT_10981], unblinded, and tr ained study team member who will not be involved in the management of 
study subjects.  Subjects will be dosed individually and away from other subjects to ensure that visual differences between OKZ, adalimumab, and placebo cannot be observed.  In 
addition, the unblinded study site staff will be trained in methods that must be followed and 
documented to prevent subjects from observing which SC injection they receive.  Guidance 
on specific blinding procedures will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  A s noted 
above for treatment group  No. 1, in order to maintain the blind, subjects randomized to 
receive OKZ q4w will receive placebo injections at the alternate q4w interval (e.g.,  Week  2, 
Week  6, etc) at prespecified visits as described in Table 1.  
Throughout the double -blind T reatment P eriod, all subjects will be required to remain on a 
stable dose of background MTX at 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is 
documented intolerance to higher doses) with a stable route of administration, and concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥[ADDRESS_597511] every 
other week for response and safety assessments as per Table 1.  Blood samples to assess 
OKZ concentrations in plasma wi ll be collected periodically during the Treatment Period as 
per Table 4.

Section  6.13.3).  
The last dose of study treatment (OKZ, adalimumab, or placebo) will be at Week  22 in all 
groups.  
After completion of the 24 -week , double -blind Treatment Pe riod, subjects will either roll 
over into the long- term OLE study or enter the S afety Follow -Up Period .  During the S afety 
Follow -Up Period , subjects will return for visits  +4, +8, and + [ADDRESS_597513] dose of 
study treatment at Week  22 as per Table 1 (Visit SFU -1 [Week  26], Visit SFU -2 [Week  30], 
and Visit SFU -3 [Week  44], respectively).  
Subjects who discontinue randomized study treatment early  will adhere to the  double -blind 
Treatment Period  visit schedule outlined in Table 1, as if  they were still receiving study 
treatment.   In addition, all subjects who discontinue study treatment early will be required to 
attend the EoT Visit +[ADDRESS_597514] dose of study treatment, as well as extended 
Safety  Follow -Up assessments +4 weeks (Visit  SFU -1), +8 weeks (Visit SFU -2), and 
+22 weeks ( Visit SFU -3) after the last dose of study treatment.  
Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study and evaluated using the CTCAE 
version 4.0. 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by 
R-Pharm and R -Pharm ’s designee .  In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study

charter will define the criteria, data, and source documentation required to adjudicate all 
MACE .

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  57 Confidential  2. Baseline CV risks including individual risk factors  (e.g., tobacco use, presence of 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 
3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends over 
long-term exposure. 
Cardiovascular risk assessment data will be provided to the CVAC for use in review and 
adjudication of MACE  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
5.2.2 Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), subjects will be followed  up for 
approximately 5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22 weeks) after the final dose of study treatment.  
For subjects remaining on randomized therapy until the last scheduled dose of study  
treatment  at Visit 14 (Week 22) and not entering the OLE study, a full safety assessment will 
be performed at the EoT Visit (Visit 15 [ Week 24 ]) and extended Safety Follow -Up 
procedures will be performed at visits scheduled +4, +12, and +[ADDRESS_597516] dose 
of study treatment (i.e., Visits  SFU -1 [Week  26], SFU -2 [Week  30], and SFU -3 [(Week  44], 
respectively) . 
Subjects who discontinue randomized study treatment early (i.e., prior to Week 24) will 
adhere to the  established  double -blind Treatment Per iod visit schedule outlined in Table 1, as 
if they were still receiving study treatment.  In addition, all subjects who discontinue study  
treatment early will have extended Safety Follow -Up assessments performed at the following 
time points : 
• Full safety assessment [ADDRESS_597517] dose of study treatment (EoT Visit) 
(see Section  5.4.2)  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +[ADDRESS_597518] dos e of study treatment  (Visit SFU -1)

(see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +[ADDRESS_597520] dose of study treatment (Visit SFU -3) 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
Depending on the timing  of study treatment discontinuation, it is possible that the

All eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2: 2:2:1  ratio to the OKZ , adalimumab,  
and placebo treatment groups described in Section 5.2.  A detailed description of the study 
treatment (OKZ, adalimumab, and placebo) is provided in Section 6.2. 
Background Therapy  
All subjects will continue to receive their prior background therapy (MTX) during the study.  
As per inclusion criterion No. 4 (see Section  5.3.1) , subjects must have been treated with 
MTX at a dose of 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance  to 
higher doses) for at least [ADDRESS_597559] able dose and an unchanged 
mode  of administration (oral, SC, or IM) for at least [ADDRESS_597560] be adjusted for safety reasons, this may only be done once 
during  the study .  If needed, a reduction in the MTX dose may be made according to the 
guidelines in Appendix 4 (see Section 13.4).  
Rescue Medication  
Starting at Week 14, nonresponders will be assigned rescue medication ( sulfasalazine and/or  
hydroxychloroquine ) in addition to their assigned study treatment (see Section 6.13.3).

6.2.1 Olokizumab  
Olokizumab is a humanized (CDR -grafted) mAb  of the IgG4/kappa isotype with the serine in 
the heavy chain hinge region being replaced with a proline residue .  The OKZ drug substance 
consists of a preparation of purified recombinant humanized mAb  (CDP6038; L04041) 
presented as a solution of 160 mg/mL OKZ in 30  mM histidine hydrochloride , 60 mM 
sodium chloride , 200 mM sorbitol , and 0.03% polysorbate 80 at pH  5.6.

Adalimumab ( Humira, [COMPANY_013], 2016) at a dose of [ADDRESS_597561] bo, it will be administered by [CONTACT_466048]. 
Adalimumab has been selected as an active comparator for the following reasons:  
• Based on the approved indications and various treatment guidelines in both the EU and 
the US, adalimumab is most commonly utilized as the initial therapy after the failure of 
cDMARD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_466022]. 
• Adalimumab has demonstrated efficacy in this population of RA patients 
(Humira  [adalimumab] Prescribing Information ).

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  88 Confidential  • The similar r oute of administration (SC injection ) and dosing frequency for 
administration of adalimumab and OKZ will facilitate double -blinding of this study . 
• Adalimumab (a mAb ) is more similar to OKZ than etanercept ( a soluble receptor fusion 
protein) , infliximab ( a chimeric antibody ), or certolizumab pegol ( a pegylated Fab 
fragment ).  Golimumab  is also a  mAb  like OKZ, but used much less commonly for the 
treatment of RA than adalimumab.  
6.2.3 Placebo  
Placebo ( sodium chloride 0.9%) will contain no active pharmaceutical ingredients.   In the 
US, p lacebo will be provided as either a [ADDRESS_597562] carton to contain 1 vial or 
ampoule. 
As the placebo differs in appearance from OKZ, it will be prepared by [CONTACT_466049].  Subjects randomized to the placebo group will be administered placebo by 
[CONTACT_466050] q2w.  In order to maintain the blind, subjects randomized to 
receive OKZ q4w will receive placebo at the alternate q4w interval (e.g.,  Week  2, Week  6, 
etc). 
6.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Study treatment  will be supplied in cartons containing either OKZ ( 1 vial ), Humira 
(1 pre filled syringe ), or placebo ( 1 vial /ampoule ).  Study treatment  will be packaged and 
labeled according to Good Manufacturing Practices and all applicable local country regulations with information on the study protocol number, drug identification, storage conditions, and dosage information. 
6.[ADDRESS_597563] storage of the 
study treatment (OKZ, adalimumab, and placebo) at the study site.  
Olokizumab will be shipped and stored refrigerated at +2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in a 
secure, temperature- controlled refrigerator .  Adalimumab and placebo  must be stored as per 
the manufacturer’s requirement s.  Olokizumab, adalimumab, and placebo  will be supplied 
centrally by a clinical supplies vendor .  In order to maintain t he blind, study treatments will 
be stored separately at the study site  in a secure area inaccessible to blinded study site staff .

receive will not be disclosed to the blinded study site staff, including the Investigator, study coordinator, subject, R -Pharm , or R -Pharm’s designee.  Since the study treatments are 
distinguishable, they will be prepared by [CONTACT_93305] (or their unblinded 
designee) and administered by a trained, unblinded study team member who will not be 
involved in the management of study subjects  (see Section 6.8) .  Subjects will be dosed

that is not accessible to blinded study  staff.  
Additional measures to ensure that both Investigators and subjects remain blinded to study treatment include the following:  
• Joint assessments will be made by [CONTACT_37702], blinded to both the dosing 
regimen and all other study assessments. 
• Laboratory results for CRP and ESR samples collected during the Treatment Period will 
not be available to blinded study site staff.  As ESR will be tested locally, the testing will 
be performed, reviewed, and registered by [CONTACT_386586]. 
• Certain efficacy assessments (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, DAS28 (CRP) , DAS28  (ESR), 
SDAI, and CDAI) will not be calculated by [CONTACT_386587], but will instead be computed in the statistical database for analysis purposes.  
All blinding procedures should be  respected . 
Members of the independent DSMB will separately review safety data during the study.  In the event that ongoing safety monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by [CONTACT_386588], only members of the DSMB are permitted to conduct 
additional ana lysis of the safety data.

6.13.[ADDRESS_597579] on Cytochrome P  and Transporter Pathways  
Based on nonclinical data ( refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure ), it 
is possible that OKZ may reverse IL -6-mediated inhibition of CYP or transporter pathways 
such as CYP1A1/2, 2B6, 2C9, 3A4/5, and 2C19 a nd sodium/taurocholate co- transporting 
polypeptide .  If CYP or transporter activity is de -suppressed (i.e., increased to any relevant 
extent), this may result in decreased level of drugs eliminated by [CONTACT_386589] .  As such, 
OKZ may have clinical relevan ce for CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic index and for 
which a change in effectiveness may be undesirable.  Investigators are advised to monitor 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index  (as noted in their respective package inserts/drug 
labels) and to contact [CONTACT_466052] .

The CDAI will not be calculated by [CONTACT_386587], but will 
be computed in the statistical databas e for analysis purposes . 
The CDAI will be calculated using the SJC (28 joints), TJC (28 joints), the Patient Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity ( VAS ) (in cm), and the Physician Global Assessment ( VAS ) 
(in cm) according to the following formula:

7.1.10 Health Assessments and P atient -Reported Outcomes   
The PROs that will be utilized for efficacy assessments are discussed in this section.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index  
The HAQ- DI is a patient -reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of 
the disease and its treatment on physical function .  The HAQ- DI assesses the degree of 
difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily  living activities using 20  questions .  The 
domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and 
common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2 or 3  items .  For each 
question, the level of difficulty is scored from 0  to 3 where 0  = without any difficulty, 
1 = with some difficulty, 2  = much difficulty, and 3 =  unable to do.  E ach category is given a 
score by [CONTACT_386594] (i.e., question in each category with the 
highest score f or that category).  
If the maximum score is 0  or 1, but a device related to that category is used, or help from 
another person is provided for the category, then the category score is increased to 2.  I f the 
category score is already a 2  (or above), the score in that category remains [ADDRESS_597584] responses, no disability score will be calculated.  
The HAQ- DI will also include patient assessments of pain and health on a scale of 0 to 100.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Shor t Form -36 
The SF -36 health survey is a patient -reported survey of health; it is commonly used in health 
economics as a variable in the quality -adjusted life year (QALY) calculation to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of a health treatment .  The SF -36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the 
weighted sums of the questions in their section.  E ach scale is directly transformed into a 0  to

more disability .  The higher the score , the less disability (i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to 
maximum disability and a score of 100  is equivalent to no disability).  
The 8  domains of the SF -36 are as follows:  
• Vitality  
• Physical functioning  
• Bodily pain 
• General health percep tions  
• Physical role functioning 
• Emotional role functioning 
• Social role functioning 
• Mental health  
[IP_ADDRESS] European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions  
The conceptual basis of the EQ -5D is the holistic view of health, including both the medical 
definition  and the fundame ntal importance of independent physical, emotional , and social 
functioning.  The concept of health in EQ -5D also encompasses both positive aspects 
(well -being) and negative aspects (illness).  
The EQ -5D consists of a questionnaire and a VAS and is a self -rated health status .  The 
EQ-5D records the subject’s perceptions of their own current overall health, and can be used 
to monitor changes with time.  The self -assessment questionnaire is a description of 
5 dimensions (i.e., mobility, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression).  The subject is asked to grade their own current level of function in each 
dimension into 1 of 5 degrees of disability ( extreme, severe, moderate, slight, or none).  The 
combination of these with the conditions “death” and “unconscious” enables a description of 3127 different health states.  Each health state can be ranked and transformed as a single score called the utility . 
The EQ -5D health states may be converted into a single summary index by [CONTACT_2931] a 
formula that attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension.  The index can be calculated by [CONTACT_386595] 1, the value for full health (i.e., state 
[ZIP_CODE]).  Value sets have been derived for EQ -5D in several countries using the European

[IP_ADDRESS] Work Productivity Survey – Rheumatoid Arthritis  
The WPS -RA measures the impact of RA and treatment on subject product ivity within and 
outside the home during the previous month.  I t contains 9  questions addressing employment 
status, productivity within and outside the home, and daily activities .  One item of the 
WPS- RA addresses current labor market participation.  T his is a strong indicator of work 
ability because not working implies complete loss of paid productivity .  There are also 
normative and comparative data available on employment status .  Two items capture 
self-reported work absences due to arthritis, and 2 items capture the same concept but applied 
to non- paid work.  T hese are separated into full and partial days (i.e.,  days of work missed 
and days with productivity reduced by [CONTACT_289428]) .  Additional items capture the 
respondent's estimate of the extent to w hich arthritis has interfered with the subject’s work 
productivity (paid and non- paid) on a scale of [ADDRESS_597585] month family, 
social, or leis ure activities were missed because of arthritis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue Scale  
FACIT -Fatigue is a 13 -item tool that measures an individual’s level of fatigue during their 
usual daily activities during the most recent week .  The level of fatigue is measured on a 
4-point Likert scale.  
The sum of the scoring (total score) will be used for the statistical evaluation .  If an item is 
not scored, the total score will be set to missing.

Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is responsible for making an assessment of the causal relationship between 
the study treatment and the AE .  Investigators should use their knowledge of the subject, the 
circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential al ternative causes to 
determine whether or not an AE is considered to be related to the study treatment.  The 
causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE must be characterized as 
“related” or “not related.”  T he following guidance should be ta ken into consideration:  
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of the study treatment . 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of the study treatment, or reintroduction of the study treatme nt. 
• Known association of the event with the study treatment, or with similar treatments . 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study .

Frequency, duration, and severity of infectious complications along with those requiring 
treatmen t (e.g., antibiotic, antiviral, etc) will be monitored and evaluated.  Investigators will 
also educate subjects, parents, and/or caregivers about the symptoms of infections  and will 
provide instructions on dealing with these infections . 
Physicians should e xercise caution when considering the use of OKZ in subjects with a 
history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes) that may 
predispose subjects to infections.  Study treatment should not be administered to subjects 
with active  or clinically significant infection.  Vigilance for timely detection of serious 
infection is recommended for subjects receiving biologic agents for treatment of RA, as signs 
and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acut e phase 
reaction.  Subjects must be instructed to contact [CONTACT_466055], in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate 
treatment.   The Investigator may be asked to provide relevant medical 
information/documentation (e.g., result of bacterial examination or cultures). 
Any infection that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Injection  Reactions , Inc luding Anaphylaxis  
A systemic injection  reaction is any untoward medical hypersensitivity -like event , other than 
injection site reactions, occurring during or after study treatment administration that can be at 
least possibly attributed to the study treatment .  Systemic injection reactions are further 
classified as acute and delayed based on timing and presentation of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_466025].

[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Perforation  
Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the potential for complications of diverticulitis and thus reduce the risk of GI perforations .  Therefore, subjects should be made 
aware of the symptoms potentially indicative of diverticular disease, and they should be 
instructed to alert their healthcare provider as soon as possible if these symptoms arise .  
Permanent d iscontinuation of study treatment  is required  for subjects who develop GI 
perforation.

[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity  
The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., 
laboratory test results) for all serious and non- serious cases of potential hepatotoxicity . 
Potential hepatotoxicity is define d as laboratory results that fulfill any of the following 
criteria (in all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are n ot available):  
• ALT >3× to ≤5× ULN  
• ALT >5× ULN  
• ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
Laboratory results that satisfy any of the criteria for potential hepatotoxicity  should be 
followed by a repeat test  within [ADDRESS_597601], alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin if all other laboratory results are within normal limits.  The number of LFTs included in each repeat testing may be further reduced to include only those param eters which remain abnormal (i.e., abnormalities that stabilize, 
resolve, or return to within baseline values do not require repeat testing).  
Potential hepatotoxicity events that fulfill any of the following criteria must also be recorded as SAEs in th e eCRF (i n all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not 
available):  
• ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
• ALT >8× ULN  at any time , regardless of t otal bilirubin or accompanying symptoms  
• ALT >5 × ULN f or ≥2 weeks , regardless of t otal b ilirubin o r accompanying symptoms  
• ALT >3× ULN , accompanied by [CONTACT_366147] (fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, or rash)  
For SAEs of potential hepatotoxicity , the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_386604],  as additional tests are needed to investigate all potential causes of liver toxicity  
(e.g.,  alcohol  use, hepatitis infection, biliary tract disease, and concomitant medications ).

• Cons idering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
All additional investigations should be recor ded in the eCRF via the EDC system, and all 
records should be kept as source documents at the study site.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions  
An injection site reaction is any untoward medical event occurring at the injec tion site during 
or after study treatment administration that can be at least possibly attributed to the study treatment  (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) . 
An assessment of pain, redness, swelling, induration, hemorrhage, and itching at the inje ction 
site will be performed by a physician and recorded on the specific page of the eCRF.  At all specified visits (see Table 1), the assessment of injection site reactions will be made prior to any administration of study treatment.  All local reactions that are observed will be 
monitored until they resolve.

The CVAC will be responsible for evaluating MA CE and will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment .  The importance of the CVAC is to ensure that all potential MACE  that have 
been reported are judged uniformly by a single group, using the same adjudication criteria . 
Data on the following  fatal and nonfa tal MACE ( as further defined in the CVAC Charter) 
will be collected and the events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_386606] (as well as assessed by [CONTACT_40746]) :

complete all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken, outcome, 
and relationship to study treatment.  E ach event should be recorded separately.  
Investigators will be instructed to report to R -Pharm ’s designee their assessment of the 
potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, studied disease state, study treatment, and/or drug delivery system via eCRF.  
Study site staff will record any dosage of study treatment that exceeds the assigned dosage in the protocol via eCRF.  
Any clinically significant findings from laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, other 
procedures, etc. should be reported to R -Pharm ’s designee  via eCRF, EDC, and/or designated 
data transmission methods .  Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts 
when recording AEs on the AEs eCRF page, avoiding colloquialisms and abbreviations .  
Only 1  AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AEs eCRF page .  For AEs other 
than injection -related reactions , a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the AEs  eCRF 
page rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases) .  However, if a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a si ngle diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AEs eCRF page .  If 
a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and 
symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [ADDRESS_597604] also be recorded in the AE page of 
the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient- Reported Outcome  Data  
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data .  However, if any subject responses 
suggestive of a possible AE are identified during study site review of the PRO 
questionnaires, study site staff will alert the Investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an AE have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the subject's medical record per study site pract ice.  I f the event meets the criteria for an AE, it will be 
reported on the AEs eCRF.

normally again, Investigators must enter the SAE in the eCRF pages .  All SAEs should be 
followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or until the event is otherwise 
explained .  The timelines and procedure fo r follow -up reports are the same as those for the 
initial report.  R -Pharm’s designee  is responsible for managing the safety database.  
R-Pharm will be alerted of all SAEs occurring during a subject’s follow -up regardless of the 
Investigator’s assessment of  causality .  SAEs occurring after a subject has received the last 
dose of study treatment will be collected  and report ed to R -Pharm’s designee through the end 
of the Follow -Up Period (i.e., for a period of  [ADDRESS_597606] dose of study treatment) , 
regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_17963].  The Investigator must  also inform 
participating subjects of the need to inform the Investigator of any SAE that occurs within 
this period.  Any SAE with a start date  after the Follow -Up Period is not required to be 
reported unless the Investigator thinks that an event may be related to either the study 
treatment , study treatment administration, or a protocol procedure . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of S erious Adverse Events  to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigators  
R-Pharm’s designee will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and Investigators, in accordance with national regulations in the count ries where 
the study is conducted.  R elative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to

Any AEs that occur after the subject has signed the ICF until the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period (i.e., [ADDRESS_597607] dose of study treatment ) will be followed up 
to resolution.  Resolution means that the subject h as returned to a baseline state of health , the 
Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE , or the subject 
is lost to follow -up.  For  AEs with a causal relationship to the study treatment , R-Pharm or its 
designee must concur  with the Investigator’s assessment. 
For SAEs, nonserious AESIs , and pregnancies, R -Pharm’s designee may follow  up by 
[CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and 
outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, or autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.

SAE until the event has resolved to the baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_737], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent .  
If the subject is lost to follow -up, the SAE will  be categorized based on the Investigator’s last 
assessment .  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be related to OKZ 
or study -related procedures until an outcome can be reported.  
During the study, resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the SAE page of 
the eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification .  If, after 
follow -up, return to the baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation 
should be recorded on the S AE page of the eCRF.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
7.4.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all 
time points throughout the study .  The Investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory 
values .  If the Investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current diagnosis  (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible)  and is not a clinically 
significant worsening from the baseline laboratory parameter , it should be documented 
accordingly without being reported as a separate laboratory  AE.  The central laboratory will

7.4.9 Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire s 
The questionnaire s “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire  for Screening Visit ” and “Tuberculosis 
Risk Questionnaire for Post -Screeni ng Visits”  (see Appendix 5 [ Section  13.5] ) should be 
used as source document s.  The questionnaire “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for 
Screening Vis it” will be completed at Visit 1 ( Screening ), and the questionnaire 
“Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for Post -Screening Visits” will be completed at Visits  7, 
10, 15, and  SFU -2 as noted in Table 1.  
At the Screening Visit, if question No. 1 ( Does the subject have a currently active TB disease 
or a history of active TB disease) or question No. 2 (Has the subject been in close contact 
[i.e., sharing the same household or other enclosed environment , such as a social gathering 
place, workplace, or facility, for extended periods during the day ] with an individual with 
active TB  within the past 1.5 years ) of the questionnaire “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire 
for Screening Visit” is answered “Yes”, the subject  is not allowed to enter the study  (see 
exclusion criterion No. 19, Section 5.3.2).   A “Yes” response to any of the other questions 
within the questionnaire at Screening should trigger further careful assessment to determine the subject’s risk of TB disease.  
At all post -Screening visits , a “Yes” response on the “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for 
Post-Screening Visits” should be treated as follows:  
• Question 1:  If a subject answers “Yes” study treatment should be discontinued if active 
TB is confirmed (see Section  6.11).  
• Questions 2 through 6:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, they should be 
assessed (TB risk questionnaire and physical examination) [ADDRESS_597611], if needed.  
• Questions 7 through 12:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, this should trigger a 
careful assessment to determine if the subject developed TB (see Section  7.4.10).  
This risk questionnaire s are not to be used to exclude TB disease or confirm diagnosis.

According to the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (CPMP/International Council 
for Harmonisation [ICH]/135/95), R -Pharm and R -Pharm ’s designee  are responsible for 
implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with written 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling.  
The following steps will be taken to ensure t he accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
• Investigator meetings  
• Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters  
• Study s ite initiation visit 
• Early study site visits after enrollment  
• Routine study site monitoring  
• Ongoing st udy site communication and training 
• Data management quality control checks  
• Continuous data acquisition and cleaning 
• Internal review of data  
• Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, R -Pharm’s (or designee’s) Clinical Quality Ass urance Department may conduct 
periodic audits of the study processes, including study site, study site visits, central 
laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and final clinical study report .  When audits are 
conducted, access must be authorized for all study -related documents including medical 
history and concomitant medication documentation to R -Pharm ’s designee and regulatory 
authorities.  
8.1 Monitoring  
R-Pharm ’s designee will perform all monitoring functions within this clinical study.  The 
designee’s monitors will work in accordance with established  SOPs and have the same rights 
and responsibilities as monitors from R -Pharm .  Monitors will establish and maintain regular

During monitoring visits, entries in the eCRFs will be compared with the original source 
documents (source data verification) .  Please refer to the Monitoring Plan for further details . 
Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the Data Management and Biostatistics departments of R -Pharm ’s designee . 
An EDC system will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF data will be entered in electronic forms at the study site .  Data collection will be completed by [CONTACT_386615] .  Appropriate training and securit y measures will be 
completed with the Investigator and all authorized study site staff prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any study subjects.  
All data must be entered in English .  The eCRFs should always refle ct the latest observations 
on the subjects participating in the study .  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible during or after the subject’s visit .  To avoid interobserver variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the sa me individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and safety evaluations .  The Investigator must verify 
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct .  If some assessments are not done, 
or if certain informatio n is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator 
should indicate this in the eCRF .  The Investigator will be required to electronically sign off 
on the clinical data .

The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no 
discrepancies between critical data.  A ll entries, corrections , and alterations are to be made by 
[CONTACT_386616]/her designee .  The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs .  
Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the 
data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_218817], together w ith time and date will be logged .  Roles and rights of 
the study site staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in advance .  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data Manager 
will raise a query in the EDC application.  T he appropriate study site staff will answer 
queries sent to the Investigator .  This will be audit trailed by [CONTACT_386617], time , and date stamp are captured.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified.  S ource documents are all documents 
used by [CONTACT_192162][INVESTIGATOR_5182]’s medical history, t hat verify the 
existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria , and all records covering the 
subject’s participation in the study .  They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The I nvestigator is responsible for maintaining source documents .  These will be made 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_83798].  T he Investigator must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives study treatment, regardless of 
duration.  A ll supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], should be clearly identified with the study and subject number .  Any 
personal information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.  
Electronic case report form records will be automatically appended with the identification of the creator, by [CONTACT_5248] .  Specified records will be electronically signed 
by [CONTACT_83796]/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data 
are accurate.  T his will be facilitated by [CONTACT_132158]’s unique User ID and 
password; date and time stamps will be added automatically at  the time of electronic 
signature .  If an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be made in 
accordance with the relevant software procedures .  All changes will be fully recorded in a 
protected audit trail, and a reason for the change will be required.  
Adverse events and med ical history will be coded using  the most recent version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) .  Concomitant medications will be 
coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO DDE).

Amendment 2.1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_597615] 1  of the 2 OKZ dose regimens  
is shown to be efficacious and that a priori both OKZ dose regimens are assumed to be 
efficacious, disjunctive power (i.e., a probability of detecting a significant treatment effect 
for at least 1  OKZ treatment regimen) will be used as a criterion for the estimation of the 
sample size . 
Sample size requirements are calculated to provide sufficient disjunctive power to evaluate the primary endpoint (superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to the ACR20 response rate at Week 12 ) as well as 3 secondary endpoints ( noninferiority  of OKZ relative 
to adalimumab with respect to the ACR20 response rate at Week 12, superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to the proportion of subjects with DAS28 ( CRP ) <3.[ADDRESS_597616] to the proportion of 
subjects with DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 at Week 12).  
Sample size was estimated taking into account a multiplicity control procedure and the 
resulting α  adjustment that will be used in this study to control an overall Type  I error rate in 
the strong sense at a 1 -sided α  = 0.025 across the primary and secondar y endpoints.  More 
specifically, the α-control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the 
tests related to each of the 2  OKZ dose regimens (i.e., using the 1- sided α = 0.0125 for each 
dose).  A gate -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_466026], with a fixed order of hypothesis tests for the primary and secondary endpoints within each OKZ dose regimen.

this endpoint in a fixed order of testing as per the gate- keepi[INVESTIGATOR_466027].  
Treatment effect assumptions used in the simulation -based sample size calculations involving 
the primary and the 2 selected secondary  endpoint s are as follows.  
The ACR20 response rate at Week  12 for the placebo group is estimated to be 2 5% in t his 
study population ( Genovese et al, 2008; Keystone et al, 2004; Weinblatt et al, 2003) .  The 
OKZ ACR20  response rates for the [ADDRESS_597621] 50 % and 55% , respectively, resulting in an expected difference in 
ACR20  response rates of [ADDRESS_597622] 52.5% at Week  12.  A 
noninferiority  margin of 12% is used for the comparison between OKZ and ada limumab  with 
respect to this endpoint . 
The DAS28  low disease activity (based on DAS28  [CRP] <3.2) response rate at Week  12 is 
estimated to be 10% in the placebo group ( van der Heijde et al, 2006) and 2 2% and 30% in 
the [ADDRESS_597623] 27% 
at Week 12.  A noninferiority margin of 7.5% is used for the comparison between OKZ and 
adalimumab with respect to this endpoint . 
The references cited above for ACR20 and DAS28 response rates are assumed to reflect 
approximately 10% of subjects discontinuing randomized treatment prior to Week 12.  In this study, subjects who discontinue prior to Week [ADDRESS_597624] to the proportion of subjects with DAS28 (CRP) <3.2  at 
Week  12.  Details regarding subjects who discontinue treatment and/or study participation

Based on the treatment effect assumptions and the methodology for estimating sample size 
via simulation to ensure sufficient disjunctive power as described above, a sample size of 1575 subjects randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio (450, 450, 450, and 225 subjects  per group, 
respectively) will yield 100% disjunctive power for testing the primary hypothesis (superiority of OKZ to placebo with respect to ACR20 at Week  12), 92% disjunctive power 
for testing the secondary hypothesis of noninferiority  of OKZ to adalimum ab with respect to 
ACR20 rate at Week 12, 92% disjunctive power for the evaluation of the secondary endpoint of superiority of OKZ to placebo with respect to DAS28 (CRP)  <3.2 at Week 12, and 88% 
disjunctive power for testing the secondary hypothesis of noninferiority of OKZ to 
adalimumab with respect to DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 at Week 12.

rate at Week 12 . 
The overall Type I error rate will be controlled for testing hypotheses of the primary a nd 
secondary endpoints at the overall 1- sided α = 0.025. 
The following hypothesis tests will be included in the multiplicity control procedure :  
superiority of each OKZ group versus placebo for the primary endpoint (ACR20 response 
rate at Week 12 ), noninfe riority  of each OKZ group  versus adalimumab for the secondary 
endpoint (ACR20 response rate at Week 12), superiority of each OKZ group versus placebo 
for the secondary endpoint DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at Week 12, noninferiority of each OKZ group ver sus adalimumab for the secondary endpoint DAS28 (CRP) 
<3.2 response rate at Week 12, and  superiority of each OKZ group versus placebo for the 
remaining 3 secondary endpoints  (HAQ- DI improvement at Week 12, ACR50 at Week 24, 
and C DAI ≤ 2.8 at Week  24).  The test for assay sensitivity (superiority of adalimumab versus 
placebo with respect to ACR20  and DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at Week 12) is not 
included in the multiplicity control strategy due to the ancillary nature of this test and will be carried out using a 1 -sided α  = 0.[ADDRESS_597631] for noninferiority  of OKZ 
versus adalimumab.  
The α-control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related 
to each of the 2  OKZ dose  regimen s versus placebo (i.e., using the 1 -sided α = 0.0125 for 
each dose) .  A gate-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_466028] .  In other words, each OKZ dose regimen 
will be tested at 1- sided α = 0.0125 for a given endpoint if null hypotheses are rejected at 
1-sided α  = 0.0125 for this dosing regimen for all previous endpoints based on the 
established order .  Conversely, the testing will stop for a given OKZ dose regimen at the 
endpoint for which the null hypothesis is accepted at 1- sided α  = 0.0125.  
The above multiplicity control procedure will be applied to the primary analysis of the primary and seconda ry efficacy endpoints  based on the ITT population, and will not be 
applied to the sensitivity analyses of these endpoints. 
9.4.7 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response 
and remaining on ra ndomized treatment and in the study at Week  12, analyzed using the ITT 
population as the primary efficacy analysis .  Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint will 
also be done using the mITT, if sufficiently different from the ITT population, and PP populations.

adalimumab and a more conservative minimum lower bound of 43% for OKZ is considered 
to be clinically meaningful.  As a result, we use a noninferiority  margin of 12%  for the 
ACR20 response rate at Week 12 . 
In a meta- analysis of 2 clinical studies of adalimumab  (Keystone et al, 2013 ; Taylor  et al,

adalimumab+MTX (N=537) and placebo+MTX (N=688) was equal to 20% (95% confidence 
interval:  15.3% to 24.6%).  Therefore, 15.3%  is the absolute largest noninferiority margin 
that could be justified.  Using an assumption of 27% for DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response rate at 
Week 12 for adalimumab and a more conservative minimum lower bound of 19.5% for OKZ 
is considered to be clinically mea ningful.  As a result, we use a noninferiority margin of

1987) .  Imputed values will be sampled from a posterior Bayesian distribution of the baseline 
values of each continuous parameter (for all treatment groups combined) using a regression 
imputation model with age, sex, time from RA diagnosis to first study dose, and duration of 
prior MTX treatment as predictor variables .  Multiply imputed data will be analyzed with an 
ANCOVA model and the results will be combined using the Rubin’s rule ( Rubin, 1987) .  
Additional details will be provided in the SAP. 
Intermediate Missing Data  
Missing data may also result from missed intermediate visits for subjects who completed the 
study .  For all binary endpoints, missing intermediate res ponder status will be imputed from 
the surrounding visits .  If the status at visits both before and after the missed visit is classified 
as responder, the subject will be considered a responder at the missed visit .  Otherwise, the 
subject will be considere d a nonresponder .  If an assessment for a given binary endpoint at 
the last visit is missing for a completing subject, data from the 2  previous visits will be used 
with the same logic for determining the response status .  For the ACR20/50/[ADDRESS_597639] as a responder, the responder category will be used.  O therwise, 
the method based on surrounding visits as described above will be applied.   Similarly, for all 
continuous endpoints, an average of values from the surrounding visits will be imputed for the missing visit.

based on the criteria of achieving the corresponding clinical response (e.g., ACR20) using all 
data collected at the time point of interest, i.e., including data collected after  premature 
discontinuation of randomized treatment .  Subjects who discontinue from the s tudy overall 
will be considered nonresponders  at time points after study discontinuation.  
For the supportive analysis of continuous endpoints, data collected after premature 
discontinuation of randomized treatment will be excluded and replaced with values imputed 
based on the return to baseline approach implemented with MI as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
These supportive analyses will be performed for all efficacy  endpoints . 
Sensitivity to Mis sing Data Assumptions   
The method of handling missing data that considers discontinued subjects as nonresponders  
or imputes continuous data with baseline values may be regarded as not conservative if the 
proportion of subjects droppi[INVESTIGATOR_466030] .  Similarly, this method may be considered not conservative 
for testing noninferiority  of OKZ to adalimumab if the proportion of subjects discontinuing is 
greater in the adalimumab group than in the OKZ treatment groups .  Moreover, considering 
all discontinued subjects as nonresponders  may bias the analy sis towards similarity between 
adalimumab and OKZ in the context of noninferiority  testing, even if the proportions of 
discontinued subjects are similar in the compared treatment groups .  To address the 
possibility of these scenarios , 2 alternative strateg ies will be used :  [ADDRESS_597641] the analyses intended to demonstrate superiority of OKZ to placebo, analys is of 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be repeated using all collected data (including data after  premature study treatment discontinuation) but with missing data after study 
withdrawal  imputed under the following assumptions .  Missing post study withdrawal data for 
subjects discontinuing from the placebo group will be imputed under the assumption of the 
missing -at-random ( MAR ) mechanism, where these discontinued subjects are assumed to

taking into account their values observed prior to discontinuation.  F or subjects discontinuing 
from the OKZ treatment groups , missing postwithdrawal data will be imputed from the same 
MAR -based imputation model estimate d from the placebo subjects, assuming that after 
discontinuation, the OKZ subjects will drift towards the mean response of the placebo group.  
This approach is likely to result in more favorable imputations for the placebo group 
compared with the nonresponder/return to baseline assumption, while for the OKZ treatment groups , it will not assume a treatment effect beyond the study effect and the effect of the 
background MTX therapy .  This approach will be more conservative compared with  the 
primary analysis i f the proportion of subjects discontinuing from the study  is greater in the 
placebo group than in the OKZ treatment groups . 
This approach will be implemented with MI  using [ADDRESS_597643], intermediate missing data 
of each continuous parameter will be mult iply imputed under the MAR assumption within 
each treatment group using a multivariate normal imputation model and the Markov chain 
Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) method.  S econd, intermediate missing d ata imputed in this way will 
then be used together with observed data for the estimation of the MAR -based model from 
the placebo group, which will be done using sequential regression imputation models applied 
to each continuous parameter  (Ratitch  et al, 2013 ).  The MAR -based placebo imput ation 
model for each parameter will be estimated based on data from placebo subjects and will include baseline value of the corresponding parameter and all postbaseline values prior to 
study discontinuation as explanatory variables .  Poststudy discontinuat ion missing values in

For the secondary endpoint that measures physical ability based on the HAQ -DI 
improvement at Week 12 , a continuous responder analysis will also be perform ed.  Subjects 
will be considered responders at a specified improvement threshold if they experience a 
percent age improvement in the HAQ -DI score from baseline to Week 12 that is greater or 
equal to the specified threshold and if they remain on the randomized treatment and in the 
study through Week 12.  T his analysis will be performed for a range of improvement 
thresholds from 0%  to 100% in 5% increments .  The results will summarized using a graph 
of proportion of responders in each treatment group versus improvement thresholds. 
Sensitivity Analysis for Testing Noninferiority  of OKZ to Adalimumab  
To stress- test the analysis of noninferiority  of OKZ to adalimumab with regards  to the 
ACR20 and DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 rates  at Week 12, data at time points after  premature 
withdrawal from the study will be imputed based on the MAR assumption.  Subjects imputed 
under the MAR assumption within their treatment group will follow the distribu tion of 
responses in their respective treatment groups  and will not be biased towards similarity 
between the compared treatment groups . 
This approach will be implemented with MI  applied to each continuous parameter that is 
involved in the definition of the ACR20 and DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response s.  Data collected 
after premature discontinuation of randomized treatment through Week 12 will be included 
in this analysis.  Intermediate a nd monotone missing data of each involved continuous 
parameter will be multiply imputed under the MAR assumption within each treatment group 
using a multivariate normal imputation model and the MCMC method . 
The binary ACR20 and DAS28 (CRP) <3.2 response va riable s at Week 1 2 will then be 
computed from the multiply imputed data for all subjects .  Multiply imputed datasets will be 
analyzed using the same method as in the primary analysis, followed by [CONTACT_466065]’s rule ( Rubin, 1987).

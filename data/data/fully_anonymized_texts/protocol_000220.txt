LY2951742 1.Synopsis
Title of Study:
A Phase 3b M ulticenter, Single -Arm, Open -Label Safety Study of LY2951742
(galcanezumab) in Patients with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_298938] :
Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal  antibody  that select ively binds to and neutralizes 
calcitonin gene -related pepti de(CGRP) that has been ident ified for clinical development in pain 
condi tions relevant to the CGRP pathway  such as migraine and cluster headache . The 
similarit ies between mig raine and cluster headache, the role of CGRP in both disorders ,and the 
clinical efficacy  observed wi th galcanezumab to date for the prevent ive treatment of migraine 
support the evaluat ion of galcanezumab for the treatment of cluster headache.
The aim of t his study  is to assess the long -term safety  and tol erabili ty of galcanezumab [ADDRESS_364784] 
completed Study  I5Q-MC-CGAL (CGAL) or Study  I5Q-MC-CGAM (CGAM) .
Objective(s)/Endpoints:
The primary  object ive of this study  is to eval uate the safet y of open -label galcanezumab within 
the context of expected medical pract ice in eligible patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_298939]. Safet y will be assessed using treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), s erious 
adverse events (SAEs), as well as suicidal ideation and behaviors utilizing the Columbia -Suicide 
Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS).
Summary of Study Design:
Briefly,Study I5Q-MC-CGAR (CGAR) is aPhase [ADDRESS_364785] of 2study  phases (SP): SPI [INVESTIGATOR_298940] p hase to confirm patients m eet the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria, and SPII is the 
open -label treatment p hase during which pat ients can receive galcanezumab 300 m g
administered subcutaneously (SC) up to once a m onth.  Wit hin the paradigm of a once -monthly 
dosing regimen , the decisi onto dose at each monthly  interval will be determined by  [CONTACT_1275].
Treatment Arms and Duration:
One treatm ent arm : galcanezumab [ADDRESS_364786] igator based on clinical symptoms and respons e.
Number of Patients :
This is an open -label safet y study  forpatients who previously enrolled in and co mpleted Study 
CGAL or Study CGAM.  Therefore, the sample size is determined by [CONTACT_298950] .

3.2. Background
Cluster headache is a rare but disabling primary  headache disorder characterized by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_298941], conj unctival injecti on, and nasal  congesti on (Internat ional Classification o f 
Headache Disorders, Thirdedition, beta versi on[ICHD -3 2013 ]).  The di agnosis of cluster 
headache is distinctly recognized and defined ICHD -3 (2013).
There are significant unmet needs for just about every  clinical  aspect of the pati ent wi th cluster 
headache, particularly related to the severit y of the disease and treatment options.  The majorit y 
of patients experi encing cluster headache attacks rate thei r pain intensit y as near to or at the 
worst pain imaginable (using a Visual Analog Scale [VAS ] 10-cm scale; Torelli and Manzoni 
2003). Regarding treatment options, two main treatment modalit ies are ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_153794] :  
acute/abortive treatmen ts (used at the onset of individual cluster headache attacks to abort the 
attack) and prophylact ic/prevent ive treatments (aimed to reduce cluster headache attack 
frequency ).  In the [LOCATION_002], there areno approved preventive medicat ions.
Calcitonin gene-related pepti de is a [ADDRESS_364795] abundant pepti des wi thin the nervous system (McCarthy  and Lawson 1990), and is 
highly  expressed in tri geminal  gangli on neurons.  The association of CGRP with cluster 
headache was demo nstrated in [ADDRESS_364796] elevated CGRP levels co mpared to controls 
(Edvinsson and Goadsby 1994 ; Fanciullacci et al.1995; Fanciullacci et al. 1997 ).  The elevated 
CGRP l evels were normalized after successful treatment with SC sumatri ptan,oxygen 
inhalat ion,or spon taneous recovery .
Galcanezumab is a humanized mo noclonal  antibody  that select ively binds to and neutralizes 
CGRP .  Galcanezumab has been identified for clinical development in pain condit ions rel evant 
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364797]  such as migraine ;and in completed studies to date, galcanezumab was 
shown to al ter pl asma CGRP concentrations, which is consistent wi th the binding o f the ant ibody  
(galcanezumab ) to CGRP (Invest igator’s Brochure [ IB]Section 3.1) .
To date, more than [ADDRESS_364798] 
been exposed to galcanezumab at single doses up to 600 m g and multiple doses up to 300 mg in 
5clinical trials of galcanezumab . In studies of pat ients with migraine (Studies I5Q -MC-ART1 
[ART -01] and I5Q -MC-CGAB [CGAB]), efficacy data have demonstra ted that galcanezumab
had significant ly greater mean reductions than placebo in migraine headache days and other 
efficacy  parameters. Across clinical studies of galcanezumab ,assessment of TEAEs indicates 
that galcanezumab has been well tolerated in both healt hy subjects and in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c 
migraine. The AEs generally have been mild to moderate in severit y. In the com pleted studies 
of patients wi th migraine, the m ost frequent lyreported TEAEs in either study included inject ion-
site pain, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826], abdominal pain, dizziness, inject ion-site ery thema, 
rash, hypertensio n, and nasopharyngit is. Analyses of laboratory  values and cardi ovascular 
monitoring of the clinical studies have shown no clinically  important changes in te sted 
param eters (IB Section 3.2) .
3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs
of galcanezumab may be found in the IB.  Inform ation on AEs expected to be related to the 
investigat ional product may be found in Sect ion 7 (Development Core Safet y Inform ation)of the 
IB.  Informat ion on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and 
that will be assessed by [CONTACT_298951] , may 
be found in Sect ion 6 (Effects in Humans) of the IB.

LY2951742 Study P hase I:SPI [INVESTIGATOR_298943] p hase. Patients will sign an informed consent document 
prior to com pleting any study -related screening procedures. SPI[INVESTIGATOR_298944] (V)[ADDRESS_364801] procedure of the screening assessment for the patient is completed.   Once Study  
CGAR is open for enrollment, potentially eligible p atients may enter screening directly from the 
parent study , CGAL or CGAM .  If a patient i s not experiencing cluster headache attacks (e.g., in 
remission) they  may wai t to enter screening for CGAR unt il they ant icipate experiencing or are 
experiencing a cluster headache attack.   If patients hadcompleted the parent study ,CGAL or 
CGAM ,prior to Study  CGAR being open for enrollment, potentially eligible pat ients may still 
enter screening for Study  CGAR .Study  procedures for V1 (Event List A) of Study  CGAR will 
be co mpleted as fo llows:
If the last visit of the parent study  is also the first visit of Study  CGAR, then 
electrocardi ogram s (ECGs) , vitals, wei ght, hem atology, clinical chemistry , urinalysis, 
hemoglo bin A1C (HbA1C),and serum  pregnancy, C -SSRS, and Self-Harm  Supplement 
Form /Self-Harm  Follow-up Form  (SHSF /SHFU )from the last visi t of the parent study  
will also be used for the first visit of Study  CGAR .
If the last visi t of the parent study  is ≤2 weeks from V1 o f Study  CGAR , the hematol ogy, 
chemistry , HbA1C, and urinalysis do not need to be repeated .
If the last visi t of the par ent study  is >[ADDRESS_364802] visit of Study  CGAR .
Note:  After V1, i f V2 does not occur wi thin 3 m onths of V1 (e.g., patient enters V1 in 
remission), prior to V2 an ECG, hematology, clinical chemistry , urinalysis, urine drug screen 
(UDS ), HbA 1C, and serum pregnancy  must be collected and e ligibilit yconfirmed pri or to dosin g
at V2 (see footnote “d”in the SOA) .
Study P hase II:SPII is the single -arm open -label treatm ent phase during which pat ients can 
receive galcanezumab [ADDRESS_364803] a scheduled tele
phone visit (V3) with the patient 
approximately  
1week after the first invest igational product administration to collect 
spontaneously reported AEs.
Every  month, the decisio n whether to administer a mo nthly dose will be based upon the study  
investigator’s judgment , which is not limited to, but includes assessment of the patient’s clinical 
symptoms and response as fo llows:
Dosing isup to once monthly ;more frequent dosing is not allowed.  The full 300 mg 
dose i s to be administered, changing the dose amount is not allowed. 
If the patient remits and dosing is halted, the patient may remain in the study , but they  
shoul d have an office visit [ADDRESS_364804] dose to com plete the proc edures listed in 
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364805] F(Table 2.1).Dosing in this scenario may be reinit iated at the study  
investigator’s discret ion.
Mont hly telephone visits shoul d be com pleted for pati ents who are not being dosed ,but 
remain in the study  (e.g., in remissio n).
If dosing is temporarily  interrupted due to a potential safet y concern, dosing may be re-
initiated at the study  invest igator’s discret ion following a discussion and agreement 
between the study  invest igator and Lilly Medical that re -initiation of dosing is 
appropriate.
oAt the office visit prior to re-initiation of dosing the following procedures:  
ECG, immunogenicit y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , 
HbA1c and urine pregnancy  are to be collected .  The urine pregnancy must be 
negat ive and the ECG should be evaluated for safety prior to dosing.  
5.2. Number of Participants
Only patie nts who previously enrolled in and co mpleted Study CGAL or Study  CGAM are 
eligible for this study .  Therefore, the maximum number of eligible partici pants is determined by  
[CONTACT_298953].
5.3. End of Study Definition
The study  will continue in a specific regio n until any oneof the f ollowing criteria is met:
Sponsor decisio n
Nonapproval fro m a regul atory  agency in the country /region in which the patient is 
enrolled
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Please r efer to Secti on 3.1for further informat ion.
5.5. Justification for Dose
The dose level proposed for the study  of galcanezumab in cluster headache is 30 0 mg 
administered once monthly . Based on inhibit ion of capsaicin- induced dermal blood flow 
(CIDBF) and pharmacokinet ic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of plasma CGRP 
concentrations (target engagement) from prior studies, it is presumed that this dose reg imen will 
provi de a high degree of pharmaco logical act ivity (greater than 90% effect ive in inhibit ing 
CIDBF ; about 90% decrease from baseline in unbound plasma CGRP concentrations ), and be 
sufficient to test the effect iveness of galcanezumab for the treatm ent of cl uster headache. A dose 
of [ADDRESS_364806] on 
CIDBF and unbound plasma CGRP as 150 mg every  2 weeks ( Q2W ), which yielded evidence of 
efficacy  in migraine (Study  ART-01). The safet y and tol erabilit y of galcanezumab supports 
dosing at 300 mg once m onthly .  Addit ionally , the parent tri als, Study CGAL and Study  CGAM ,
utilized galcanezumab 300mg once monthly dosing.
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364807] occur between the sponsor clinical 
research physician ( CRP )and the invest igator to determine if the pat ient may  
be considered for 
Study  CGAR .  If both agree i t is medically  appropri ate for the pati ent to be considered for Study  
CGAR, the decisio n must be docum ented by  [CONTACT_17062] .
All patients must meet the fo llowing select ion criteria.  Eligibilit y of patients for study  
enrollment will be based on medical history , physical  examinat ion, clinical laboratory  tests, 
ECG, and the inclusio n and exclusio n criteria described below.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen fa ilure) m ay be 
considered for rescreen once, for selected cri teria, wi th approval  from Eli Lilly and Co mpany 
(hereafter Lilly )Medical (see below).
Prospective approval o f protocol  deviati ons to enrollment cri teria, also known as protocol 
waivers or exempt ions, are not permitted.
6.1. Inclusion Criteria

8.1.2. Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled
If the sponsor or invest igator ident ify a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, a discussio n must occur between the sponsor CRP and the invest igator to 
determine if the pat ient may  cont inue in the study .  If both agree i t is medically  appropriate to 
continue, the invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the sponsor CRP to allow the 
inadvertent ly enro lled pat ient to conti nue in the study  with or wi thout treatm ent wi th 
investigat ional product.
8.2. Discontinuation from the Study
All patients may cont inue in the study  and receive treatm ent wi th galcanezumab based on the 
study  invest igator’s judgment of clinical symptoms and response until the end of the study  
(described in Sect ion5.3). In addit ion, the study investigator should c onsider study  
discontinuat ionfor an individual patient for the fo llowing:
Lack of benefit. The study  physician shoul d consider whether the patient is 
deriving benefit fro m galcanezumab .
Safety concerns, including evaluation o f overall risk -benefit .
The i nvest igator decides that the patient should be discontinued fro m the study  for 
another reason .
Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigational product or 
enrollment in any other type o f medical research judged not to be scient ifically or 
medically co mpat ible with this study.
Participation in the study  needs to be stopped for medical, safet y, regul atory , or 
other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and good clinical 
practi ce (GCP ).

Patients who discont inue from the study early will have end-of-therapy  procedures perform ed as 
shown in Event Li st Finthe Schedule of Act ivities(Table 2.1).
8.3. Lost to Follow -Up
A pat ient willbe considered lost to fo llow-up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and 
is unable to be contact[CONTACT_17066].  Si te personnel are expected to make diligent attempts 
to con tact pati ents who fail to return for a scheduled visit or were otherwise unable to be 
followed up by  [CONTACT_4179]. Diligent attempts will be defined in the Protocol Operati onsManual .
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364828] results.  Certain samples may 
be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or 
laboratory  certificati on standards.
9.1. Efficacy Asse ssments
The Patient Gl obal Impressi on of Improvement (PGI -I)requests patients to mark the box that 
best describes y our cl uster headache condit ion since y ou started taking this medicine.  The 
options in the displayed boxes are represented on a seven -point scale, with 1=very much better 
and 7=very  much worse (Guy  1976).
9.1.1. Appropriateness of Assessments
All efficacy and safet y assessments have been well documented and are generally  regarded as
reliable, accurate, and relevant in this pat ient population .
9.2. Adverse Events
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt h care o ption, 
AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational 
product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before 
completing the study.  The patient should be fo llowed until the event resolves, stabilizes with 
appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained.  The frequency o f follow
-up 
evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator.
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study  is to 
establish treatm enteffect.
After the informed consent form ( ICF) is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the 
occurrence and nature of each patient’s pre -exist ing condi tions, including clinically significant 
signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study .  In addit ion, site personnel  will 
record any  change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs. Invest igators should 
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364829] , study device, or a study procedure, taking into
account the disease, concomitant treatment or pathologies.
A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the 
investigat ional product, study  device and/or study  procedure and the AE.
The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment.
Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a resul t of an AE, study  site personnel  
must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading 
to discont inuat ions of treatment.
9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in 1of the following outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  [CONTACT_3170] f or any  other reason:  im portant medical 
events that may  not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298945], based upon appropriate medical judgment.
when a condit ion related to the disposable manual prefill ed syringe necessitates 
medical or surgical intervent ion to precl ude ei ther perm anent impairment of a 
body  function or perm anent dam age to a body  structure, the seri ous outcom e of 
“required intervent ion” will be assigned.
Although all AEs occurring after s igning the ICF are recorded in the eCRF, SAE reporting 
begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product.  However, if 
an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, it needs to be 
reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study  procedure.
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of  any SAE within [ADDRESS_364830] igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If alerts are issued via telephone, they  
are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official  notificati on on study -specific SAE forms.  This 
24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow -up SAE 
inform ation.
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page 33
LY2951742 Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal e xposure to invest igational product) does not meet the 
definit ion of an AE.  However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be 
reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus.   
Pregnancy cases sh ould be reported up to [ADDRESS_364831] 
discontinued and/or completed the study  (the patient summary eCRF has been com pleted) .  
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has 
been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably  possibly  related to the 
study  treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igatormust prom ptly notify Lilly .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure.  
[LOCATION_002] 21 CFR 312.32 and European Commissio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC
([LOCATION_002] Government Publishing Office [WWW]; European Commissio n [WWW]) and the 
associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory  requirements i n parti cipat ing countries 
requi re the reporting of S [LOCATION_003]Rs.  Lilly  has procedures that will be followed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated 
detailed guidances.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Moni toring with the 
Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale, Self -Harm Supplement Form, and Self -Harm Follow -up Form
The C -SSRS and SHSF will be administered to assess and evaluate patients for suicide -related 
events (behavior and/or ideat ion) at every  scheduled and unscheduled office visit as specified in 
the Schedule of Activities(Table 2.1).  Before administering the C -SSRS (Posner et al. 2011), 
study  site personnel will questi on the patient about any  change in the pre -exist ing condit ion(s) 
and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.   Nonserious AEs obtained through the questionnaire 
are recorded and analyzed separately .  Only serious AEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion 
elicited through the C -SSRS are to be recorded as AEs via eCRF. Serious adverse events must 
be reported to Lilly or its desi gnee wi thin24hours as SAEs.   The SHSF captures the number of 
discrete events of suicidal behavior, possible suicidal behavior, or nonsuicidal self -injuri ous 
behavior recorded in the C -SSRS and must be completed at every visit.  Addit ionally, t he SHFU 
will be co mpleted at any  visit, including screening/baseline visits, when a suicidal or nonsuicidal 
self-injuri ous behavior is ident ified.  At any time during the study , if a pati ent is considered to be 
at significant ri sk for sui cide by [CONTACT_3170], prompt referral of the patient to a mental healt h 
professio nalshoul d be considered .
9.2.2. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study  parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to 
facilitate process and product improvements.

(Table 2.1)as single ECGs for overread.  Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_364833] ion.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patientis still present, to determine whether the subject meets entry criteria a nd for immediate 
subject management, should any  clinically rel evant findings be i dentified .Electrocardi ograms 
may be obtained at additional t imes, when deemed clinically necessary.
Electrocardiograms will have a central overread .  The invest igator (or qualified designee) must 
docum ent his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion, the final overread ECG 
report i ssued by [CONTACT_81131] , and any alert reports .
9.4.2. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and pulse will be collected in triplicate according to the Schedule of Activit ies (
Table 2.1)and at unscheduled office visits.  All sites will  be provi ded wi th an automated bl ood 
pressure machine wit h several cuff sizes.   
The fo llowing guidelines will be used by [CONTACT_298959] m easuring vital signs:
Blood pressure and pulse must be measured before any blood draws.
Blood p ressure will be measured in sitting posit ion with both feet resting on the 
floor after the patient has rested for at least 5 minutes.
Blood pressure will be measured wit h a cuff that is appropriate to the size of the 
patient.
Use the same arm for blood pre ssure collect ion throughout the study .
Arm with cuff must be supported at approximately the heart level .

after the patientreceives the first dose of invest igatio nal product should be reported to Lilly or its 
designee as an AE via eCRF .
9.4.4. Safety Monitoring
Lilly will pe riodically  review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study  by [CONTACT_82393].
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by [CONTACT_17069].  The Lilly 
CRP/ clinical research scientist ( CRS )will, as is appropriate, consult with the f unctionally  
independent Global Pat ient Safety  therapeut ic area physician or clinical scient ist, and 
periodically  revie w:
trends in safety data
laboratory  analy tes
AEs including monitoring of inject ion site reactions, allergic react ions, and 
infect ions
If a study  patient/subject experiences elevated ALT 3×ULN, ALP 2× ULN or elevated 
TBL2×ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by  [CONTACT_3170].  
Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  
test abnorm alities.  To ensure patient/subject safety  and com ply wi th regul atory guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the Lilly designated medical mo nitor regarding co llection of 
specific reco mmended clinical informat ion and fo llow
-up laboratory  tests (Appendix 3 ).
9.4.5. Samples for Immunogenicity Research
Where local regulat ions and ethical review boards (ERB) allow, blood samples for 
immunogenicit y testing will  be collected to determine ant ibody  producti on against galcanez umab
as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Table 2.1).Immunogenicit y will be assessed by  a 
validated assay designed to detect anti -drug antibody  (ADAs) in the presence of the 
investigat ional product.  Ant ibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their 
abilit y to neutralize the activit y of the invest igational product. 
Anti
-drug ant ibody  sampling will be init iated immediatel y prior to fi rst pati ent dosing wi th 
galcanezumab (baseline).  Immunogenicit y samples m ust be collected prior to dose 
administration if the visit is a dosing visit , and the timing of all samples will be recorded.
Samples will  also be drawn in the event of early termination or as needed given any  safety  
concerns judged to potentially immuno logically  medi ated.
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY2951742 Samples
Samples will  be drawn at Month 0 (first dose), Month 1, Month 6, and then every 6 months, 
thereafter; prior to dosing unless dosing is tempora rily halted due to a clinical efficacy response.  
When dosing is temporarily  halted due to a clinical efficacy response, an immunogenicit y sample 
is scheduled for [ADDRESS_364834] e is drawn prior to dosing (Section 2, Schedule of Activit ies).  
Addit ionally , at study  terminat ion samples will be drawn approximately [ADDRESS_364835] ivitiesTable 2.1),venous blood samples 
of approximately  
[ADDRESS_364836] patient visit for the study .

the regio n and linguist ically validated.
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY2951742 European Quality of Life Questionnaire 5-Dimensions 5-Levels (EQ- 5D-5L) (EuroQoL 
Group ): A generic, mult idimensio nal, healt h-related, qualit y-of-life instrument that contains 
2parts: a health status profile and a VAS to rate glo bal health-related quali ty of life. The profile 
allows patients to rate their healt h stateon that day with in 5 dom ains, including : mobility, self-
care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressio n (Brooks 1996; Herdman et al.
2011; Stafford et al. 2012).  A single score between 1 and 5is generated for each do mainwith all
5 domains being mapped to a single index through an algorithm (Van Reenen and Janssen 2015
).  
The index ranges between 0 and 1 with the higher score indicat ing a better healt h state perceived 
by [CONTACT_102] .  The VAS provi des an overall pat ient rating of healt h status on that day , witha
range fro m 0 (i.e., “worst imaginable healt h state ”) to 100 (i.e., “best imaginable healt h state ”) 
serving as anchors for the patient’s numeric rating on the hash-marked, vert ical VAS .
The EQ -5D- 5L and cluster headache status data (Section 9.10)will be used to characteri ze 
changes in the heal th status of patient groups . The PGI -I,and other patient characterist icsor 
clinical informat ion may also be used to define specific patient groups associ ated wi th 
EQ-5D- 5L outcomes . 
9.10. Cluster Headache Attack Assessments
The cl uster headache status questions will collect informat ion on the following:  if a pat ient is 
currently in a bout, the duration of the current bout or time since the last bout; and questions 
related to attacks that occurred over a 24 -hour period (i.e., yesterday from midnight to midnight).  
Patients will  be asked to record the number of cluster headache atta cks during that time period, 
inform ation regarding abortive medicat ion use, cluster headache attack duration, and cluster 
headache attack pain severit y will also be recorded.  Pain severit y will be rated using a 5- point 
pain scale, where 0=no pain, 1=mild pain, 2=moderate pain, 3=severe pain, and 4=very  severe 
pain.  Patients should record all cluster attacks regardless of attack duration.

Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as the reported AEs that first occurred or 
worsened during the post -baseline phase compared with the baseline phase .  For each TEAE, the 
severit y level o f the event (mild, moderate, or severe ) will be determined by [CONTACT_298964] 
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364839] ionary for Regul atory  Activities(MedDRA ) Lowest Level Term 
(LLT) will be used in the treatment emergent computation .  For each LLT, the maximum 
severit y at baseline will be used as the baseline severit y.  If the maximum severit y during 
postbaseline is greater than the maximum baseline severit y,the event is considered to be 
treatm ent emergent for the specific post -baseline phase .  For each patient and TEAE, the 
maximum severit y for the MedDRA l evel being displayed (PT, High level Term, or SOC) is the 
maximum post -baseline severit y observed from  all associ ated LLTs m appi[INVESTIGATOR_298946].
For events that are gender -specific, the deno minator and computation of the percentage will 
include only  patients from the given gender.

CGA R(a)
Overview
Protocol  I5Q-MC-CGAR(a), a Phase 3b Mult icenter, Single -Arm, Open Label  Safe ty Study  of 
LY2951742 (galcanezumab) in Patients with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_298949], has been 
amended.  The new protocol is indicated by [CONTACT_61504] (a) and will be used to conduct the study  
in place of any  preceding versio n of the protocol.
The overa ll changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as fo llows:
Revised Exclusio n Cri terion 14a to allow for medical judgment in determining exclusio n 
from Study  CGAR based on abnormal ECG findings in Study  CGAL or Study  CGAM.
Revised Exclus ion Cri terion 14e because intracranial or carotid aneurysm, intracranial 
hemorrhage, and stroke are cardiovascular -related condit ions, whereas intracranial tumor 
and significant head trauma are not cardiovascular related.  Patients with eit her of the 
non-c ardiovascular -related condit ions m entioned here may  be enrolled in the clinical trial 
if upon discussio n with Lilly  Medical i t is judged notto indicate a medical problem that 
woul d preclude study  parti cipat ion(see Exclusio n Cri terion15d).   Thi s revisi on aligns 
Study  CGAR wi th Study  CGAL and Study  CGAM .
Revised Exclusio n Cri terion 14 f to allow for medical judgment in determining exclusio n 
from CGAR based on blood pressure readings in Study  CGAL or Study  CGAM .  This 
revisio n provi des study  investigators with the flexibilit y to em ploy medical judgment in 
determining exclusio n ofpatients wi th inconsistent blood pressure readings during 
participat ion in Study CGAL and Study  CGAM.
Revised Exclusi on Criterion 15c to allow patients who fail eligib ility due to an elevat ion 
of ≥2X ULN for ALT, or ≥1.5X ULN TBL or ALP to be retested.  The patient’s results 
must be discussed and judged not clinically significant by [CONTACT_298966] .  This revision aligns Study  CGAR wi th Study  CGAL and Study  CGAM .
Added Exclusion Criterion 15d to allow for patients with a history  of intracranial tumor 
or head trauma  to be enro lled in Study CGAR based on medical discret ion.  Thi s 
addition aligns Study  CGAR wi th Study  CGAL and Study  CGAM.
Secti on 6.4 was revised to allow for rescreening of patients who fail eligibilit y due to a 
positive UDS.
Revised protocol text in Secti on 3.1, Secti on 5.1,and Section 8.1to clarify  study  
discontinuat ion for those pati ents whose dosing is temporarily interrupted for potential 
safet y concerns .  For these patients, the site investigator in consultat ion with Lilly 
Medical will determine if dosing can resume for the patient whose potential safety
concern iseither ruled out, resolved ,or otherwise treated.  This revisio n will allow 
patients who experience a temporary  or unconfirmed m edical condit ion and would 
otherwi se be discont inued from Study  CGAR to cont inue to receive treatment as long as 
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_364850] igator, in consultation wit h Lilly Medical, determines that it is appropri ate 
to do so.
Minor edi torial changes to correct errors or clarify content were made throughout the 
protocol .

3.[ADDRESS_364851] igator’s judgment of clinical efficacy .  
If, however, the 
investigator stops monthly dosing due to safet y concerns, dosing with galcanezumab should not 
be resumed.
5.1 Overall Design
Study Phase II:   SP II is the single -arm open -label tr eatm ent phase during which pat ients can 
receive galcanezumab [ADDRESS_364852] a scheduled telephone visit (V23) wi th the pati ent 
approximately  1week after the first invest igational product administration to collect 
spontaneously reported AEs.
Every  month, the decisio n whether to administer a mo nthly dose will be based upon the study  
investigator’s judgment, which is not lim ited to, but includes assessment of the patient’s clinical 
symptoms and response as fo llows:
Dosing is up to once monthly; more frequent dosing is not allowed.  The full 300 mg 
dose i s to be administered, changing the dose amount is not allowed. 
If the pa tient remits and dosing is halted, the patient may remain in the study , but they  
shoul d have an office visit [ADDRESS_364853] F ( Table 2.1).  Dosing in this scenario may be re -initiated at the study  
investigator’s discret ion.
I5Q-MC-CGAR (a)Clinical Protocol Page 57
LY2951742 Mont hly telephone visits shoul d be com pleted for pati ents who are not being dosed ,but 
remain in the study  (e.g., in remis sion).
Dosing may be re -initiated at the study  invest igator’s discretion , as long as dosing was 
not halted due to a safet y concern, and should be based upon the patient experiencing a 
cluster headache attack or the ant icipated onset of a cluster headache period/bout, based 
on the patient’s history  (for example, the anticipated onset of a new cluster period in the 
spring based on a patient’s history  of spring -onset cl uster peri ods).  If dosing is 
temporarily interrupted due to a potential safet y concern, dosing may be re -initiated at the 
study  invest igator’s discret ion following a discussion and agreement between the study  
investigator and Lilly Medical that re-initiation of dosing is appropriate .
oAt the office visit prior to re -initiation of dosing the following procedures:  
ECG, immunogenicit y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), hematology , clinical chemistry , 
HbA1c and urine pregnancy are to be collected.  The urine pregnancy must be 
negat ive and the ECG should be evaluated for safety prior to dosing.
If dosing is halted for a  safety reason, the patient should be discontinued (Section 
8.2).

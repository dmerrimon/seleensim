Project Title: Methenamine Hippurate versus Suppressive Antibiotics in the Preventionof Recurrent Urinary Tract InfectionsIntroduction: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infectionsseen in women of all ages across disciplines. Several treatment options are nowavailable for prevention, but the gold standard is considered to be suppressiveantibiotics. Considering increasing antibiotic resistance in treating UTIs, we are lookingfor viable alternatives. There has not yet been a head-to-head comparison of thetreatment options for the last 2 decades.Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that methenamine hippurate will have less or equalrecurrences of UTI’s as suppressive antibiotics and have a lower side effect proﬁle.Literature review:Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections inwomen and account for a signiﬁcant number of ofﬁce and emergency room visits peryear1-2. UTIs can cause vomiting, pain, dysuria, septicemia, fever, fatigues, andoccasionally renal failure in the worst cases. Elderly patients, long-term catheter use, orpatients with renal disease are examples of those at high risk of repeated UTIs, andpatients more likely to have serious complications3. The risk of recurrence has beenshown to be between 20-30% after one infection4. One study by [CONTACT_801330] 44% of women presenting in a primary care setting thathad been treated for UTI within the prior 12 months5.Several methods are available for use in the prevention of recurrent urinary tractinfections (UTIs). One review of management of recurrent UTIs stated that there islacking evidence for cranberry, Vitamin C, and methenamine hippurate and concludedthat antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management1.However, long-term use of antibiotics can lead to resistance, in addition nausea andcandidiasis. Several antibiotics have been used in the prevention of recurrent UTIsincluding most commonly trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin. Trimethoprim can lead toLyell’s syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and pancytopenia. Even at low doses,long-term nitrofurantoin use may result in hepatotoxicity and pneumonitis, althoughusually reversible1.Methenamine hippurate is one such alternative that is currently used in practice. Thelast randomized control trial however comparing methenamine hippurate to suppressiveantibiotics was in 1985. Earlier randomized control trials had promising results showingmethenamine hippurate to be effective without long-term adverse effects. However,these studies had very small populations and did not follow patients for longer than 6months to [ADDRESS_1106115] proﬁle.
Primary Aim(s): Identify if there is a differential impact on prevention of recurrent UTIswhen treated with either trimethoprim or methenamine hippurate in a 6 and 12 monthperiod.Secondary Aim(s):1. Identify adverse reactions of study medications in each group.2. Determine whether or not estrogen has a more additive effect to antibiotics ormethenamine hippurate in post-menopausal women.3. Identify tolerability of the study medications and whether the size of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_801328].Methods:This will be a prospective randomized control trial comparing the efﬁcacy ofmethenamine hippurate versus trimethoprim, a suppressive antibiotic used in theprevention of recurrent UTIs. The deﬁnition of a UTI will include patients who have hadsymptoms including dysuria, suprapubic pain, increased frequency and urgency,malodorous urine, and hematuria plus a positive urine culture with any degree ofbacteriuria.Women with a diagnosis of recurrent UTIs, having had at least two UTIs in the past 6months or [ADDRESS_1106116] not taken it for aminimum of 30 days, will be eligible for enrollment. The patients will be prospectivelyfollowed for one year.After a patient is diagnosed with recurrent UTIs, she will be evaluated with a repeaturine culture to conﬁrm a negative prior to enrollment. Informed consent will then beobtained from the patient by [CONTACT_680923], who will then randomize thepatient to prophylaxis with either methenamine hippurate or trimethoprim. The groupswill be randomized in a 1:1, methenamine hippurate to trimethoprim. The randomizationwill be done by [CONTACT_801331]-generated sequence prior to theinitiation of the study. Randomization will be provided in sequentially-numbered, sealedenvelopes. Because estrogen is a known confounding factor, we will periodically assessthe number of estrogen users in each arm at [ADDRESS_1106117]
to order the speciﬁc medication at the patient’s requested pharmacy. Patients will haveto know which medications they are pi[INVESTIGATOR_801329]. The two medicationsdiffer in frequency and size and would be difﬁcult to blind the patient to. Investigatorsmay choose to crossover to the opposing medication or add it to the patient’s currentregimen if she continues to have recurrences.Inclusion:1. age greater than 18-992. recurrent UTI: at least [ADDRESS_1106118] year (culture positive,any CFU/mL)3. must have been symptomatic with dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain,hematuria, malodorous urine4. treated for last UTI and negative urine culture on entry into study5.

Time to subsequent infection2. Number of patients infection-free after 6-12 months3. Number of infections in 6-12 months per patientSecondary:1. Adverse effects of medications2. Additive effect of estrogen3. Patient tolerability of medicationsSample Size:There are very few prior studies which compared methenamine hippurate totrimethoprim currently published. One randomized control trial from 1982 by[CONTACT_801332], allocated patients with recurrent UTIs to one of 4 groups: placebo,nitrofurantoin 75 mg, methenamine hippurate 1 gm, or trimethoprim 100 mg. Atone year, 63.2% of those in the placebo group had a recurrence, compared to34.2% in the methenamine hippurate group, 25% in the nitrofurantoin group, and10.4% in the trimethoprim group7. In a Cochrane review by [CONTACT_801333], current
prevention strategies were reviewed for the prevention of recurrent UTIs.Prophylactic antibiotics reduced the rate of recurrence to 0.4 UTIs/patient/year. Acrossover study done by [CONTACT_801334] 0.8 UTIs/patient/year using long term methenamine hippurateprophylaxis6. Based on the results of these prior studies, we performed a powerand sample size calculation. It was determined that [ADDRESS_1106119] the expected difference in response with 80% power at a 0.05signiﬁcance level. We predict a 30% attrition rate, and therefore determine thatwe should have 65 subjects per arm.Proposed Analyses:We will determine:1. The time to subsequent UTI recurrence among patients with the diagnosis ofrecurrent UTIs under suppressive therapy with either methenamine hippurateor Trimethoprim. Differences in time to subsequent infection will be comparedand assessed for statistical signiﬁcance using a paired, two-tailed Student’st-test.2. At [ADDRESS_1106120].3. The number of recurrences in each group at 12 month intervals. Wewill determine the rate of recurrences in each arm and compare them using astudent’s t-test.4. The additive effect of estrogen will be determined at [ADDRESS_1106121].References:1. Abdullatif A, Ahmed K, Zaman I, Khan MS, Dasgupta P. Recurrent urinary tractinfections in women.

BACKGROUND:
Clinical need 3 Children with cerebral palsy (CP) frequently experience a downward trend of 
reduced physical activity and worsening gait, leading to a permanent decline or loss in 
ambulatory ability (Fig. 1) [7]. For children with CP, walking is drastically more energetically 
expensive than for their typi[INVESTIGATOR_188310] [8]. Experts have called for new ways to 
elevate activity levels in children with movement disorders [2], [9]. The ankle joint plays a
critical role during walking, acting to stabilize, support, and propel the body [10]. Activation of 
the ankle plantar flexor muscles is reduced, less modulated, and often accompanied by [CONTACT_3252]-
activation of the antagonist dorsiflexor muscles in a majority of individuals with spastic cerebral 
palsy (CP) [11]. Reduced ankle performance during walking in children with CP is suggested as
a primary contributor to the observed gait dysfunction [12]. Ankle plantar-flexors of children with 
CP produce 50% less positive joint work than in typi[INVESTIGATOR_405907] [1], resulting in a reliance on more 
proximally located muscles for forward progression [13]. These muscle activation characteristics 
likely contribute directly or indirectly to reduced energy exchange [14], elevated metabolic cost 
of transport [15], and lower levels of physical activity [16] in this patient population. Evidence 
suggests that addressing or augmenting the neuromuscular deficits at the ankle may allow 
children with CP to engage in greater amounts of habitual physical, which would likely have 
many additional physical and mental health benefits [17], [18].IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

Preliminary Data
RAAD/SPARK Assistance [ADDRESS_511873] treadmill study 
[3], [6], five participants with CP (ages between 5 and 30 years) practiced walking on an 
instrumented treadmill at self-selected speeds with powered plantar-flexion assistance. 
Participants exhibited a 19% reduction (p < 0.05) in net metabolic cost of transport (J kg-1 m-1) 
on average during treadmill walking with assistance compared to their normal (baseline) walkin 
condition. We also found that, compared to baseline, participants had reduced crouch by 14.4 ± 
4° (p < 0.05)
across the lower-extremity and increased in positive ankle power by 43.6 ± 7.4 % (p < 0.05), 
and decrease positive hip power, by 29.2 ± 6.0% (p < 0.01) All of these changes are 
biomechanically favorable.
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405908]-ground training study : 6 individuals with CP (GMFCS I-III (I:3, II:1, III:2), ages 
between 7 and 31 years) completed four consecutive-day over-ground training sessions (89 ± 
16 minutes of assisted walking) and received pre- and post-training assessments [4]. Following 
training, walking speed increased 0.24 m/s (p = 0.006) and stride length increased 0.15 m (p = IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v060120220.002) during unassisted walking, while walking speed increased 0.28 m/s (p = 0.023) and 
stride length increased 0.17 m (p = 0.013) during RAAD-assisted walking. RAAD training 
improved stride-to-stride repeatability of soleus and vastus lateralis muscle activation by [CONTACT_8622] 
49%, while the amount of integrated stance-phase muscle activity was similar across visits and 
conditions. Relative to baseline, post-training walking with the exoskeleton resulted in a soleus 
activity pattern that was 39% more similar to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_405909] (p < 
0.001). In a head-to-head comparison to shod walking on the final visit, the optimized 
assistance level for each participant resulted in a 12.0 ± 4.0% (p=0.012) reduction in metabolic 
cost of transport. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported improvement in over-
ground walking efficiency for individuals with gait impairments.
RAAD/SPARK Resistance Precision Ankle Therapy Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (4-weeks, n = 6) 3 
Participants completed ten, 20-minute training sessions over the course of 4 weeks with 
progressively increasing levels of resistance. Precision resistance led to significantly improved 
(reduced) stance-phase ankle co-contraction (29 ± 13%, p = 0.04), a more normal plantar flexor 
muscle activation profile (30 ± 15%, p = 0.02). We also observed an increase in complexity of 
neural control of walking after training (5 ± 3%, p = 0.04), an improvement that was significantly
greater than those seen with age- and GMFCS-matched controls who had single event multi-
level surgery (SEMLS) or selective dorsal rhizotomies (SDR) (p < 0.01 for both). These 
improvements in neuromuscular control led to a more mechanically-efficient gait pattern (58 ± 
34%, p < 0.05), improved metabolic cost of transport (29 ± 15%, p < 0.05), and enhanced 
performance on tests of functional mobility (11 ± 9%, p = 0.04) and walking endurance (13 ± 
9%, p = 0.05). The rate at which wearable adaptive resistance re-training elicited improved
function was 3 3 6 times greater than what has been reported previously for gait training 
interventions [20], [21].IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

STUDY ENDPOINTS:
Primary Endpoints
÷Safety of the RAAD/SPARK for providing gait training interventions to address mobility 
impairments for children with cerebral palsy. This will be assessed by [CONTACT_405934], including follow-up.
÷Improvement in self-selected gait speed, as measured by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_511874] 
without the device, following 12 sessions of training with the BiOMOTUM RAAD in 
resistance mode, as compared to baseline.
STUDY INTERVENTION(S) / INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT(S):
The RAAD/SPARK solution 3 The BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK is an intelligent, powered ankle 
device designed to increase independence, mobility, and deliver gait training to children with 
movement disorders, such as CP (details reported in [4], [6], [19]). Unique features of the RAAD 
include:
 Lightweight (<1.5kg, 70% resides around the waist) and grows with the child.
 <Assist-and-Go= 3 All-terrain mobility assistance (both stance and swing phase assistance [18])
 <Resist-to-Restore= 3 Precision ankle neuro-rehabilitation resistance therapy for long-term 
gains [5]
 Battery powered and cloud-connected 3 Tracks improvement and compliance; creates virtual 
community
 Simple, inexpensive, and fast to manufacture 3 Minimizes material and assembly costs
 Design that accommodates differences in anatomy (e.g. adjustable waist straps, cable lengths)IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v06012022 Streamlined operation [ADDRESS_511875] of over-ground walking [4] and operating 
seamlessly across the variable walking conditions encountered during daily life. This closed-
loop approach utilizes embedded force sensors to provide intuitive, volitional control of 
exoskeleton assistance. As described above, this approach provides reliable, adaptive 
assistance by [CONTACT_405935]. Two recent validation
studies ([19] and In Review) demonstrates the ability of our control system to appropriately
adjust RAAD assistance relative to the plantar-flexor muscle moment during accel/decel,
level, incline, and decline walking at slow, medium, and fast speeds; stair ascent and
descent; and 90° turning ( 87.7 ± 2.7% average accuracy , R = 0.96 ± 0.01 average correlation
coefficient). This closed-loop control system offers a practical way to augment real-world 
walking performance without the need for complex classification.IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v06012022
Resist-to-Restore 3 We developed a purpose-built RAAD/SPARK resistance controller based 
on two primary design criteria. The first criterion was task-specificity : the controller must 
facilitate increased neuromuscular firing of the plantar flexor muscles during the portion of the 
gait cycle when they function to propel the body forward (i.e. push-off). The second criterion was 
user engagement : the controller should have minimal lag and provide a mechanical cue in 
response to changing user input (i.e. as someone pushes harder, more resistance is provided). 
To meet these goals, we implemented the inverse of our proportional joint-moment control 
scheme designed to provide adaptive resistance for a user to actively engage with during the 
stance phase of walking.

HRP-593 / v06012022First to market [ADDRESS_511876] to take several years.
Intelligent design 3 The RAAD/SPARK device was designed to maximize improvements in 
mobility. This is accomplished through the use of lightweight materials, like carbon fiber, and 
mechanical design. Unlike uncomfortable wearable <exosuits= that rely on the garment9s friction 
with the user9s bare skin, the RAAD/SPARK device ankle assembly is self-supported and the 
reaction forces from the Bowden cables are transmitted to the ground. Furthermore, the 
heaviest components, including the motors and battery, are located near the waist, which 
minimizes the metabolic energy required to carry the additional mass [22]. The cables, and 
uprights of the RAAD/SPARK
have built-in adjustability in order to adapt as a child grows. Each RAAD/SPARK device will 
come with the necessary components to grow with a child for an entire year. Following growth 
spurts, lightweight components, like the cables, carbon fiber footplates, and calf cuffs can be 
easily exchanged.
RAAD User Interface: The RAAD9s/SPARK9s physical user interface includes an on-off switch 
and a toggle switch for <Assist-&-Go= or <Resist-to-Restore.= The device needs to be initialized 
in
the phone app once per user by [CONTACT_405936], after which it can operate by [CONTACT_405937]. The system automatically calibrates the foot sensors for the first three steps
of walking, after which the torque gradually builds to the peak set point by 20% with each
consecutive step. The app allows control of the torque setpoint; default assistive and resistive
torque setpoints are 0.25 Nm/kg and 0.15 Nm/kg, respectively.
                                                        
   
All-Terrain Control: Our intuitive RAAD/SPARK control scheme (Proportional Joint-Moment 
Control) is based on the principle of providing assistance as a function of the biological ankle 
moment [19]. High resolution force sensors placed under the ball of the foot and the automatic 
calibration procedure are used predict the biological ankle moment. We have validated this 
control strategy in individuals with and without CP during treadmill, over-ground, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
turning, incline, and decline walking (see preliminary data). We have demonstrated that this IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.
STU#:00215607

HRP-593 / v06012022control strategy can effectively reduce the metabolic cost of transport during over-ground 
walking [4]. No adverse
events have occurred.
The BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK device will be stored in the Center for Bionic Medicine 
department, room 1402 in a locked area that is only accessible to trained research staff. 
It is determined that the study is not a significant risk with this device because of the safety
measures that will be employed while using the device. While using the BiOMOTUM 
RAAD/SPARK device, research participants will be supported at all times with trained research 
staff and, when needed, a gait belt or a harness per the discretion of the research staff. This 
safety precaution is commonly utilized in physical therapy practice with other robotic training 
interventions as well as traditional approaches like walking on compliant surfaces or balance 
beam walking. Thus, it is felt that the utilization of the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK, with the 
safety measures described, does not pose a significant potential for harming research 
participants.
PROCEDURES INVOLVED:
1. Screening/Baseline Procedures
1.1 We will recruit up to 30 participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Recruitment 
will occur through Shirley Ryan AbilityLab9s flagship hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405910]. 
We will also recruit form local physicians as well as the Cerebral Palsy Research 
Registry. Subjects will be divided into two groups: (a) always under therapi[INVESTIGATOR_405911] (b) with on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-supervised and two parent supervised 
sessions per week. Once subjects have agreed to participate in the study, they 
will be consented at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. Study staff will explain the 
study, a written consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_405938] 18 years or old (or 
by [CONTACT_174964]/guardian if subject is under 18 years old). If subject is younger 
than 18 but older than 12, in addition to parental/guardian consent, the subject 
will provide verbal and written ascent to participate. Children younger than 12 will 
provide verbal ascent along with parental/guardian consent. A copy will be given 
to the subject while the original document will be kept in a secure, locked cabinet.
1.[ADDRESS_511877] obtain medical 
clearance from all subjects9 physicians prior to baseline testing. 
1.3 Once they are enrolled, baseline outcome measures will be assessed by a 
trained research personnel.
2. Procedures during Treatment
2.1 After the baseline testing is completed, subjects will begin 12 sessions of 
training, 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks (missing no more than 3 session9s 
total). Up to an additional 3 training visits and/or 2-3 weeks may occur should the 
BiOMOTUM RAAD/BiOMOTUM SPARK/other similarly updated BiOMOTUM 
device require maintenance or updates during the child9s participation. Additional 
visits should only be required if adjustment is needed to ensure safety following 
changes. IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v06012022At minimum, [ADDRESS_511878] 
up to 1 hour and will include walking training in the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK 
device, with the device in resistance mode. Participants will be enrolled at 
GMFCS levels I-III, and randomly selected to complete the intervention in one of 
two modalities: (a)  always under therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20790], and (b)  with one therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-
supervised and two parent supervised sessions per week. All sessions, including 
those that are parent-supervised, will take place at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. 
During parent-supervised sessions that seek to replicate how a child would train 
at home, parents will ask their child to walk with resistance to the best of their 
ability until the time is up. Parents can use toys and snacks to incentivize session 
completion. 
Gait training will include approximately 20-30 minutes of treadmill walking; 
participants will complete three ~5-10-minute bouts of walking with seated rest 
periods in between. The research team will guide participants to walk at a 
moderate-to-high intensity for the duration of each walk as indicated by [INVESTIGATOR_67147] 7 
(<Hard=) on the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405912]9s Effort Rating Table (PCERT). To maintain 
intensity as participants progress through the protocol, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_405913]/or the resistance level once per week to ensure 
progression. Plantar-pressure biofeedback will be provided to each participant at 
least once per session.
2.[ADDRESS_511879] will increase the resistance level once per 
week to ensure progression.
2.3 During training and assessment sessions, the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK 
iPhone will record data from the device9s joint angle and Inertial measurement 
Unit (IMU) sensors regarding the subjects ankle angles and body position. 
Outcome Measures : 
The following outcome measures will be collected by [CONTACT_405939]: baseline, 2-[ADDRESS_511880]-intervention (after 12 training sessions), 
and 3 weeks following the final training session.
Clinical Performance Outcome Measures:
1. [ADDRESS_511881] (10MWT):  The 10MWT assesses walking speed in 
meters per second over a short duration. Changes in gait speed that result in a 
transition to a higher category of ambulation classification resulted in better 
function and quality of life. In the 10MWT, subjects are directed to walk at their 
self-selected and maximum safe speed with effects of acceleration and 
deceleration minimized (by [CONTACT_1583] 1 meter at the beginning and at the end of the 
course to isolate the subject9s steady state speed). Any assistive device and 
orthotic should be kept consistent and documented. It should also be 
documented whether the gait is treated at <self-selected walking speed= or 
<fastest walking speed=. Three trials will be completed at the self-selected speed 
and three trials will be completed at the fast speed. If someone is unable to 
complete all trials, then the reason will be documented in the CRF. IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v060120222. [ADDRESS_511882] (6MWT): The 6MWT measures the distance a 
subject can walkindoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of [ADDRESS_511883] will be performed while walking without the
device as well as with the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK. It will be administered 
while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption (Cosmed K5B2 Metabolic 
Unit) when performed without the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK. Electromyography 
may be used to assess lower-limb muscle activity during gait analysis trials 
and/or the 6MWT.
3. Timed Up and Go Test (TUG): The TUG assess mobility, balance, 
walking ability, and falls risk. The participant starts seated in a chair with his/her 
back against the chair back. On command, the participant rises form the chair, 
walks [ADDRESS_511884] may be repeated up to 3 times during each assessment visit 
and during each training visit.  
4. Gross Motor Function Measure -66 (GMFM-66): The GMFM-66 
measures change in gross motor function over time in children with cerebral 
palsy. This assessment quantifies motor function, not the quality of the motor 
performance. 
5. Gait Analysis:  A quantitative means of assessing gait function based on 
spatiotemporal parameters of gait. The GAITRite system is an electronic 
walkway with integrated sensors and is considered a reliable and valid means of 
assessing gait changes post stroke. Electromyography will be used to assess 
lower-limb muscle activity during gait analysis. This includes adding small 
sensors to thighs, lower legs, and shins. 
6. Muscle Strength Testing:  The purpose of this test is to evaluate the 
strength of the legs by [CONTACT_405940], maximum 
contraction while the researcher provides a static, counterforce. A handheld 
dynamometer will be used to detect the minimum muscle strength change.
Self-Reported Measures:
1. Patient Questionnaires:  This questionnaire will ask for the subject9s 
feedback regarding their experience and satisfaction after using the 
BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK device. 
On the first follow-up visit, we will assess subjective user experience 
and quantify the usability of the device. Each research PT, participant and 
parent/guardian will complete the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS 
includes 10 statements rated by [CONTACT_3553] a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and the SUS scores have a range of 
0 to 100 that is divided by [CONTACT_405941]: score of 0325: worst, score of [ZIP_CODE]: IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v06012022RECRUITMENT METHODS
Participants will be recruited through a rolling referral beginning immediately after the approval 
of this protocol. Recruitment will end once the appropriate number of subjects has been 
enrolled. To account for a subject withdrawal from the study, 2-[ADDRESS_511890] access to medical records will mine the data and identify all 
persons with cerebral palsy treated at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab who may be eligible to 
participate in this study. A research team member will approach, call, or email the potential 
participants/participant9s legal guardian and introduce the study. If the patient/patient9s legal 
guardian is interested in hearing more about the study, the team member will describe the 
project in detail. The team member will have recruitment flyers and a copy of the consent 
available for review. Per the potential participant9s/participant9s legal guardian9s preference and 
continued availability, consenting procedures may occur at this time or a later time. If the 
patient/patient9s legal guardian agrees to participate in the study, the team member will obtain 
written documentation of informed consent. 
Shirley Ryan AbilityLab approved flyers will be hung at the facility to advertise the study. 
Clinicians at this location will be informed of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study in 
order to refer appropriate subjects. Information regarding this study will be posted on Shirley 
Ryan AbilityLab9s available research studies webpage. Research Registries at Northwestern 
University and affiliates may also be utilized to find eligible participants. Potential research 
subjects will be referred to, and evaluated by, authorized research personnel. Potential research 
subjects will be identified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. After identification of 
subjects based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, a verbal permission from the patient or 
authorized guardian will be obtained to request medical clearance from their physician. 
COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
Subjects will be seen for [ADDRESS_511891] up to 4 
hours. Subjects will be paid $[ADDRESS_511892] from Shirley Ryan 
AbilityLab.  Payments in excess of $600 in a calendar year are required to be reported as 
taxable income.
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study in the event of a medical event or complication (i.e. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that may alter the inclusion/exclusion criteria or which limits the patient from 
safely completing the remainder of the study, or at the discretion of the PI. 
 
Subjects can voluntarily discontinue the study at any time. The participant will then be requested 
to notify the Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_405998], in writing or call at [PHONE_8373], if 
assistance is needed in this process. Information collected prior to the study discontinuation by 
a participant may still be used by [CONTACT_5051].  
The researchers reserve the right to discontinue study participation for any individual or for the 
study as a whole at their discretion.IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

HRP-593 / v06012022RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS
All testing and training sessions will be under supervision of a trained researcher.  Manual 
assistance or cueing will be provided as necessary for safety and balance.  Vital signs will be 
monitored before and after physical exertion and during activities, as needed.  All subjects will 
be permitted to stop physical activity or rest at any time during the study. 
÷The risk of falling: This could be caused by [CONTACT_405945][INVESTIGATOR_405916]/SPARK device 
itself. The risk of falling will be minimized by [CONTACT_405946], and as 
needed overhead attachment with a safety harness and/or gait belt during over-ground 
gait training. 
÷Discomfort, skin pressure/friction, bruising, pain, or unusual swelling caused by [CONTACT_405947]. This risk will 
be minimized by a thorough skin check performed by [CONTACT_405948]. Adjustments to the device fit and additional padding will be 
assessed to decrease the risk of skin breakdown as well. 
÷There may also be a risk of skin irritation caused by [CONTACT_405949], EMG sensors, and IMUs to the participant. This will be reduced by [CONTACT_405950].
÷Blood pressure instability during use of the device related to standing and walking 
activities during testing and training procedures. This risk will be reduced with frequent 
subjective assessment of patient9s symptoms as well as assessment of blood pressure 
and heart rate prior to training, as necessary during training and following training. 
Activity will be stopped in the event of instability of vital signs and as recognized by 
[CONTACT_405951]. Medical clearance will be required prior to any study 
related activities.
÷Risk of exceeding range of motion: This would be caused if any device moves the 
Participant beyond the normal range of motion, resulting in a strain, sprain or fracture. 
For the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK device, this risk is lessened by [CONTACT_405952] a normal human range of motion even in 
the event of an electrical or software failure. Software systems are also in place to 
further reduce range of motion to improve fit and comfort during walking. Participants will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_405953]. For all other devices, this 
risk will be mitigated through proper settings by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_405917].
÷Spasms triggered by [CONTACT_405954]. This risk will be reduced through 
screening prior to enrollment in the study. Participants cannot take part if the 
participant9s muscles are too stiff.
÷There is a risk of fractures when participating in a therapy program: this will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_405955].
÷The device itself could malfunction. All activities will be performed with close supervision 
from trained research personnel to monitor device function during use.
÷The use of the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK system may involve risks that are currently 
unforeseeable as this is a trial to assess use of the BiOMOTUM RAAD/SPARK device in 
the pediatric population with cerebral palsy.IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS There may be no direct benefit to the 
participants. The main benefit of this study is to better understand the use of technology to 
enhance gait ability of pediatric population with cerebral palsy. 
PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF 
PARTICIPANTS
Participants will be notified if any new information concerning the safety of the study device 
becomes available which may affect their decision to remain in the study. Participants will 
however be asked to perform all activities under the supervision of a trained research staff 
member.
DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN
The risks in this study are minimized by [CONTACT_405956][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. In addition, the primary 
research team is qualified and experienced in all of the study procedures. Nonetheless, since this 
study places the subjects at more than minimal risk, we utilize the services of a volunteer to serve 
as a Safety Officer at each sub-award research site. 
1. Safety Officer(s) 
1. The Safety Officer at each research site will be solicited upon receipt of award and 
will be a faculty member from each sub-award location (NAU, Gillette, SRA Lab) 
who is experienced in clinical research. We will avoid conflict of interest by 
[CONTACT_30224] a person who is not affiliated with any member of the research team (i.e. 
not a collaborator) 
2. The Safety Officer will meet with study investigators twice annually. During these 
meetings, the following information will be reviewed: 
i. Adverse events report (see below) 
ii. Recruitment and enrollment statistics including the following information: 
1. Gender, ethnicity 
2. Number of subjects who were disqualified prior to randomization 
and reasons 
3. Number of subjects randomized 
4. Number of subjects who have withdrawn or been withdrawn from 
the study, and the reasons for withdrawal 
5. Number who subjects who have completed each phase of the study 
3. The Safety Officer will take minutes of the meeting, and after the meeting will 
distribute copi[INVESTIGATOR_405918]. The minutes will be 
reviewed at the beginning of the next Safety Officer meeting 
2. Adverse events reporting 
The sub-award lead investigator ([CONTACT_395182], [CONTACT_19072], and [CONTACT_405999]) will 
continually monitor all adverse events during the screening process and during 
procedures performed as part of this research. 
i. When a screening failure occurs, the individual will be contact[CONTACT_405957]-award 
lead investigator and be informed of the reasons for screening failure. IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.
STU#:00215607
Version Date:  06/01/2022 18 of 22
HRP-593 / v06012022ii. All adverse events will be reported to the safety officer monthly, and documented 
by [CONTACT_405958]. 
Adverse events will be any event that does not satisfy the criteria for serious 
adverse events.
iii. All serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the safety officer, IRB 
Research Subjects Advocate, and the NIH, in a timely manner (e.g. within 48 h) 
using the IRB Serious Adverse Report Event (SAE) form. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_405919], and a copy of the consent form signed by [CONTACT_405959], with 
relevant sections highlighted. Serious adverse events are defined as:
1. Death 
2. Life threatening injuries 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
For all serious adverse events that are determined by [CONTACT_405960], probably, or 
possibly related to the study or interventions, the IRB will take whatever action(s) it deems 
appropriate, including but not limited to: 
1. Modification of the protocol 
2. Modification of the consent form document 
3. Modification to the timetable for continuing review requirements 
4. Suspension of new enrollment into the study 
5. Suspension or termination of the study - If the study is suspended or terminated, it 
will be promptly reported to the NIH institute that has provided funding for the study. 
All other events not requiring suspension or termination shall be reported during 
the annual progress report. 
ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements
This study will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. All relevant findings will be reported at the end 
of the study.
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
Every possible precaution will be taken to protect the privacy interests of subjects. Participation 
in this study is completely voluntary. Trained research personnel will explain the purpose of the 
study and intended use of subject9s personal health information and precautions taken to keep 
the study information and data confidential.
Subjects have the right to refuse to answer to any questions they feel uncomfortable answering
and the research team will mark these questions as unanswered. Furthermore, participants can
refuse other objective tests in the protocol however if the participants refuse the majority of tests
which affect the overall implementation of the study, the participants may be withdrawn from the 
study at the discretion of the principal investigator. 
COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY
If the participant has any injury or illness from the study device or the procedures required for 
this study, the reasonable medical expenses required to treat such injury or illness may be paid 
for by [CONTACT_4530].IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.
STU#:00215607
Version Date:  06/01/2022 19 of 22
HRP-593 / v06012022The coverage for such injury or illness is only available if the Northwestern University principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_405920]/illness is directly related to the study 
device or procedures and is not the results of a pre-existing condition or the normal progression 
of the participant9s disease, or because they have not followed the directions of the study 
doctor. If the participant9s insurance is billed, they may be required to pay deductibles and 
copayments that apply. The participant should check with their insurance company about any 
such payments .
ECONOMIC BURDEN TO PARTICIPANTS
Costs associated with participation in the study will be offset by [CONTACT_405961] ($50 each training session and $50 for each assessment).
CONSENT PROCESS
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with
federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. In 
obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of 
the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must 
include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_80279]. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the 
investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, 
the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_405962].
Should there be amendment made to the consent form after the initial signature [CONTACT_80286], 
the subject will be required to sign a new consent form at their next visit. A researcher will 
review the changes and discuss the implications of the change.
Prior to a patient9s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form must be signed 
and personally dated by [CONTACT_37781]. The consent process will take place at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Room 11- 
1402. Trained research personnel will guide the subject through consenting process. Subject 
will be given detailed explanation of the purpose, time line, commitment, procedures, data 
handling and privacy and confidentiality of information pertaining to the study.
NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING PARTICIPANTS
An interpreter who speaks the participant9s primary language will be scheduled through the
Shirley Ryan Ability Lab Interpreter Services department to attend all research appointments
during which the participant is scheduled if necessary as determined by [CONTACT_2299].
PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NOT YET ADULTS (infants, children, teenagers )
Participants will be asked their age upon study screen. Any child under the age of 18 years will 
be considered a minor. If the participant is determined a minor, every effort will be made to 
ensure the screening process proceeds with a parent or an authorized legal guardian present. 
The consent and protocol will be explained by a trained researcher to both the present 
parent/authorized legal guardian and the minor. The parent or authorized legal guardian will 
then be asked to consent on behalf of the minor, in accordance with the DHHS and the IRB #: STU00215607 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/10/2024 through 6/9/2025.
STU#:00215607

HRP-593 / v06012022USFDA9s subpart D. The parent or authorized legal guardian will also be given the opportunity 
present at all training and testing sessions. 
Consent will be obtained from one parent even if the other parent is alive, known, competent, 
reasonably available, and shares legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child. This 
will be done to ensure the protocol is carried through in a timely manner.
Permission will also be obtained from an authorized legal guardian if necessary. Efforts will be 
made to determine whether the guardian is in fact legally authorized by [CONTACT_405963]. 
Assent will be obtained from all children. Verbal assent will be obtained for children unable to 
give written consent. Assent will be documented in the IRB approved consent form.
PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI AND HIPAA)
Subjects records will be kept completely confidential: Every possible precaution will be taken to 
protect the privacy interests of subjects. Participation in this study is completely voluntary. 
Trained research personnel will explain the purpose of the study and intended use of a subject9s 
medical information and the precautions taken to keep the study information and data 
confidential. Data will be collected and kept confidential and compliant with HIPAA standards.
Participants will be assigned an alphabetical or numerical study ID. Identifying data will be kept 
in locked cabinets and password protected servers completely separate from de-identified data. 
Research data will be de-identified and stored in locked cabinets in the lab accessible only by 
[CONTACT_80282]. Electronic data will be de-identified and kept on secure, 
password protected servers at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab. Only authorized research staff will 
be able to access any of the formerly mentioned data. De-identified data will be kept indefinitely. 
Study documentation will be collected and stored and kept confidential and compliant with 
HIPAA requirements. Identifying data will be held for 7 years after the study is completed and 
published.
All personal information (names, addresses, email or phone numbers, etc.) gathered for this 
study that can identify participants will be kept secure to protect their privacy and will never be 
shared at any time with any person or entity. Data collected during the study and shared with 
others will reference participants only by [CONTACT_80277]. The <master list= linking 
personal information to the alphanumeric code will not be shared, and will be kept by [CONTACT_80278] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a secure location. All personal information linking participants to their data will be 
destroyed after [ADDRESS_511893] RESEARCH AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE

1.1 Purpose:  
The purpose of this investigation is to establish the feasib ility and efficacy of a 
lightweight, battery-powered ankle brace system (ABS) to imp rove mobility for 
individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). 
¥ Aim 1: Complete a personal-use feasibility analysis of the ABS. This aim will be 
completed by [CONTACT_405971], 
Inc. (prime site/sponsor), and activities will be covered  by a separate IRB 
protocol.  
¥ Aim 2: Gather feedback from Aim 1 to design and prototype a minimum viable 
ABS for use in clinical and community settings. This aim will be completed by 
[CONTACT_405972], Shirley Ryan Abi lity Lab, and 
BiOMOTUM, Inc., and activities will be covered by [CONTACT_405973].  
¥ Aim 3: Quantify the potential for an ABS to increase the effe ctiveness of 
clinical gait therapy by [CONTACT_405974]. This aim 
will be completed by [CONTACT_405975]9s Specialty Healthcare (Gillette), and 
activities will be covered by [CONTACT_405976].   
2.0 Background 
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
Many of the 500,[ADDRESS_511903] difficulty walk ing and participating in 
physical activity. Half of all ambulatory children with CP los e the ability to walk 
independently in adulthood, indicating that the current approac hes for treating 
these individuals do not result in meaningfully improved  mobility over time. 
Physical therapy (PT) is essential for treating CP, but the am ount of PT is generally 
insufficient, and the delivery of PT can be inefficient. There is currently no viable 
way to provide a sufficient dose of PT that will lead to lon g-term improvements in 
mobility and reduce the negative physical and social outcome s related to limited 
mobility and reduced physical activity. 
Due to the lack of available and sufficient treatment methods fo r improving 
mobility, the study team aims to establish the feasibility and e fficacy of an ABS for 
assistance  and resistance  training. In the long-term, this research will improve ou r 
ability to optimize the prescription of wearable assistive dev ices to improve 
mobility and increase physical activity in individuals with movement disorders.

powered ABS. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_405925], five 
participants with CP (5-30 years old) practiced walking at sel f-selected speeds 
with powered plantarflexor assistance. Participants exhibited a 19% reduction 
(p<0.05) in net metabolic cost of transport on average during tr eadmill walking 
with assistance compared to their baseline walking condition.  Compared to 
baseline, participants also had reduced crouch by 14.4 ± 4 degrees ( p<0.05) across 
the lower extremities, increased positive ankle power by 43.6 ± 7.4% (p<0.05), 
and decreased positive hip power by 29.2 ± 6.0% ( p<0.01).[ADDRESS_511905] the powered ankle brace resistance  therapy, 
participants completed 10 training sessions over 4 weeks w ith progressively 
increasing levels of resistance. Participants exhibited sig nificantly improved 
(reduced) stance-phase ankle co-contraction by 29% ± 13% ( p<0.04) and a more 
normal plantarflexor muscle activation profile by 30% ± 15% (p<0.02). 
Additionally, an increase in neural control complexity of walking after training was 
observed, which was significantly greater than a matched contr ol group that 
underwent standard orthopedic and neurologic surgery alone . These 
improvements in neuromuscular control are indicative of a more mechanically 
efficient gait pattern, improved metabolic cost, and enhanced functional 
performance.2,3 
2.3 Existing Literature:  
Children with CP frequently experience a downward trend of reduced physical 
activity and worsening gait, leading to a permanent decrease or  loss in 
ambulatory ability.[ADDRESS_511906] individuals with spastic CP. Reduced ankle  performance during 
walking in children with CP is suggested as a primary con tributor to the observed 
gait dysfunction.9 Ankle plantarflexors of children with CP produce 50% l ess

a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PT) will be present. To ex plore a participant9s 
accommodation to the device, the PT, at their discretion, may use 
electromyography, metabolic measurements, and/or 10 m and 6  minute-walk-
tests. Participant, parent/guardian, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_405926] m ay be 
provided. If interested and eligible, they would be invi ted to participate in 
Experiments 1 and 2, although participation in the Exploration  phase is not a 
requisite for participation in Experiments 1 and/or 2. 
 
Experiment 1: 
In Experiment 1, participants will come to Gillette for a base line visit. This 
baseline visit will include ABS fitting and acclimation. Fo llowing the baseline visit, 
participants will return to Gillette for 3 additional visits in  a randomized order: 
assistance visit, resistance visit, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_405927] t. During each visit, a 
licensed PT will guide participants through the following  activities while collecting 
plantarflexor activity via surface electromyograph (EMG): 10 m inutes of treadmill 
walking, 10 minutes of overground walking, and 15 minute s of walking skills 
practice (e.g., sideways, backward, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], etc. ). 
Experiment 2: 
In Experiment 2, participants will come to Gillette for a base line visit. Like 
Experiment 1, this baseline visit will consist of ABS fi tting and acclimation. 
Following the baseline visit, participants will return to Gi llette for 12 visits with 
assistance  training. Assistance training will include approximately 20 -30 minutes 
of overground walking with assistance monitored by [CONTACT_115395];  participants will 
complete three ~5-10-minute bouts of walking with seated res t periods in 
between. The research team will guide participants to walk at a moderate-to-high 
intensity for the duration of each walk as indicated by [INVESTIGATOR_67147]  7 (<Hard=) on the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405912]9s Effort Rating Table (PCERT).[ADDRESS_511909]-training. At the baselin e and follow-up visits, 
the participants will complete the following activities guide d by a PT: standard 
three-dimensional gait analysis (e.g., metabolic cost, 6MWT, gait kinematics and 
kinetics, surface EMG, and physical examination), TUG, and G MFM-66 dimensions 
D and E (e.g., walking, running, and jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_160981]).

4.2 Drug/Device Handling:  
The ABS is a lightweight battery-powered ankle orthosis. Th e system includes a 
torque sensor, system controller, battery, cables, calf cuf f and frame, foot plate, 
and sensor inserted in a shoe (Figure 1A). The complete  ABS system has a total 
mass of 1.5 kg (70% of mass situated in a waist pack or backp ack) and allows the 
user to move around freely (Figure 1B). 
 
The ABS provides a small amount of motorized assistance that is  intended to 
augment existing activity. This and other similar investigation al devices have been 
classified by [CONTACT_395178] a nonsignificant risk device  
because they do not meet the definition of significant risk  under 812.3(m) of the 
investigational device exemption (IDE) regulation ([ADDRESS_511911]: Non-Significant Risk Device). In other w ords, the ABS:  
¥ is not an implant; 
¥ is not supporting or sustaining life; 
¥ is not used for diagnosing/curing/mitigating/treating diseas e; and 
¥ does not present the potential for serious risk to health or  safety.  
Additionally, several safety precautions are implemented to e nsure participant 
safety, including mechanical <stops= to prevent hyperextens ion of joints, an 
emergency stop button that shuts off power to the device, and  embedded 
software mechanisms that shut off power to the device if the  user were to fall.

Exploration: 
For the Exploration phase, participants will come to Gillette for up to two visits. 
These visits will include ABS fitting and acclimation, whi ch may take up to 60 
minutes each visit. Participants will walk with the unpowered  and powered ABS 
to assess device usability, device comfort, and ease of do nning/doffing. 
Additionally, they will complete a qualitative assessment to do cument their 
experience. This exploratory work will allow participants to test the ABS and 
provide feedback to investigators prior to the Experimental  phase. A licensed PT 
will be present to assist as needed. If interested and eligi ble, participants of the 
Exploration phase would be invited to participate in Experim ents 1 and 2, 
although this participation is not a requisite for Experiment 1 and/or 2 
participation. 
Experiment 1: 
For Experiment 1, participants will come to Gillette for a b aseline visit. This 
baseline visit will include ABS fitting and acclimation, wh ich will take roughly 60 
minutes. No full gait analysis is needed because compariso n is primarily between 
the three sessions for relative changes in surface EMG. Par ticipants will walk with 
the unpowered ABS to assess comfort and fitting. The devic e will be adjusted to 
fit each participant. A short unassisted/unresisted walking bo ut will be completed 
and the device further adjusted for comfort. Once fitted pr operly, each 
participant will walk for 10 minutes with resistance  and 10 minutes with 
assistance . The magnitude of resistance and assistance will be graduall y increased 
until the participant9s preferred levels are established. Th ese levels will be 
recorded and used for the following visits. Breaks will  be provided, as needed. 
Following the baseline visit, participants will return to Gi llette for 3 additional 
visits over 3 weeks: assistance visit, resistance visit, and  typi[INVESTIGATOR_405928].

9.2 Additional Safeguards: 
Cerebral palsy is a common neuromuscular disorder that dev elops during 
childhood and persists throughout the lifetime. Diagnosis,  medical decision-
making, and treatment often occur during childhood and adole scence, making 
children the population of interest. 
This study involves no greater than minimal risk, so only  one legally authorized 
representative (LAR) will provide consent for the minor participant. It will be 
communicated to participants and their LAR that participation in the research 
study is voluntary during the informed consent process. The child participant or 
LAR can indicate if they wish to discontinue participation at any  point. 
10.0 Local Number of Participants 
10.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented:  
In total, up to 50 participants may be consented into the study c onducted at 
Gillette, which includes the Exploration phase and Experim ental phase. 
Up to 20 participants may be consented into the Exploration ph ase. This is a 
sample of convenience and is preparatory to Experiments 1 and 2. 
Up to 15 participants may be consented into each Experiment ( i.e., up to 30 total) 
to account for possible attrition and incomplete data. This wil l ensure we reach 
our recruitment goal of [ADDRESS_511918] ete data in each 
Experiment.  
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods 
11.1 Recruitment Process:  
Gillette study team members may contact [CONTACT_405986], phone call, and/o r in-person during a 
standard of care visit to explain study and determine interest.  If a potential 
participant is interested, study team members will follow-up  to answer questions, 
determine eligibility, and schedule research visits as app ropriate. Email 
communication will be utilized when possible. 
11.2 Identification of Potential Participants:  
Potential participants will be identified through a screening  of the Gillette medical 
record and the Gillette Center for Gait and Motion Analysis datab ase and 
schedule. Gillette study team members have access to the medi cal record as a

used.  
The study coordinator and/or study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_405930]. However, any study team member at Gillette indicated as b eing involved in 
consent may contact [CONTACT_405987]. 
Of note, collaborators will not be involved with participant contact [CONTACT_405988]. 
11.3 Recruitment Materials:  
A study team member, most often the study coordinator and/or physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], will make initial contact [CONTACT_405989], discussing in-pe rson during a standard 
of care visit, and/or calling on the phone.  
11.4 Payment:  
For participants in the Exploration phase, they will not rece ive compensation. For 
participants in Experiment 1, they will receive $50 compe nsation per visit for 4 
visits ($200 per participant). For participants in Experimen t 2, they will receive 
$40 compensation per visit for 15 visits ($600 per partic ipant). These dollar 
amounts are similar to past Gillette studies with similar time an d effort 
commitments. Additionally, participants will be reimbursed for roundtrip mileage 
at the current federal rate. Hotel and parking will be offere d to families that 
travel overnight and are traveling from a distance of [ADDRESS_511919] has been added to the consent forms as

12.0 Withdrawal of Participants 
12.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Participants will be withdrawn if they are later identified as not meeting the 
inclusion criteria (e.g., identified as eligible in erro r), if they miss more than 3 
research visits in a given Experiment, or if they decide  to stop participating in the 
study. 
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures:

from the study. 
12.3 Termination Procedures:  
Data collected and completed up to the point of withdrawal or te rmination will 
still be included in the study unless the participant asks o therwise. 
13.0 Risks to Participants 
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
The potential minimal risks associated with this study are as f ollows:  
First, is the risk of falling during ambulatory activities p erformed during this 
protocol but this is no greater than during normal daily li fe. Additionally, this risk 
will be minimized by [CONTACT_405990] a licensed PT an d the use of a safety 
harness and/or walker for unstable participants.  
Second, is the risk of fatigue, shortness of breath, or m uscle soreness during or 
after the research visits. It is expected that when these sympto ms occur, they will 
be minor and brief. If a participant experiences excessive  shortness of breath or 
fatigue, they will be allowed to stop and given adequate rest before continuing. 
Should the participant experience any muscle soreness, li ght stretching, and 
hot/cold therapy will be recommended to reduce soreness . If these approaches 
do not alleviate the soreness, we will advise the use of O TC pain relievers (e.g., 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], acetaminophen, ibuprofen), unless contraindicated.  As previously 
mentioned, a licensed PT will be present at each research visit. 
Third, there is a risk of stumbling or falling while wal king with the ABS. The 
amount of ankle assistance/resistance is not designed or able  to completely over-
power the user.  As previously mentioned, several safety precautions are 
implemented to ensure participant safety, including mechanic al <stops= to 
prevent hyperextension of joints, an emergency stop button  that shuts off power 
to the device, and embedded software mechanisms that shut off  power if the 
user were to fall. Lastly, a licensed PT will be present at each research visit. 
Fourth, there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality as  part of participating in 
research. Study team members are trained on appropriate data use  and storage, 
and every reasonable effort is made to minimize risk associ ated with loss of 
privacy and confidentiality.

14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants 
14.1 Potential Benefits:  
Potential benefits for this study include determining if w earable ankle assistance 
or resistance are viable treatment strategies for our participants , which can be 
used to guide future treatments and therapy and possible impro vement in 
mobility.  
15.0 Statistical Considerations 
15.1 Data Analysis Plan: 
Data will be collected and analyzed by [CONTACT_405991].  
Exploration: 
As described below, the Exploration phase is a sample of convenience, and these 
activities are preparatory to the Experimental phase. 
Experiments 1 and 2: 
For Experiments 1 and 2, power analyses were used to dete rmined estimated 
sample sizes. Statistical procedures include Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM-
ANOVA) and generalized linear models. Participants in each E xperiment will be 
age-, GMFCS-, and sex-matched as appropriate to control for kn own and 
unknown covariates. Participant demographics and baseline char acteristics will 
also be analyzed. 
15.2 Power Analysis:  
Exploration: 
No power analysis was done for the Exploration phase; this is a sample of 
convenience. 
Experiment 1: 
The sample size for the primary outcome measure in Experi ment 1, mean stance 
phase plantar-flexor activity, was determined for the Repeated Me asures ANOVA 
(RM-ANOVA). We set the Type II error rate (beta) at 0.2, and ther efore the power 
level at 0.8 and alpha at 0.05. Sample size was determined base d on the 
difference in soleus activity (45 ± 35%) from our collab orators preliminary ABS 
resistance validation study. We found that a subject sample size  of n = 10 will

 Page 25 of 35  Template Revised On: 09/01/[ADDRESS_511921] complete data for 12 
participants to provide an adequate sample for our investigation  into participant 
characteristics that will be correlated with outcomes. 
Experiment 2: 
The sample size for the primary outcome measures in Exper iment 2 was 
determined for the RM-ANOVA using our preliminary over- ground RAAD 
assistance training study (speed: 24±10%; normality of soleu s profile: 39±20%; 
see section 2.2 Preliminary Data). We found that a sample size  of n = 5 will allow 
us to find statistical significance for the assistance training protocol. We will enroll 
12 participants to provide an adequate sample for our investig ation into 
participant characteristics (i.e., covariates) that will be corre lated with outcomes. 
15.3 Statistical Analysis:  
Exploration: 
For the Exploration phase, qualitative data will be collected to  assess device 
usability, device comfort, and ease of donning/doffing. There is no formal 
statistical analysis plan as this phase is only preparatory for E xperiments 1 and 2. 
Experiment 1: 
For Experiment 1, RM-ANOVA will be used to compare our o utcome measures 
between each RAAD condition and unassisted therapy. A <clini cally-relevant= 
improvement will be defined as an improvement of 10%, o r more, over baseline 
for each outcome measure. Cohen9s d will be used to calc ulate effect size.17 To 
account for sex as a biological variable, we will recruit an eq ual number of males 
and females, matched by [CONTACT_405992] 2-years. We wil l use a 
generalized linear model to determine if participant character istics and delivery 
any potential interactions mode (assistance vs. resistance) sig nificantly contribute 
to our outcome measures. 
Experiment 2: 
For Experiment 2, RM-ANOVA will be used to compare the c hange in our outcome 
measures across assessments. Additionally, a generalized line ar model will be 
used to determine the participant characteristics that significantl y contribute to 
our outcome measures (e.g., sex, age, spasticity, gender,  height, GMFCS level), 
and any potential interactions with delivery mode (assistance vs  PT-guided 
resistance vs PT-&-parent-guided resistance). Similar to th e other Experiment, to 
account for sex as a biological variable, we will recruit an  equal number of males 
and females within each GMFCS level, matched by [CONTACT_405983] [ADDRESS_511922]

21.0 Consent Process 
21.1 Consent Process (when consent will be obtained):  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Development of a robotic ankle assist device to improve mobil ity in 
individuals with movement disorders  
VERSION DATE: 11/09/2022 
 Page 31 of 35  Template Revised On: 09/01/2019  Gillette study team members that are trained and delegated will o btain informed 
consent in-person and in a private setting at Gillette.  
The LAR will be asked to sign a consent form for each ph ase the participant will 
complete (e.g., Exploration and/or Experimental). Participan ts 8 to 17 years old 
with no or mild cognitive impairment will be asked to sig n an assent form. If a 
participant is unable to sign an assent form due to cognitive or physical abilities, 
verbal assent (e.g., physical or verbal cues) will be ob tained and documented as 
appropriate. If the LAR indicates that the child has more than mil d cognitive 
delays, assent will not be obtained and will be documented as  appropriate. A 
comment of study participation will be made in the participants  medical record as 
communication with other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]. 
21.2 Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (when consent wil l not be obtained):  
N/A 
21.3 Waiver of Written/Signed Documentation of Consent (when wr itten/signed 
consent will not be obtained):  
N/A 
21.4 Non-English-Speaking Participants:  
N/A 
21.5 Participants Who Are Not Yet Adults (infants, children, teenag ers under 18 years 
of age): 
We will use the Gillette medical record to extract date of bi rth to determine that 
potential participants qualify. 
Further, informed consent will only be obtained from on e LAR because the study 
constitutes no greater than minimal risk. 
There is no regulation on the exact age at which a child is required to complete a 
written assent. For our study, we have chosen to consent chi ldren (with no or 
mild cognitive impairment) who are ages 8 to 17 years old and should be able to 
understand the relatively simple study activities. If a particip ant can write, written 
assent will be obtained. If not, physical or verbal cues wi ll be documented as 
assent when possible and appropriate.  If the LAR indicates that the child has 
more than mild cognitive delays, assent will not be obtained  and will be 
documented as appropriate.

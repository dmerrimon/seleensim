Brief Overview: This is a phase II double -blind placebo -controlled clinical trial 
evaluating the effect of gabapentin when added to standard pain management  for patients 
with sickle cell disease experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting . 
Patients will be random ized to receive a single oral dose of gabapentin or placebo as soon 
as feasible after enrollment.  Pain scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_663989] , along with the outcomes of discharge from clinic versus  
admission to the inpatient unit.   
Intervention: Gabapentin 15mg /kg vs placebo  (single dose  by [CONTACT_1966] ) 
Brief Outline of Treatment Plan:  Participants will receive a single dose of study drug  
by [CONTACT_1966] a s soon as feasible after enrollment, while standard pain management is 
provided concurrently.  The remainder of care for the painful event will continue per 
institutional standards according to clinical indication, including reassessment and 
documentation of pain and additional doses of pain medicines by [CONTACT_664025].  
Treating clinicians will determine if the patient may be discharged home or if admission 
is warranted.   
Study Design: Phase II double -blind placebo -controlled therapeutic trial. 
Sample Size: 166 participants  divided evenly  between active and placebo ar ms.

 2.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
  2.1 Background:  
 Gabapentin has been  used successfully to treat neuropathic pain [ 1-3], and 
nociceptive pain  [4].  The mechanism of action is binding of the α -2-δ subunits of 
the voltage -dependent calcium ion channels, which blocks the development of 
hyperalgesia and central sensitization  [5, 6].  The reasons for the effectiveness of 
gabapentin for nociceptive pain are based on several considerations:  
 1. Gabapentin has been shown to prevent central sensitization, manifested as hyperalgesia, a known phenomenon in postope rative pain  [7].  The 
mechanism for reduction of central sensitization is the reduction of 
hyperexcitability of secondary nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn, 
through suppressing the release of excitatory amino acids in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_663992] [ 8]. 
2. Gabapentin and morphine may be synergistic due to separate actions on the peripheral and central nervous system [ 9]. 
3. Gabapentin may decrease the postoperative morphine requirement by 
[CONTACT_664028][INVESTIGATOR_74433] [ 10]. 
Sixteen randomized controlled trials were included in a systematic review of 
gabapentin use for postoperative pain [ 4]. 
Among three different gabapentin regimens including a single dose of 1200 mg 
preoperatively, a <1200 mg single dose preoperatively, multiple doses 
perioperatively (both preoperatively and postoperatively), the regimens of single doses of 1200 mg or less were found effective by [CONTACT_664029]: 1) reduced pain intensity scores, and 2) reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_651470] [ADDRESS_896751] for rescue analgesia with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. 
In a randomized controlled study of gabapentin 15 mg/kg single dose versus placebo in children aged 9 to 18 years undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_61679], the 
investigators found a significant decrease in the total morphine consumption in 
the gabapentin group, in the recovery room, and at postoperative day 1 and 2 [ 11]. 
The pain scores were also significantly decreased in the gabapentin group in the

 recovery room and at postoperative day 1.  In this study, gabapentin versus 
placebo was administered postoperatively for 5 days, at doses of 5 mg/kg TID; the 
analgesic benefit of gabapentin was only found for the first  [ADDRESS_896752] effective pain treatment should intervene early in the 
course of a VOC, in the prodromal phase; early intervention could prevent or 
minimize tissue damage  [12].  If we can demonstrate that a therapeutic 
intervention with a single dose of gabapentin can provide analgesic efficacy, this  
drug could be utilized  as an early intervention, which can be initiated at home, in 
the prodromal phase of a VOC.  
In addition to ample evidence of efficacy for management of neuropathic pain, 
gabapentin has proven opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- sparing effects in an acute pain setting, that of acute 
postoper ative pain, in adults  [13, 14] and children [ 11].  The regimen applied in 
the pediatric postoperative setting, in children 9 to 18 years, was gabapentin 15 mg/kg versus placebo, given preoperatively.  After surgery, the regimen continued as 5 mg/kg or placebo 3 times a day for 5 days.  This regimen of an 
initial preoperative loading dose and continued oral gabapentin postoperatively 
decreased the total morphine consumption and pain scores up to 2 days postoperatively, but no benefit was demonstrated beyond 2 days.    Additional Literature review of gabapentin for acute postoperative pain 
Cochrane review  
A Cochrane review has evaluated the single oral dose, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trials of gabapentin for relief of established moder ate to severe 
postoperative pain in adults (>15 yrs) [15]; the dose evaluated in the review was a 
[ADDRESS_896753] 50% of maximum possible total pain relief (TOTPAR) or summed pain intensity difference (SPID)  with gabapentin or

 medication, and time to its use, were sought as additional measures of eff icacy. 
Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected.  Four unpublished 
studies met inclusion criteria; in three, participants had pain following dental 
surgery, and one followed major orthopedic surgery; [ADDRESS_896754] 50% pain relief over 6 hours was achieved by 15% with gabapentin 250 mg and 5% with placebo; giving a RB of 2.5 (95% CI 1.2 to 5.0) 
and an NNT of 11 (6.4 to 35).  S ignificantly fewer participants needed rescue 
medication within 6 hours with gabapentin 250 mg than with placebo; NNT to 
prevent use 5.8.  About one third of participants reported adverse events with both gabapentin 250 mg and placebo.  No serious adverse events occurred with 
gabapentin.  The authors’ conclusions were that gabapentin [ADDRESS_896755] 50% pain relief over [ADDRESS_896756] of an antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_663993].

Based on the evidence that low dose gabapentin (250 mg, approximately 3-

study intervention, at 15 mg/kg, maximum 900 mg.

 Three meta- analyses [16-18] and one systematic review [4] provide reviews of 
placebo controlled RCTs of the use of gabapentin for perioperative pain control in 
adults.  The systematic review [4] included 16 RCTs in the analysis.  A total of 
1151 patients were studied, of whom 614 patients received gabapentin. Gabapentin was given as a single preoperative dose in 11 [13, 19-27] , as two 
separate preoperative doses in 1 [28], and as more than two doses in the 
perioperative period in four clinical trials [14, 29-31] .  The dosages of gabapentin 
administered ranged between 300 and 1200 mg. To facilitate quantitative analysis, three subgroups were created: (i) group receiving single dose of gabapentin 1200 mg preoperatively; (ii) group receiving single dose of gabapentin less than 1200 mg preoperati vely; and (iii) group receiving multiple doses of gabapentin in the 
perioperative period.  Pain intensity, total analgesic consumption and time to first request for rescue analgesia were analyzed separately in each subgroup.   
Eight trials used a single pr eoperative dose of 1200 mg gabapentin in the 
treatment group [13, 19, 22, 24-27, 32] Combined data on pain intensity in six 
studies [ 13, 21, 22, 25-27, 32] showe d a significant decrease in pain intensity at 
rest with gabapentin compared with control in the early by [CONTACT_664030] (WMD, -16.55 mm; 95% CI -25.66 to -7.44) and late (WMD, -10.87 
mm; 95% CI -20.90 to -0.84) postoperative period at 6 and 24 h, respectively.  
Combined data from three studies that reported on opi[INVESTIGATOR_57288] 24 h [13, 22, 24] showed that the WMD of -27.9 mg (95% CI -31.52 to -24.29) was in 
favor of gabapentin.  Meta -analysis of the two studies with data on the time to 
first request for rescue analgesic [13, 32] showed that gabapentin produced a 
statistically significant delay in time to first request for analgesia (WMD 7.42 min; 95% CI 0.49–14.34). 
Five studies with seven treatment arms used a single preoperative dose of 
gabapentin that was less than1200 mg [20-23, 27]. The dose range was between 
[ADDRESS_896757] with gabapentin compared with 
control in the early postoperative period at 6 h ( WMD, -22.43 mm; 95% CI -27.66 
to -17.19).  Combined data from four RCTs [20-23] showed lower pain scores at 
rest in the gabapentin group in the late postoperative period at 24 h (WMD, -13.18 
mm; 95% CI -19.68 to -6.68).  Combined data from four RCTs [20-23] showed 
that gabapentin reduced postoperative morphine consumption compared with control (WMD, -15.98 mg; 95% CI -23.45 to -8.50).  None of the five studies 
measured time to first analgesia as an outcome.

 Five studies reported gabapentin given as multiple doses perioperatively.  
Gabapentin was administered as follows in these five studies: 1) two separate 400 mg doses preoperatively [28]; 2) 600 mg 1 h preoperatively and then three times a 
day for 24 h postoperatively [30]; 3)1200 mg of gabapentin before surgery 
followed by 600 mg 8 hourly for an additional three doses [29]; 4) 400 mg 
gabapentin the night before surgery and then 400 mg three times a day for 10 days [14]; and 5)[ADDRESS_896758] and second postoperative day [31].  Only two out of the five 
trials had data suitable for meta -analysis for the pain intensity  outcome measure 
[14, 30]; the combined data did not show any difference between gabapentin and 
control groups at both 6 and 24 h after surgery.  Only one study measured 24 h 
morphine consumption as an outcome [31]: it showed a 24% reduction in total 
patient -controlled analgesia morphine usage in the gabapentin group compared 
with the control group.  Only one study presented the time to first request for 
rescue analgesic data as an outcome and reported no difference between the 
gabapentin and control groups [ 14]. 
This systematic review demonstrated that preoperative gabapentin administration 
was useful for postoperative pain management.  A single preoperative dose of 
gabapentin , [ADDRESS_896759] 24 h  after surgery.  Sedation was associated 
with its use but no serious adverse effects were observed. 
One meta -analysis [18] evaluated eighteen studies [13, 14, 19-34] encompassing 
1181 patients; mean ages ranged from [ADDRESS_896760] common

 dose of gabapentin assessed was1200 mg daily (12 studies), with some studies 
using doses as low as 300 mg daily (Table 2).    Eleven studies [13, 19-27, 32] 
administered gabapentin as a single dose within 1 h to 2 h before surgery; the 
remainder involved initiating therapy on the day before surgery or continuing it 
for up to 10 days after surgery (Table 2).  Gabapentin caused a significant reduction in postoperative pain at rest [13, 14, 19-31, 33, 34] in the first 24 h, by 
27% to 39% (7.2 mm to 14.3 mm on a scale of 0 mm to 100 mm), regardless of 
whether treatment effects were expressed as ratios of means or weighted mean 
differences.  Similarly, aside from 24 h after surgery, gabapenti n significantly 
reduced pain with movement [ 13, 14, 19, 20, 25, 28-30, 33]
 by 18% to 28% (VAS 
8.2 mm to 10.2 mm) after surgery.  Fourteen studies [14, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25-27, 
33], encompassing 1027 participants, reported effects on cumulative 24 h 
analgesic consumption.  Gabapentin resulted in a 35% reduction in total analgesic consumption over the first 24 h following surgery (ratio of means 0.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.72; P<0.001), albeit with significant heterogeneity (I2=84.4%).  The 
data on time to first analgesic was available in three studies [13, 24, 32], (171 
patients); it was delayed 7.9 min by [CONTACT_313157] (95% CI 4.2 to 11.6; P<0.001), 
with minimal heterogeneity (I2=0%).  
This meta -analysis concluded that perioperative administration of gabapentin 
reduces pain scores, both at rest and with movement following various surgeries, 
lengthens the time for analgesic rescue, decreases the consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_663994]- related side effects. The pain score at rest was reduced by 
27% to 39% (VAS 7.2 mm to 14.3 mm on a scale of 0 mm to 100 mm) during the first 24 h, and the pain score with movement was reduced by 18% to 28% (VAS 8.2 mm to 10.2 mm) in the first 12 h. 
The two meta -analyses on the topic of perioperative use of gabapentin published 
prior to P eng’s meta- analysis of 18 studies were less extensive and included only 
eight [16], and 12 [ 17] studies, respectively; therefore they are not included in this 
literature review.  
The evidence of effectiveness of gabapentin as an adjunct to reduce acute 
postoperative pain has further generated the question of whether gabapentin would also be effective in preventing chronic post -surgical pain.  A recent 
combined systematic review and meta -analysis reviewed the effectiveness of 
gabapentin and pregabalin in the perioperative period for the prevention of chronic post -surgical pain [35] and concluded that perioperative administration of 
gabapentin and pregabalin is effective in reducing the long -term incidence of 
chronic post-surgical pain.

 Other RCTs of gabapentin in the perioperative period (2010-2013)  
Clinical studies with a RCT design, published recently (2010- 2013) and not included 
in any previous meta -analyses or systematic reviews, are presented in Table 3.  Of [ADDRESS_896761] one outcome measure, while 4 studies 
had negative or inconclusive results.  The only pediatric study [11] is also included in 
Table 3.  
Based on the comprehensive literature review, which is suggestive of the efficacy of gabapentin for nociceptive acute postoperative pain, we propose that the nociceptive pain encountered in the VOC crisis could also be responsive to the addition of gabapentin to the other two classes of medications representing the current standard 
of care, opi[INVESTIGATOR_173671]- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs.  
Based on evidence that a single dose regimen has better analgesic efficacy than multi -
dose regimens, we proposed a single dose  of gabapentin of 15mg/kg, maximum 
900mg.

 There is emerging evidence that patients with SCD experience neuropathic 
pain as a component of their acute pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Allodynia and hyperalgesia are symptoms commonly experienced by [CONTACT_664032]  [55]. In one survey of adult patients see n at 
a SCD specialty clinic, 90% of 145 patients verbalized pain descriptors 
consistent with neuropathic pain [ 56
]. Another evaluation of 56 SCD patients 
age >14 years revealed that 40% experienced definite or probable neuropathic 
pain. Only 4% of patients were receiving treatment directed at neuropathic pain [
57].  No formal studies have been completed using gabapentin in patients 
with SCD.  
 Based on the evidence suggesting that patients with SCD experience 
neuropathic pain, the analgesic benefit of gabapentin demonstrated in the acute 
pain setting , and the limited length of time that patie nts stay in the acute care 
setting  for pain management for VOC, we propose an intervention consisting 
of a single dose gabapentin of 15 mg/kg, as soon as possible after presentation 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], in addition to the current standard of practice which inc ludes 
the use of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527] a non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drug for pain in 
VOC.  
 
Age-appropriate pain assessment tools are used in our institution as per the 
pain standard of care: the Faces, Legs, Arms, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) 
pain scale for children younger than 4 years [58], Wong Baker FACES for 
children 4 to 6 years [59, 60], and NRS for those 7 years or older [ 61, 62]. 
The FLACC scale is a 5 item scale that raters use to score each of the 5 
categories: F (faces), L (legs), A (activity), C (cry), and C (consolability), which are scores from 0 to 2 (Merkel 1997). The reliability and validity data on the FLACC tool are extensive [58, 63-65].  
 The Wong Baker FACES is a horizontal scale of 6 hand- drawn faces, now 
scored from 0 to 10, that range from a smiling “no hurt” face on the left to a crying “hurts worst” face on the right [60]; faces pain scales have been used in 
numerous to measure acute, procedural and recurrent pain, as reported in a 
systematic review of faces scales for the self -report of pain intensity in 
children [66].  The Wong Baker FACES has adequate psychometric properties, 
and it is easy and quick to use [60, 66, 67] and inexpensive to reproduce.  The 
greatest strength of this is its acceptability; studies have consistently found that the WBFPRS was preferred by [CONTACT_664033], parents, and practitioners, 
when compared with other faces pain scales [68-70].  In a systematic review of 
the psyc hometric properties, interpretability and feasibility of self -report pain

2.[ADDRESS_896765] includes the following:  
a. The concept of “rational poly -pharmacy”, which supports the concurrent 
use of drugs with distinctly different mechanisms of action to produce 
analgesia [30, 71].  Gabapentin- related analgesia is based on a different 
mechanism of action (at the α-2-δ subunit of the voltage -dependent 
calcium channel) than opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269] (mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_663998]) 
and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (cyclooxygenase inhibition);  
b. Proven analgesic efficacy in the acute pain setting of postoperative p ain in 
adults [ 13, 14] and children  [11].  Additional evidence is provided in the 
literature review section of the background, based on 43 references. 
c. Evidence that one of the mechanisms of acute pain in the VOC may be a neuropathic mechanism, based on demonstration of hyperalgesia and 
allodynia in animal models of sickle cell disease  [72, 73]; hyperalgesia and 
allodynia are clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain;  
d. Evidence that t he combination of opi[INVESTIGATOR_663999], in the context of chronic pain [ 30];  
Repetitive VOC events and associated acute pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], like any other 
repetitive pain events, may contribute to the development of neuroplasticity 
and central sensitization. The neuronal phenomena of neuroplasticity and central sensitiza tion are responsive to therapy with gabapentin [ 74-78] .  
Furthermore, there is evidence from animal studies that gabapentin is more 
effective in modulating nocicep tive transmission in the presence of 
inflammation  [74] and central sensitization [75], and the potency of the

Protocol document date : 06-20-[ADDRESS_896766] is directly related to the intensity of sensitization  [76].  
The presence of both phenomena  of inflammation and neuropathic pain 
mechanisms has been supported by [CONTACT_664034][INVESTIGATOR_664000]  
[73], and pain has been found to be related to a mechanism of ischemia and 
reperfusion injury, which exacerbates hyperalgesia  [72].  Based on t he 
contribution of neuroplasticity and central sensitization in the development of 
pain in repetitive VOC epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  [12] and the evidence of efficacy of 
gabapentin in modulating nociceptive mechanisms associated with 
inflammation and central sensitization, we expect a n intervention with 
gabapentin for VOC pain to provide analgesic efficacy.

Upon each participant’s enrollment, study st aff will randomize the participant 
to one of 2 possible treatment arms (see section 11 for randomization 
procedure) and order the study treatment.  The pharmacy will dispense the 
dose of study treatment (gabapentin vs. placebo) to the clinic or medicine ro om 
as soon as possible.   
 
Study drug and other interventions will be administered and documented according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664002].  All caregivers 
and study personnel  will be blinded to the treatment assignment.  Based on 
previous research experience at St. Jude, administration of the study drug is 
estimated to occur no later than 2 hours after patient’s first opi[INVESTIGATOR_664003] .

 seizures is not known. Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans; 
pharmacological effects are from the activity of the parent compound. It is 
eliminated unchanged in the urine. Patients with renal impairment should have 
dosage adjustments. Administr ation with food has little effect on absorption of 
gabapentin.  In a single -dose gabapentin pharmacokinetics study in healthy 
infants and children, the mean maximum concentration was achieved 2.31 
hours after a single oral dose in 48 children ages 1 month to 12 years of age. 
Dosing for 1 month to 2 years of age of the immediate -release gabapentin 
syrup was 10 mg/kg. Dosing for children greater than 2 years of age of the 
immediate -release capsules was based on weight and ranged from 8 mg/kg to 
12.5 mg/kg as follows: 200 mg for 16 to 25 kg; 300 mg for 26 to 36 kg; 400 
mg for 37 to 50 kg . The mean maximum concentrations were 3.74 mcg/mL for 
< 5 years of age (n=27) and 4.52 mcg/mL for ≥ 5 years of age (n=21). The 
single dose of gabapentin was well tolerated with seven participants reporting mild treatment- associated adverse events. The adverse  events included 
asthenia, truncal ataxia, dizziness, drowsiness, somnolence, and vomiting [ 79].  
 
Formulation and Stability: Gabapentin is supplied as an oral suspension 
containing 100 mg/mL . The St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664007] (Appendix IV). The oral suspension is stable for 3 months under 
refrigerated conditions between 2 and 8°C (36 and 46°F).  The oral suspe nsion

occurring  after the administration of study drug will be captured for this 
study, as sickle cell patients may have steady -state or pre -existing values that 
fall in the range of toxicity per the CTCAE (e.g. anemia, fever, pain).  
Worsening pain scores after enrollment will not be captured or reported  as 
AEs, but will be managed clinically.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664011]/reported as an AE.

disease experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting. The primary 
study objective is to assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin for pain during VOC 
in participants with SCD, by [CONTACT_664048] a decrease 
of ≥ 33% in pain scores between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment 
at [ADDRESS_896788] administration of study drug, in the gabapentin and placebo groups. The 
intention- to-treat principle will be followed and all eligible, randomized subjects will 
be analyzed in the primary analysis as randomized.  
 
11.1 Sample size  
 
Retrospective review of 26 months of records (August 1, 2010 to October 1, 2012) indicated that 137 patients, ages 1-18, experienced VOC due to SCD and 
were administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We  analyzed the pain scores from a subset of 40 
patients between the ages of 8 and 18 who had received opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480](s) and also had 
pain scores documented at baseline and end of the visit . We found a reduction 
in the pain scores  from baseline to discharge or admission of ≥ 33% [ 81-83] in 
45% of patients (18/40). The hypothesis is that treatment with gabapentin ha s 
better analgesic efficacy than placebo in the treatment of pain during VOC, when added to the current standard of care for pain during VOC which comprises opi[INVESTIGATOR_173671]- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. An increase in 
the proportion of patients with ≥ 33% reduction of the pain scores from 45% to 
at least 65% between presentation and assessment at [ADDRESS_896789] 
administration of study drug is considered clinically meaningful [81-83]. 
 
Let P
t and P c be the proportions of participants  with a decrease of ≥ 33% in 
pain scores between presentation to the acute care setting (ACS) and [ADDRESS_896790] study drug administration , in the gabapentin and placebo groups,

parameters of a type I error rate ( α) of 0.05 and a type II error rate ( β) of 0.2, 
assuming one interim analys is and ∆ = 0.2 under H 1, we will need a total of 
166 patients (83 per group) for our two sample test. The interim analysis will 
be conducted to assess efficacy and futility, when there are 96 subjects 
randomized. We will recommend that the trial will be halted for efficacy (in 
favor of H 1) if the nominal p -value for the interim analysis is less than or equal 
to 0.0143. We will recommend the trial should be halted for futil ity (in favor of 
H0) if the nominal p -value for the interim analysis is greater than or equal to 
0.2249. If H 0 is true, this interim analysis has a 79% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_664020] H 0. If H 1 is true, this interim analysis has a 53% probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_664021] H 1. To account for the planned interim analysis, the final 
analysis will be at the nominal p -value of 0.0447; thus maintaining the overall 
type I error rate at 0.05. This plan is based on the binomial two- sample 
difference in proportions  with a non- binding interim analysis based on power 
family spending functions with alpha and beta spending parameters set to 0.1 (EAST software v5.3).

11.3 Statistical analysis 
 
11.3.1 Primary Objective  
 
To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin (vs. placebo) for pain during 
VOC in participants with SCD. A response to study drug will be defined by a decrease in pain score of ≥33% between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at [ADDRESS_896794] administration of study drug  is 33% or 
greater, then this patient will be defined as having a successful intervention. The proportions of successful interventions in the gabapentin and placebo 
groups will be estimated and compared using Z -test (PROC FREQ procedure 
in SAS).   
11.3.2  Secondary Objective  
 
To compare the t otal morphine dose or morphine equivalent (mg/kg) used to 
control pain during VOC between presentation to the acute care setting and 
assessment at [ADDRESS_896795] administration of study drug in the gabapentin vs. 
placebo groups .  
 
Summary statistics of the total morphine dose or morphine equivalent (mg/kg) 
used to control pain during VOC between presentation to the acute care setting 
and [ADDRESS_896796] will be 
applied to the total morphine dose or morphine equivalent (mg/kg) to examine their deviation from the normal distribution. A two- sample t -test or Wilcoxon 
rank sum test will be used to compare the total morphine dose or morphine 
equivalent (mg/kg) for the gabapentin vs. placebo groups depending on 
whether the normality assumption of the data holds.

4. To compare the change in pain score from time of administration of study drug to assessment at [ADDRESS_896797] administration of study drug in the 
gabapentin vs. placebo groups. 
 
The numeric changes in pain scores will be compared using the statistical methods of the secondary objective.  Changes in pain score will also be evaluated as a proportion of those with a decrease of ≥33% and analyzed 
by [CONTACT_664050].

Sickle Cell Research:  
Pain Crisis Study  
St. Jude doctors want to know if a medicine that is helpful for some cancer pain  
and surgery pain could also help sickle cell pain in young patients.  
 
Who:   Any St. Jude patient with sickle cell disease and a new pain 
crisis, between  1-21  years old 
Where:   The study takes place only at St. Jude, in the clinic or 
medicine room during a pain crisis.  
How:   When you arrive for your pain appointment, you may be 
asked if you would like to participate.  A parent or legal guardian 
must be here to sign  consent to participate.  
What:   Eligible patients will receive study drug by [CONTACT_664052].  The rest of the pain 
crisis visit is the same as usual.  You will be asked for a pain score 3 
hours after taking the study drug, either in person or by [CONTACT_648]. Also, you will receive $25 for your participation . 
 
Want to know more?  Ask your sickle cell team for more information at any time.  
You may also call  during b usiness hours to talk to the 
study team for details about the study.

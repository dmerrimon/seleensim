Study Title : AAAS2529  (M01Y01): Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246357] (ASP IRE): A 
Double-Blind RCT of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246358] : The overarching objective of this clinical trial is treatmen t of exercise-induced 
overheating in persons with RRMS.  
 Primary Outcome Measure: Time -to-exhaustion   [Time Frame: from start of exercise test until self -reported exhaustion, up to 
30 minutes] 
• Duration of time exercising before reaching peak exertion, defined as cadence drop below 40 
RPM for >/= [ADDRESS_299650] termination criteria.  
 Secondary Outcome Measures : 
Exercise -induced body temperature increase   [Time Frame: from start of exercise test until self -
reported exhaustion, up to 30 minutes]  
• Change in body temperature from pre- to post- maximal exercise test  
 
1. Aim 1a. Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246359] (ASA) will result in longer Time to Exhaustion (TTE). 
2. Aim 1b. Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, ASA will result in reduced exercise -induced 
body temperature increase.  
3. Aim 2a. Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, Acetaminophen (APAP) will result in longer 
TTE.  
4. Aim 2b. Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, APAP will re sult in reduced exercise- induced 
body temperature increase 
 
Design  and Outcomes:  
This study is a prospective, single -center, blinded, within- subject effectiveness study in patients 
diagnosed with RRMS. The study will enroll at least 60 patients. The study will entail 3 study 
visits, separated by [CONTACT_246392] 7 days.  
 The study design consists of: 
• Within -subject crossover placebo -controlled experiment with [ADDRESS_299651] serves as her/his own control.  
• This is a Phase 3 study.  
 
The study outcomes are listed as follows: 
• Aim 1 uses a two -armed crossover trial to assess differences in outcomes between ASA and 
placebo; unpaired t -tests will be used to test within -subject differences in outcomes between 
session 1 and session 2.  
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_246355] 1.0 
Version date 01/March/2019 
Page 9 of 41 • Aim 2 uses a two -armed crossover trial to assess differences in outcomes between APAP and 
placebo ; analytic approach is identical to Aim 1.  
• A sub -analysis of Aim 2 uses a n ANOVA to assess difference in outcomes among three 
treatments (ASA, APAP, placebo). All variables will be inspected for outliers or inconsistent 
values. Variables that display an extremely right skewed distribution with outliers will be transformed using log transformation. Any remaining outlier values will be winsorized, i.e. extreme values will be censored down to the nearest non-outlier value.  
  
Interventions and Duration 
• This study will utilize a crossover assignment.   
• This study has a 24- month time line beginning when the study opens enrollment through 
the completion of data analyses.  
• Each subject will be on study for anywhere between 3 and 12 weeks, depending on the 
scheduling of each exercise session.  
• Enrollment is expected to remain open throughout the course of the study until the target goal of 60 completed participants has been reached . 
• Interventions in this  study include a 650 mg dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], acetaminophen, and placebo 
to be taken orally one hour prior to each exercise session.  
  
Sample Size and Population 
 
• 60 persons randomized 
• Persons with current diagnosis of RRMS (2010 McDonald criteria) 
o Pi[INVESTIGATOR_246360]; 
Patients with progressive MS may experience exercise- induced exhaustion for 
different reasons (e.g., increased physical disability); This study limits recruitment to RRMS where pi[INVESTIGATOR_246361] a priori hypothesis suggest greatest benefits. 
• Persons aged 18 to 65 years 
o Consistent with observations that 75% of relapse -onset MS patients are diagnosed 
between ages 20 and 50, with a mean onset at 30 years, these limits ensure that our sample is representative of the relapse- onset MS population; Upper limit is set to 
reduce effects of age- related activity -level decreases.  
• Self-reported heat -sensitivity to exercise  
• Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) total score ≤ 6.0 
o Patients with higher EDSS scores may experience exercise-induced exhaustion for different reasons (e.g., increased physical disability) 
• Exacerbation -free (and no use of corticosteroids) for 6 weeks prior to enrollment 
o To avoid any transitory changes in disability related to current disease activity  
• BMI ≤ 35 
o To reduce health -related confounds of obesity.

2 BACKGROUND  
 2.1 Rationale Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent and chronic neurologic disease that impacts 
individuals on many levels. Exercise holds a multitude of benefits for persons with MS (PwMS ), 
including improved physical function, reduced fatigue, improved mood, and improved cognition. 
There is now evidence from pre- clinical models for neural -level benefits of exercise including 
increased BDNF, and reduced myelin and axonal damage. But exercise only works if people do it, and many PwMS are deterred from exercising by [CONTACT_246393], exhaustion, and symptom worsening: “Uhthoff’s phenomenon.” Our group extended Uhthoff’s observation by [CONTACT_246394] -ever report of elevated resting body temperature and its link to worse fatigue in persons 
with MS; that is, even before exercise, PwMS are already “heated up.” This R21 will support a 
trial of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246362] a pretreatment for exercise: our pi[INVESTIGATOR_246363] [ADDRESS_299652] with three arms: placebo, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and acetaminophen (APAP). Design is crossover: each parti cipant 
will complete three exercise sessions separated by [ADDRESS_299653] adult dose (one 650-mg capsule) of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], APAP, or placebo. One hour later (time to reach p eak serum level) 
participants will complete a progressive ramped maximal exercise test on a lower body cycle 
ergometer. Body temperature and biophysical/behavioral variables (VO2max, total watts 
achieved, blood pressure, anaerobic threshold, ratings of per ceived exertion) will be recorded 
throughout the test at regular intervals. Past research in MS has found cooling treatments 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_246355] 1.0 
Version date 01/March/2019 
Page 13 of 41 (cooling garments, vacuum hand-cooling chambers) effective for improving exercise 
performance. However, their widespread adoption f or research / clinical use is limited by 
[CONTACT_246395]. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a simple, readily available, cost- effective 
treatment that does not require FDA approval. If successful, this R21 grant may motivate change in clinical care and adoption of ASA therapy for enhancing exercise performance in PwMS. Positive findings from this study will facilitate future research to test whether ASA use improves exercise adherence, increases everyday physical activity levels, and improves overall QOL for 
persons with MS. 
 ASA was selected as the agent for use in the current study because: a) it was safe and 
effective in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; b) prior (non-exercise) studies in MS have shown efficacy of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246364], and c) prior work in MS supports its favorable safety profile.[6, 8, 9] In those 3 
RCTs, no adverse events were reported, and side effects were minimal (i.e., did not differ 
appreciably from those reported by [CONTACT_246396]). Importantly, the daily dosage of ASA in those studies (1300 mg/day, for 6 weeks) was much higher than the dosage we will use here (650 mg/1 time administration). In the long term, adoption of ASA as a pre-
treatment for exercise would only require the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246365]- needed (PRN) basis, thereby 
[CONTACT_246397][INVESTIGATOR_248]’s side effects. The safety profile for acetaminophen 
(APAP) is similarly favorable, and patients with any contraindication to APAP use (e.g., severe active hepatic disease, Hepatitis C Virus) will be excluded  from the study. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_299654] research in MS has found cooling treatments (cooling garments, vacuum hand-cooling 
chambers) effective for improving exercise performance. However, their widespread adoption 
for research / clinical use is limited by [CONTACT_246395]. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a simple, readily available, cost -effective treatment that does not require FDA approval. If 
successful, this R21 grant may motivate change in clinical care and adoption of ASA therapy for

research to test whether ASA use improves exercise adherence, increases everyday physical activity levels, and improves overall QOL for persons with MS. 
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessme nt 
Risks:  
The risks posed by [CONTACT_246398].  Three doses of 650mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246366], with no adverse events noted. In addition, physicians 
serving as investigators on this study will work closely during recruitment to ensure that there are no counter indications to one-time aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246367]. Additionally, a study 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_246355] 1.0 
Version date 01/March/2019 
Page 14 of 41 physician will be available during all exercise sessions and will review all stress tests for any 
evidence of cardiovascular disease/ischemic changes.  
Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver 
transplant and death. Most cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen 
doses that exceed the recommended maximum daily limits, and often involve more than one acetaminophen -containing product. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with 
acetaminophen been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver were 
nausea, vomiting, headache, and insomnia in adult patients and nausea, transplant and death. 
Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with vomiting, constipation, pruritus, agitation, and atelectasis in pediatric patients.  
 
The minimal risks in the study are related to a) ASA/APAP use (which will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_246399], and the dosage is a single-dose administration 
of the standard adult dose (650mg), and prior ASA trials in MS using this dose twice daily for 6 weeks reported no adverse events and found minimal side effects that did not differ from the placebo con dition), and b) discomforts of exercise-induced overheating and exhaustion (which 
will be minimal, as the exercise test is only about 9 minutes in duration, and we anticipate will be ameliorated in the ASA/APAP conditions). These minimal risks are easily managed, and will be closely monitored; as such, the risk/benefit ratio is very favorable.  
A certified exercise physiologist will conduct all exercise tests after subjects have been carefully 
screened (in consultation with Co- I [CONTACT_246423], MD, and in consul tation with Co -I [CONTACT_192093] , MD ) 
to ensure no counter indications to ASA use or to participating in a supervised exercise session involving stationery cycling. All exercise tests are conducted by [CONTACT_246400]/BCLS certified exercise physiologist, ( Nancy Lee, MS ) at Columbia University Medical Center in the 
presence of a physician. Subjects will be briefed in detail about what they will experience during the exercise sessions.  
  
Benefits : 
 While participants may not benefit directly, participation in research may benefit the community, specifically the MS community. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_299655] aspi[INVESTIGATOR_246368]. Positive findings from this study will potentially provide an effective, inexpensive, readily available, unobtrusive treatment that will avail more persons with RRMS the benefits of exercise. As such, there are potentially far

3 STUDY DESIGN  
• Design is a within -subject crossover placebo- controlled experiment; subjects will be 
randomized to one of six sequences (see figure) by [CONTACT_246401]- blind until data collection ceases. Each participant will attend three exercise 
sessions scheduled on separate days separated by ≥one-week intervals. Exercise sessions will be scheduled at the same time of day (±1 hour), and between the hours of 10 am-5 pm to reduce the influence of circadian rhythm variability  
• Design is crossover: each participant will complete three exercise sessions separated by 1-week intervals. At each session, body temperature will be measured before administration of a standard adult dose (one 650-mg capsule) of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], APAP, or placebo. One hour later (time to reach peak serum level) participants will complete a progressive ramped maximal exercise test on a lower body cycle ergometer. Body temperature and biophysical/behavioral variables (VO2max, total watts achieved, blood pressure, anaerobic threshold, ratings of perceived exertion) will be recorded throughout the test at regular intervals.

4.5 Study Enrollment Procedures  
 
Recruitment:  
 
Sixty patients with RRMS will be recruited from the Multiple Sclero sis Clinical Care and 
Research Center at the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) . This  center currently sees 
about forty new MS patients each month, adding to an already large census of MS patients 
treated at the center annually (approximately 900 patients per year, 60% RRMS). Given the rapid recruitment for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] [n=12 patients; total pi[INVESTIGATOR_246370] (recruitment, enrollment, study 
completion) = 4 months], there is no  anticipate d difficulty to meet  recruitment goals over the 2-
year period of this proposed project. We will screen 100 patients, estimating that 60% of screened patients will meet eligibility. Co -I [CONTACT_246423] (Medical Director of the MS Center) and 
the research coordinator will lead patient recruitment and confirm the disease- speci fic inclusion 
criteria.  
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leavitt sees patients at the Center weekly in her role as clinical 
neuropsychologist, and therefore has an opportunity to identify potential research subjects who will be ref erred to the study. We do not anticipate any issue with retention, given that the entire 
duration of study participation is 3 study visits spread over about 3 weeks’ time.  Enrollment will 
not be closed until all [ADDRESS_299662] completed all three visits; this will ensure 60 completed participants ar e enrolled in this study. 
If the patient's treating physician feels the subject may be a good fit for this study based 
on observations of overheating, fatigue or difficulty with exercising, s/he may discuss the trial with the patient to gauge interest. If the patient is interested in the trial, the treating physician may have a study coordinator or other study personnel meet with the patient to discuss the trial in further detail and answer questions. A screener (attached in Documents) will be reviewed with

Version date 01/March/2019 
Page 19 of 41 the potential participant to ensure criteria are met. If the patient meets criteria and wishes to 
participate, study personnel will begin the consenting process.  
Patients will be referred by [CONTACT_102]'s treating physician, many from Drs. Leavitt, Riley  
and De Jager, who are investigators on this protocol. All other patients will be referred either by 
[CONTACT_246404]. Leavitt, all of whom work at the Columbia University Medical Center , or from 
providers outside CUMC whose patients have seen study flyers and have reached out to a study team member directly to convey  interest in the study . 
Participants may be recruited via person -to-person methods, as well as via flyers and 
handouts. All  recruitment methods are IRB approved before implementation. 
 
Procedures for Obtaining Informed Consent:  
 This study utiliz es both in-person consenting and e-consent.  
 E-consent is  done via RedCap, a secure online database. A copy of the e- consent form as  a 
Redcap -generated PDF is attached to this protocol to attest to it being identical to the print-
version. We will offer the e-consent to in-person participants as a way to replace the signing of a paper -based informed consent as a way to best address the participant's needs or preferences. 
This is optional and a paper copy will always be available. The e-consent will show the same pages as the traditional paper consent. The potential research participant will then use this e-consent to fill out the same signature [CONTACT_246420]. Once the participant signs the consent and hits submit, a PDF of the completed consent will be generated and can be emailed to both the participant and the study coordinator. For both in-person and remote e-consenting, study personnel will abide by [CONTACT_246405]. For e-consent, study personnel will plan a phone call with each potential participant to discuss the consent form and study in detail, allowing for each participant to ask any questions prior to signing on the online ICF. Study personnel will confirm the participant's identity by [CONTACT_246406]'s full name [CONTACT_246421] e-consent process. This process is in compliance with the requirements of [ADDRESS_299663] 
copy. For e-consent, PDF versions of the signed form may be generated and a copy may be sent to both the study coordinator and the participant who has consented. Study coordinators will keep a printout copy of this PDF on file throughout the duration of the study.

 Patients may be re-screened if they screen fail as a result of the following 
Inclusion/Exclus ion Criteria:  
• Exacerbation -free (and no use of corticosteroids) for 6 weeks prior to enrollment 
• BMI ≤ 40 
• Uncontrolled syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, or nasal polyps 
 If the patient later meets these criteria, they may be re- screened.  All screen failures will be 
documented in the Screening Log alongside successful screenings. Patients may be re- screened if they are a screen fail as a result of any of the Lifestyle 
Considerations (See Section 4.3).  
4.5.[ADDRESS_299665] Recruitment and Retention 
 
Sixty patients with RRMS will be recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Center at CUMC. With approximately 900 patients seen per year, 60% of that 
population has a current RRMS diagnosis. This center additionally sees about 40 new patients each month. Therefore, this study does not anticipate difficulty meeting enrollment goals over the 2 -year period. 100 patients will be screened , estimating that 60% of screened patients will 
meet eligibility.

participant’s study visit must be moved to another date within the allotted 1- 4 week 
window.  
• For any patients on interferon therapy, exercise sessions will not be scheduled within [ADDRESS_299671]- injection, as injection -related flu -like symptoms may compromise exercise 
tolerance.  
• If a patient experiences an MS exacerbation within 4 weeks of her/his scheduled enrollment, the study visit will be rescheduled for 4 weeks following resolution of the exacerbation (See Inclusion Criteria, Section 4.1). 
  
6.2.1 On-Study/On- Interventions Evaluations/procedures  
After a participant has been cleared to participate in the study by [CONTACT_5657]/her physician and study 
personnel, the participant will sign the informed consent form (either a paper copy, in person, or an online e-Consent).   
Study personnel will then schedule study visits with the participant. Each participant will attend 
three study visits separated  by ≥ one- week ( ≤ 4 weeks). Specific procedures conducted are 
outlined in Section 6.1. 
 Exercise sessions will be scheduled for the same time of day (±1 hour), between the hours of [ADDRESS_299672] udy visit is estimated to 
take approximately 2 hours total. Participants will refrain from eating for two hours prior to their session.   Study drug will be obtained from the Research Pharmacy and will be available to the participant upon arrival at Study Visit 1.  Body temperature will be measured with a tympanic thermometer 
(right ear; Braun Thermoscan IRT).   Participants will receive one of three treatments at each session prior to the exercise test. Order of treatment will be randomized and counter- balanced, with each participant serving as his/her 
own control. Treatment will be administered as one capsule containing 650mg (i.e., standard adult dose for ASA and APAP) of ASA, APAP, or placebo; t ime of administration will be 
recorded. Exercise will not beg in until 1 hour after the participant has taken the study drug in 
order to allow peak serum level to be reached . During this 1-hour waiting period, participants 
will complete the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246376] (HADS)  and Fatigue Severity Scale 
(FSS)  to characterize the sample; the Paffen barger Physical Activity Scale  for post-hoc 
evaluation of physical activity levels; and the following: day of last menstrual cycle (if female), number of hours slept prior night, any physical/outdoor activities engaged in today, presence of illness in self or family members today; and visual analog scales (VAS) of pain, fatigue, and sadness. Participants will be familiarized with Borg’s ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) CR10 scale for breathing (RPEbr) and legs (RPEl eg), consistent with Collett et al and the thermal 
sensation scale (ASHRAE scale)  to be completed by [CONTACT_79199] 60-second intervals

The exercise session portion of each study visit will use the following tools:  Exercise test s will be conducted by [CONTACT_246408] a physician to ensure safety. All exercise testing equipment is current and certified for use with human subjects. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is performed using Vmax Encore Metabolic Cart (CareFusion Corp, San Diego, CA). Echocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is done with a twelve- lead system attached to the Vmax Encore Metabolic Cart with 
cardiosoft software (CareFusion Corp). Maximum aerobic fitness (VO2max) w ill be measured 
by [CONTACT_246409] a VIAsprint 150P electronic- braked cycle ergometer 
(CareFusion Corp). Each subject will have peak ventilatory capacity (Maximum Voluntary Ventilation, MVV) determined before exercise test via Vmax Encore S ystem (CareFusion Corp). 
Flow sensor and gas analyzer will be calibrated against known medical grade gases before each test. VO2max will be determined from peak 20- second average of breath -by-breath measurement 
of VO2. Anaerobic threshold will be determined for each subject using the V-slope technique  The exercise session portion of each study visit will occur as follows:  Each subject will complete a [ADDRESS_299673]’s weight and exercise profile. This rampi[INVESTIGATOR_246377].  
Patients will maintain a cadence of 50 -60 revolutions per minute (RPM) for test duration. The 
test is terminated when cadence drops below 40 RPM for ≥ 5 seconds, or when participant 
reaches volitional exhaustion in accordance with American Thoracic Societ y (ATS) standard test 
termination criteria.  Throughout the test, RPE and HR will be recorded every 60 sec. Blood 
pressure (BP) and ear temperature will be recorded every 2 minutes. At termination, RPE, BP, and ear temperature will be recorded, as well as m inute ventilation, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (O2), carbon 
dioxide (CO2), watts, RER, and total time. VAS of fatigue and Global Fatigue Change (GFC) will be recorded.  
 To test effectiveness of blinding, participants will be asked which condition they think they were in at the end of each session.

6.3.8 Additional Evaluations  
 7 MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EXPERIENCES  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or device.  FDA, Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), and Columbia University Medical Center IRB requirements for reporting AEs will be followed. Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the time they sign consent until 30 days following permanent discontinuation of study drug. At that point, all ongoing AEs will be followed to resolution, but no new AEs will be recorded. The IMM/DSMB will review cumulative AEs; the frequency of this review will be determined by [CONTACT_145858]/DSMB in conjunction with the Protocol PI. 
 
8  MANAGEMENT OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
An Unanticipated Problem (UP), per the Columbia University Medical Center IRB, is defined as: “any incident, experience or outcome involving risk to subjects or others in any hum an subjects 
research that meets all of the following criteria:  
A. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the IRB-approval protocol and informed consent document, and (b) 
the characteri stics of the subject population being studied; 
B. related or possibly related to participation in such research (i.e., there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_246410]); and  
C. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.” 
 Per CIRB reporting guidelines, UPs will be reported if they require changes to the protocol due to added risk to participants. All participants will be notified of any protocol changes and will be reconsented as appropriate. If an UP does not pose additional risk to participants and does not require changes made to the protocol, the UP may be reported as an Adverse Event.

Page 29 of 41 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
Statistical methods recommended for the proper analysis of crossover trial data will be used (for 
details, see Wellek and Blettner).  Our primary ou tcomes evaluate differences between treatment 
condition (ASA, APAP and placebo) with respect to (a) TTE (that is, length of time spent exercising) and (b) increase in exercise- induced body temperature (°F). Differences between 
pretreatment conditions (ASA, APAP, placebo) will be analysed separately by [CONTACT_246411] (ie, stepwise assessment of outcome differences across six possible sequences). Although significant differences in outcome variables between ASA and APAP a re not anticipated, we are interested in seeing how they compare in the full analyses. A 
mixed -effects linear model will be used to account for repeated measurements of each outcome, 
period effect, sequence effect and carryover effect. Using mixed -effects linear model will enable 
us to model differences in outcomes both within and between patients (intrapatient and interpatient variability). If assumptions for mixed- effects linear model are not met and log transformation is 
not appropriate, non- linear  mixed -effects models will be used. Moreover, exploratory analyses 
will examine potential pretreatment differences for additional outcome measures, such as physiological indices (eg, HR, BP) and behavioural self-reports (eg, RPEs, fatigue, pain).  
9.2 Outcomes  
 9.2.1 Primary Outcome 
Primary outcomes are total time to exhaustion (TTE) measured at exercise cessation and change 
in temperature from baseline (pre- exercise) to exercise cessation.  
9.2.2 Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes: Borg’s ratings of perceived exertion scale (RPE) for breathing (RPEbr) and muscle fatigue (RPEleg) collected every [ADDRESS_299677]; 10- point visual analog scales (VAS) of pain (VAS -P) and fatigue 
(VAS -F) measured pre- and post- exercise test; and physiological measures: heart rate (HR), 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), expO
2, peak minute ventilation, maximum 
watts, and RER. 
 
  
9.[ADDRESS_299678] sizes for both outcomes (time to exhaustion/TTE and 
body temperature) were very large (Cohen’s d=1.45). Here, we conservatively estimated medium -
sized effects (0.5) to calculate a power estimate for the proposed trial. With significance set at α=0.[ADDRESS_299679], a t hree-arm crossover sample of 54 will yield 0.95 power to 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_246355] 1.0 
Version date 01/March/[ADDRESS_299680] differences between interventions. Our plan to enroll 60 participants allows for 10% 
attrition, which accounts for both participant drop-out as well as exclusion due to relapses. 
9.[ADDRESS_299681] (DSMB) appointed by [CONTACT_18121]/NINDS will meet at six -month intervals (or as determined by [CONTACT_194304]) to review 
partially unblinded study data provided by [CONTACT_4305].  This committee will monitor rates of adverse events and endpoints in the tria l and will monitor the performance of the trial. The 
frequency and format of DSMB meetings, reports, and guidelines for interim analysis will be agreed upon prior to study subject enrollment. 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or device.  FDA, Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), and Columbia University Medical Center IRB requirements for reporting AEs will be followed. Subjects will be monitored for AEs 
from the time they sign consent until 30 days following permanent discontinuation of study drug. At that p oint, all ongoing AEs will be followed to resolution, but no new AEs will be recorded. 
The IMM/ DSMB will review cumulative AEs; the frequency of this review will be determined by

She will work in close consultation with Co-I Stein, who will oversee the certified exercise physiologist who conducts all exercise tests, and Co -I Riley, who will ensure the suitability of all potential participants for 
the study. Should any of the following specific events occur, a participant would be precluded from continuing the intervention: adverse reaction to exercise test, adverse reaction to any treatment condition (ASA, APAP, placebo), patient desire to discontinue participation for any reason. If any medication-related issues are noted during the study (e.g., allergic reactions or

10.4 Adverse Experience Reporting  
The adverse event (AE) definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply with 
all applicable [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  The Site Investigator will carefully monitor each subject throughout the study for possible adverse events.  All AEs will be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  It is important to report all AEs, especially those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether serious or non -
serious. 
Any adverse events (AE), serious adverse events, or unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others occurring during the exercise test will be immediately reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leavitt to the NIH program officer according to the following timetable: deaths related to study participation 
(though not anticipated) will be reported no later than within [ADDRESS_299685] learning of the death. Unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leavitt to her program officer within 10 business days of the study team becoming aware of the SAE. All AEs and SAEs that are deemed expected and/or unrelated to the study will be submitted in a summary to NIH program officer with the annual progress report. Any protocol violations that 
occur will be submitted with the annual progress report. All documentation submitted to the NIH PO will be prepared in accordance with NIH guidelines for documentation of Reportable Events. 
In the event of any adverse events, [CONTACT_246424] will work closely with Drs. Stein and Riley to ensure 
appropriate clinical management of the participant. [CONTACT_246424] will provide written 
documentation, conduct a complete investigation, and follow-up on any/all possible study- related 
AEs. Any AEs will be reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leavitt to the Institutional Review Board and clinicaltrials.gov. [CONTACT_246424] will be responsible for describing and adhering to the procedures for identifying, monitoring, and reporting reportable events as outlined in the Protection of Human Subjects section of this application.

An adverse event is defined as : “…an unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease 
associated with a subject’s participation in this research trial.”  
 
Serious adverse events  include those events that:  “result in death; are life -threatening; require 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; cre ate persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defects.”  
 
Unexpected adverse event  is defined as any adverse experience…the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the risks described in the protocol.  
 
Expected adverse events  are those that are known to be associated with or have the potential to 
arise as a consequence of participation in the study.  
 
 On-line Adverse Event Reporting System  
  
• Within 24 hours  (of learning of the event), investigators must report any Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) Investigators must report all other AEs within 5 working days/7 calendar days  (of 
learning of the event). 
 
Serious adverse events : The site investigator determines causa lity (definitely not related, probably 
not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the adverse event. The IMM will review the SAE report.  The IMM may request further information if necessary.  The Online Adverse Event Reporting System maintains audit trails and stores data (and data updated) and 
communication related to any adverse event in the study.  The IMM may determine that the Serious Adverse Event requires expedited reporting to the FDA.  The DCC will prepare a Medwatch s afety 
report for submission to the FDA.  If warranted, the IMM will notify the DSMB chair.  The DSMB may suggest changes to the protocol or consent form to the Study Chair as a consequence of adverse events.  
 
Non-serious adverse events : Non -serious adverse events that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_92685] a member of his research team will be submitted to the DCC in a timely fashion (within 5 working days). The events will be presented in tabular form and given to the IMM on a quarterly basis or as requested. Local site investigators are also required to fulfill all reporting requirements of their local institutions.  
 The DCC will prepare aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not serious, expected/unexpected and relationship to study drug) for review. A separate report detailing

or as requested. The research team will then evaluate whether the protocol or informed consent document requires revision based on the reports.   
10.4.1 Definitions of Adverse Events, Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions & Serious 
Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically si gnificant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or device.  
 Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs can be classified as suspected ADRs, 
if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  
 Examples of adverse events include: new conditions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, 
clinically significant abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc), or clinically significant abnormal test results (i.e. lab values o r vital signs), with the exception of 
outcome measure results, which are not being recorded as adverse events in this trial (they are being collected, but analyzed separately). Stable chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that are present prior to  the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial are NOT considered 
adverse events. Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recor ded as adverse 
events.  
 Adverse events are generally detected in two ways:  
  Clinical  symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075]. 
 Ancillary Tests  abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures 
(other than the outcome measures: the results of which are not being captured as AEs).   If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_246412].  However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by [CONTACT_246413] a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those that are identified as such by [CONTACT_737].

Version date 01/March/[ADDRESS_299686] caused the event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following 
criteria:  
 
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurred. 
a. This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the Site Investigator or 
Sponsor, is at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs .  It does not apply if an 
AE hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
a. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] (including elective PEG tube/g- tube/feeding 
tube placement) or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by [CONTACT_246414] “procedure” or a “treatment” is not an untoward medical occurrence.  
4. Results in persist ent or significant disability or incapacity.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_243077] a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or female).   
6. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. 
7. Important medical events that may  not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243047], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the o utcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246383] e of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, clinical 
adverse event may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience, and will 
therefore, not be considered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission (subject admitted for other reasons than medical, e.g., lives far from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to sleep). 
 A serious, suspected adverse drug reaction is an SAE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_246384], suggests a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the event.  The Site Investigator is responsible for classifying adverse events as serious or non-serious.

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment and Recording of Adverse Events  
 
This study will utilize the CTCAE version 4.0 coding system for adverse event recording.  Adverse events reported using CTCAE will be recoded into the CRF.  
 
Assessment of Adverse Events  
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked “Have you had any problems or symptoms since your last visit?” in order to determine the occurrence of adverse events. If the subject reports an adverse event, the Investigator will determine: 
 
1. Type of event 
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration) 
3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE) 
5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease 
6. Action taken regarding investigational product 
7. Outcome 
 
Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Product 
The relationship of the AE to the investigational product should be specified by [CONTACT_67505], using the following definitions:  
1. Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with 
treatment.  
2. Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 
3. Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_246415]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_243079]. (suspected ADR) 
4. Probably Related: The reaction  follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration 
of investigational product; is confirmed by [CONTACT_246416]-challenge; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state. (suspected ADR)  
5. Definitely Related:  The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_141507], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. (suspected ADR)

Study Sites:   This study will be conducted at approximately 40 – 50 sites in approximately 10 countries 
worldwide
Study Population:   
Levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease patients with severe motor fluctuations and 
hyperkinesia/dyskinesia when available combinations of Parkinson medicinal products have not given satisfactory results.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 88 subjects (44 per each treatment group)
Methodology:   
Figure 1:  Study Design Schematic
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, randomized multicenter 26-week study comparing LCIG to optimized medical treatment (OMT).  The study will consist of 3 sequential periods:  Screening, Treatment and Follow-Up.  The OMT group will have the same schedule of visits/procedures throughout the study as the LCIG group except for visits related to NJ/PEG procedures and titration of LCIG.

Methodology (Continued):
The Screening Period (V1 – V3)
The Screening Period will be the same for all subjects screened into the study.  The Screening Period will 
consist of three visits, Visit 1 (V1), Visit 2 ([V2] [optional]) and the Randomization Visit (V3) in which the subject will be assessed to determine eligibility.  A movement disorder specialist should perform an interview of the subject at screening.  The duration of the Screening Period can be between 30 – 67 days to accommodate the required procedures, training and collection of diaries, and allow for stabilization of anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS.  All anti-PD medications and any other medications used to treat individual non-motor symptoms (e.g., Insomnia, depression, anxiety), must be stable with no adjustments to the frequency of administration, dose of administration or total daily dose.  Both anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS are required to be stable for a minimum of 30 days.  During the Screening Period, no study drug (LCIG) will be administered.  Visit [ADDRESS_1282498] need during stabilization of anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS.  Subjects who are deemed eligible by [CONTACT_912939] 3 will be randomized at the end of Visit 3 to receive LCIG or continue on OMT following baseline assessments.
Treatment Period (V4 – V8)
OMT Group:
Those subjects randomized to continue OMT will remain on their current optimized regimen and will 
have study visits at the end of Weeks 2, 6, 12, and 26 following randomization (V3).  The OMT group will not have a V4 (NJ/PEG-J Placement).  The day after randomization (V3) will be considered Day 1 of their treatment period.
During the treatment phase, changes to anti-PD and NMS medications should remain stable and can only 
be made if medically indicated.  Changes to the OMT arm can be made "if medically justified," not only for serious safety reasons.
LCIG Group:
In accordance with the LCIG approved Product Label for countries participating in the study, those 
subjects randomized to LCIG must discontinue all other anti-PD medications (e.g., dopamine agonists, COMT-inhibitors, amantadine, MAO-B inhibitors, anti-cholinergics, and subcutaneous apomorphine etc.) prior to LCIG initiation on Day 1 (V4); these medications should be tapered off according to the prescribing information and the discretion of the Investigator.  With the exception of continuous subcutaneous delivery of apomorphine or levodopa containing formulations, these medications may be restarted if indicated by [CONTACT_423]'s individual condition, but not within the first 28 days after LCIG initiation.
For those subjects randomized to LCIG, an optional, temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may be used 
initially to titrate the dose of LCIG.  Following the NJ phase, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal tube (PEG-J) will be performed by a gastroenterologist proceduralist.  Total time to titration via the NJ and PEG-J should not exceed [ADDRESS_1282499] proceeds directly to PEG-J, titration should be completed within 7 days.  However, at the PI's discretion additional days of optimization may be made if indicated.  Subjects on LCIG will return for study visits at the end of Weeks 2, 6, 12, [ADDRESS_1282500] 2014-004865-26

Methodology (Continued):
LCIG Group (Continued):
Subjects and/or caregivers must come into the clinic or pharmacy between V7 (Week 12) and V8 
(Week 26) for clinical LCIG return and supply visits so that there is no risk of medication expi[INVESTIGATOR_246359].  The 
drug dispensing visits will occur at Weeks 17 and 22 (± 7 days).  Other assessments may be completed during these visits if required.
During the treatment phase, medications used to treat specific non-motor symptoms must remain stable 
for the duration of the study unless medically warranted.
Study Follow-Up
The OMT subjects will not have a follow-up visit (V9).For LCIG subjects who elect to discontinue LCIG and not continue with commercially available product, 
a V9 will be conducted one week after NJ/PEG-J removal and the follow-up period will be up until 
30 days after NJ/PEG-J removal.  For LCIG subjects who will transition to commercial product, the SAE/AE follow-up period will be 30 days after conversion to commercial.

Efficacy:Efficacy Dataset and Treatment Period
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the intent-to-treat dataset which will include all subjects who 
are randomized to the optimized medical treatment, and all subjects who are randomized to LCIG and received at least one dose of study drug.  For assessments of efficacy the treatment period will begin the day after randomization (V3) for subjects randomized to OMT, and the day of first LCIG infusion following PEG-J placement for subjects randomized to LCIG treatment.  The treatment period will end on the day of the final visit for subjects randomized to OMT, and on the last day of LCIG study drug infusion for subjects randomized to LCIG treatment.  The last assessment prior to randomization will be considered baseline and the last assessment that is no more than [ADDRESS_1282514] 2014-004865-26

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Primary Efficacy Analysis
There are 2 alternative primary efficacy variables, change from baseline to Week 26 for NMSS total 
score and change from baseline to Week 26 for PDSS-2 total score.  Either variable considered statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment is sufficient to declare success of the study.
The primary efficacy analysis model is a likelihood-based mixed-effects model repeated measures 
(MMRM) analysis of the change from baseline for each post-baseline observation using all observed data.  The model will include fixed, categorical effects for treatment, site, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, with continuous fixed covariates for baseline score and the baseline score-by-visit interaction.  The primary comparison will be the contrast between LCIG and optimized oral treatment at the Week 26 Visit.
The two-sided Pvalues obtained from the MMRM model for NMSS total score change from baseline to 
Week 26 and PDSS-2 total score change from baseline to Week 26 will be adjusted for multiplicity using 
the Hochberg procedure.  This method controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) at a pre-specified significance level (alpha = 0.05).  Specifically, the following steps will be followed:
!If the larger of the 2 Pvalues is ≤ 0.05 (i.e., both Pvalues are ≤ 0.05), both endpoints are 
considered statistically significant.
!If the larger of the 2 Pvalues is > 0.05, then compare the smaller Pvalue with 0.025.  The 
second endpoint is statistically significant if the Pvalue is ≤ 0.025; otherwise, neither endpoint 
is considered statistically significant.
Secondary Efficacy Analyses
There are 3 key secondary endpoints:
!PDQ-8 summary index
!CGI-C
!UPDRS Part II score
The key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the primary 
efficacy variables.  For CGI-C, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.
If both primary efficacy variables are statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity, the Stepwise 
Gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_912905] 3 key secondary endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg procedure with significance level of 0.05.
Other secondary endpoints below will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the primary efficacy 
variables:
!NMSS domain scores
!PDSS-2 domain  scores
!UPDRS total score, Part I score, Part III score, Part IV score
!PGIC
!Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) total and subscale scores
!Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) score
For the analysis on PGIC, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.

Safety:
Safety Dataset and Treatment Period
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety dataset which will include all subjects who are 
randomized to the optimized medical treatment, and all subjects who are randomized to LCIG and received at least one dose of study drug.  The treatment period for safety is the same as what is defined for efficacy.
Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will include summaries of adverse events, device-related product complaints, vital signs 
and special labs.
Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 88 subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1282516] deviation of 24.  Results from Zibetti et al (2013) showed that the improvement in PDSS-[ADDRESS_1282517] deviation was not provided and is estimated to be 12.2 assuming the correlation between baseline and follow-up visits is 0.5.
The significance level for this study is 0.05.  For sample size determination, it is assumed that the 
improvement in the OMT group is 33% of the LCIG group, i.e., the improvement is 8.[ADDRESS_1282518] 90% power to declare statistical significance on at least one of these 2 alternative primary endpoints after multiplicity adjustment using Hochberg procedure.  It is further assumed that 10% of randomized subjects in either treatment group will not provide post-randomization efficacy assessment.  Additional simulations showed that 44 subjects per group will provide 90% power in the sensitivity analysis using baseline observation carried forward for subjects without post-randomization assessment.  Therefore the total planned enrollment is decided to be [ADDRESS_1282519]

3.0 Introduction
The combination of levodopa-carbidopa continues to be a mainstay in the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (PD).1-3  As PD progresses, PD patients treated with oral levodopa 
may develop persistent motor fluctuations characterized by [CONTACT_912947] ("On-Off" phenome non) or levodopa-induced dyskinesia.  Motor 
fluctuations occur in about 40% of patients af ter 4 to 6 years of treatment with levodopa 
and up to 90% of patients may experience motor fluctuations after [ADDRESS_1282534] been taken to cope with the increasingly unstable levodopa 
response.  Levodopa dose and frequency of administration are usually adjusted, although many patients find it challenging to take frequent oral doses of medication.  Oral formulations of levodopa are often prescribed in combination with long-acting dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO Inhibitors) and catechol O methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors as well as apomorphine injection on an as needed basis.  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_912907], patients with advanced PD experience inadequate control of their motor performance.  A number of more invasive a pproaches have been explored and utilized 
with varying degrees of success; they include the continuous intravenous (IV) administration of levodopa,
7-10and deep brain stimulation (DBS).[ADDRESS_1282535] 2014-004865-26
23
reported in approximately 13% – 40% of patients including intracerebral hemorrhage, 
intracranial infection and death.12,13  The procedure is also not available in all settings and 
not all PD patients are candidates for brain surgery.14  Continuous administration of IV 
levodopa is not clinically feasible due to technical limitations.  However, studies with constant-rate delivery (i nfusion) of levodopa to the blood ha ve clearly resulted in marked 
stabilization of motor performance in advanced PD patients.
9,10,15
In addition to motor symptoms and motor fluctuations, patients with advanced PD also suffer from a constellation of non-motor symptoms (NMS) that is often overlooked yet also causes significant disability and impairment to quality of life.  The pathophysiology 
of NMS is poorly underst ood, but dysfunction of both dopaminergic and 
nondopaminergic systems are implicated in their development.  Non-motor symptoms consist of autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, sialorrhea, sexual 
dysfunction, urinary retention, temperature dysregulation, and sweating), cognitive and 
affective disturbances, sleep disorders, and sensory complaints.
Martinez-Martin et al have recently demonstrated that non-motor symptoms have, as a 
whole, a greater impact on health related quality of life (HRQoL) than motor symptoms.
[ADDRESS_1282536] demonstrated that NMS progression contributes importantly to HRQoL decline in patients with Parkinson's disease.  Similarly, Hinnell et al demonstrated that depression, anxiety, and other non-mood, non-cognitive NMS had a greater impact on HRQoL (as measured by [CONTACT_328162]'s Disease Questionnaire [PDQ]-8) than motor symptoms.
17  In the PRIAMO study,18which assessed NMS in over 
1,000 PD subjects using a semi -structured interview questionnaire consisting of 12 NMS 
domains defined by [CONTACT_181127], 98.6% of subjects reported the presence of NMS.  The prevalence of NMS was evaluated by [CONTACT_912948] 3 groups:  "naïve" subjects who had not been treated with dopaminergic agents, "stable" subjects who were under dopaminergic treatment and had no motor complications, and "complicated" subjects who had developed motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia under dopaminergic treatment.  The most common  NMS and their prevalence in PD subjects 
were as follows:  fatigue (58%), anxiety (56%), leg pain (38%), insomnia (37%), urgency

24
and nocturia (35%), drooling of saliva, and difficulties in maintaining concentration 
(31%).  The NMS domains of gastrointestinal, pain, urinary, sleep, and skin disorders and "miscellaneous" were more frequent in the "stable" and "complicated" subjects than in the "naïve" subjects.  However, the frequency of cardiovascular symptoms, fatigue, apathy, attention/memory, psychiatric, and respir atory symptoms did not differ across the 
3 groups.  The prevalence of sleep disorders increased with disease severity.  Sleep disorders were reported by 47.9% and 81.6% of subjects with mild (Hoehn and Yahr stage = 1) and severe (Hoehn and Yahr stage = 4 – 5) disease respectively.  The mean 
number of NMS per subject was 7.8 during the prior month and the frequency of NMS increased with disease duration and severity of disease.  Using a structured questionnaire of 54 questions on various NMS, Witjas et al found that 64% of PD patients had experienced drenching sweats, 44% flushing, 44% oral dryness, and 40% constipation.
19   
These symptoms were associated with a high disability rating and poorer quality of life.  Other prevalent NMS include sleep disturbances (insomnia, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], restless legs and intense vivid dreams), impaired me mory and concentration, depression, and 
dribbling.
20  PD patients suffer from a variety of s leep disturbances including excessive 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fragmented sleep, REM (rapid eye movement) behavioral sleep disorder (RBD), periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep apnea and insomnia.  Ondo et al evaluated the prevalence of nocturnal sleep disorders in over 300 PD subjects with an average disease duration of 9 years and a mean Hoehn and Yahr score of 2.5 using a survey combining questions from various sleep scales.
21  The study demonstrated that 43% of subjects experienced RBD, 51% 
somniloquism (talking in their sleep), 39% snoring (indicative of sleep apnea), 20% RLS, and an average of almost 3 awakenings pe r night.  Additionally, the PRIAMO study found 
that 64% of PD subjects suffered from sleep disorders overall with 75% in Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5 – 3 and 82% in Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 – 5.

Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) has been marketed for 10 years.  The LCIG 
System is currently approved in 42 countries for the treatment of levodopa-responsive 
advanced PD.  In the majority of countries, it is marketed under the trade name [CONTACT_913010].  
LCIG is a suspension of levodopa-carbi dopa monohydrate (4:1) in an aqueous gel 
(carboxymethyl cellulose) with a viscosity that permits homogeneous distribution of micronized substance particles.  Upon upper intestinal administration, the compounds are dissolved in situ and levodopa is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_912908].  LCIG provides continuous rather than intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic receptors in the brain by [CONTACT_912949]'s therapeutic window.  When delivered via continuous intestinal infusion therapy, LCIG  reduces "Off" time and increases "On" 
time compared to oral levodopa-carbidopa.
[ADDRESS_1282539] that the improvement 
of LCIG infusion may be correlated with the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms while on oral treatment.
23  The delivery of LCIG directly to the upper intestine is anticipated to 
result in the following:2,15
●Continuous delivery of levodopa -carbidopa
●Avoidance of the effects of pulsatile gastric emptying
●Reduced variability in plasma-levodopa concentrations
●Decreased motor fluctuations and dyskinesia

LCIG is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy with jejunal extension tube (PEG -J).  The LCIG is dispensed in medication 
cassette reservoirs.  The contents of the medication cassette reservoir are delivered via continuous administration by [CONTACT_912950] 1 .  Efficacy of 
upper-intestinal administration of LCIG has been  demonstrated in Phase 3 studies.  In the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study (Study S187.3.001/Study S187.3.002), compared to Levodopa-Carbidopa I mmediate Release (LC-IR), LCIG significantly improved "Off" 
time (LS Mean difference = –1.91 hours, P= 0.0015) and "On" time without troublesome 
dyskinesia ("On" time without dyskinesia + "On" time with non-troublesome dyskinesia, LS Mean difference = 1.86 hours, P= 0.0059) at Week 12.  At Week 12, compared with 
LC-IR, LCIG significantly decreased the per centage of the waking day in the "Off" state 
and significantly increased the percentage of waking day in the "On" state without troublesome dyskinesia.  LCIG also produced a significantly greater change from baseline in "On" time without dyskinesia compared to LC-IR.  Most adverse events were transient and were mild or moderate in intensity and were generally associated with the PEG-J procedure and its complications.  The most common adverse events were complication of device insertion (56.8%), abdominal pain (51.4%), nausea (29.7%), procedural pain (29.7%), constipation (21.6%) and incision site erythema (18.9%).
16
Improvements were also seen with LCIG in  disease-specific and global Quality of Life 
(QoL) measures, as assessed by [CONTACT_912951]-Improvement scale (CGI-I), 
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 Item (PDQ-39) total scores, and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) scores.
24
In a long-term open-label safety study (Study S187-3-004) conducted over 54 weeks with 324 subjects, a clinically meaningful reduction in "Off" time was apparent by [CONTACT_10585] 4 and persisted to the Week 54 endpoint.  All of the reduction in "Off" time (4.44 hours, P< 0.001) was accompanied by [CONTACT_156715] "On" time without troublesome dyskinesia 
(4.80 hours, P< 0.001), as was observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  This improvement was 
achieved with the majority of subjects (> 75%) requiring onl y levodopa-carbi dopa therapy 
for treating their PD symptoms throughout the study.  The most common adverse events 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282541] 2014-004865-26
27
(≥10% of subjects) were complication of device insertion (34.9%), abdominal pain 
(31.2%), procedural pain (20.7%), nausea (16.7%), excessive granulation tissue (16.0%), 
postoperative wound infection (15.4%), fall (15.1%), constipation (14.5%), insomnia, (13.6%), incision site erythema (13.0%), and urinary tract infection (11.4%).  For each of these preferred terms, the adverse events for the majority of subjects were mild to moderate as assessed by [CONTACT_093].
Just as LCIG is effective in treating motor fluctuation in advanced PD, it has the potential 
to treat many of the NMS associated with PD as well.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], treatment of any of these NMS require additive therapy and exposes th e patient to drug-drug interactions as well as 
the potential side effect from these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Non-motor symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease and even predate motor symptoms, but remain present in all stages of the disease and become more prominent as the disease progresses.
[ADDRESS_1282542] they been well recognized as important features of the disease.
26  There are 2 primary reasons why NMS has not been recognized as 
important features of disease:  1) Lack of disease specific instruments to assess NMS and 2) Treatments for PD typi[INVESTIGATOR_912909]; consequently, NMS 
tend to be underreported and inade quately treated in the clinical setting.
27,28  One study in 
the US demonstrated that existing depression, anxiety and fatigue are not identified by [CONTACT_912952] 50% of consultations, and existing sleep disturbances in over 40%.

scale (PDSS) and PDQ-8.  A statist ically si gnificant beneficial effect was shown in the 
NMSS total score (56% improvement from baseline) and 6 of the 9 domains of the 
NMSS:  cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, attention/memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and miscellaneous (including pain and dribbling).  These results paralleled the improvement observed in motor symptoms.  In addition, significant improvements were found on the PDSS (33% improvement from baseline) and in health-related quality of life (assessed by [CONTACT_75117]-8).  The improvement in PDQ-[ADDRESS_1282546] of LCIG on NMS in 17 advanced PD subjects treated 
with LCIG versus 9 matched PD controls not treated with LCIG over 6 months.
31  There 
were no significant changes in NMS as measured by [CONTACT_103605]-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) in the control group while the LCIG treated subjects demonstrated a significant improvement in NMSS total score ( P= 0.004) and the subdomains of sleep, 
gastrointestinal, urinary, and sexual function.  The differences in change from baseline to follow-up between the Duodopa treated group and the control gr oup was statist ically 
significant for NMSS total score ( P= < 0.027) and for the subdomains of cardiovascular, 
sleep, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous.
Pusuiainen et al examined the effects  of LCIG on NMS in 9 PD subjects over 
two months.
32  Statistically significant improvement was seen in the NMSS total score 
(52% decrease, P= 0.008) and the subdomains of sleep/fatigue, gastrointestinal, and 
miscellaneous.A retrospective study that evaluated change from baseline in NMS using the NMSS 
instrument in 14 subjects with advanced PD treated with LCIG for an average of 25 months also demonstrated 14% improvement in the NMSS total score but the results did not reach statistical significance.
30  Although some of the individual domains showed 
improvement with LCIG, none reached statisti cal significance.  Psychiatric symptoms 
were significantly improved as revealed by a significant reduction in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I, Neurops ychiatric Inventory, a nd Questionnaire for 
Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease.  Additionally, an improvement 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282547] of LCIG on sleep in Parkinson's disease patients, 
no previous studies have compared LCIG to optimized medical therapy using the PDSS-2 as an endpoint.  Results from a prospective baseline control study conducted by [CONTACT_912953]-2 total score was 13.1 (34% improvement) after an average of 3.[ADDRESS_1282548] now been shown to improve depression, REM behavioral sleep disorder, nocturia, and erectile dysfunction.
34  Dopaminergic agents can also improve 
"Off"-related NMS, such as pain, anxiety,  flushing, and depression.  Although it is 
becoming more recognized that dopaminergic agents can treat certain NMS, their supposed effectiveness was limited by [CONTACT_912954], and quantify their impact on a patient's overall wellbeing.  Motor and non-motor symptoms  closely correlate 
with fluctuating plasma concentrations of levodopa and the corresponding pulsat ile 
concentration of dopamine in the striatum.
35-37  Plasma levels of orally administered 
levodopa fluctuate significantly due to its short half-life and the variability in gastric emptying.
38,39  Treatments that offer continuous levodopa administration result in less 
variability in levodopa plasma concentration and are believed to provide more continuous dopaminergic stimulation, and, therefore, reduce the frequency and severity of motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and non-motor symptoms.
40,41  Therefore, reducing the amount of 
"Off" time should improve those fluctuating NMS.  Additionally, since LCIG is initiated 
and often maintained as monotherapy, tapering off of other anti-PD medications may also lead to improvement in certain non-motor sy mptoms.  Continuous delivery of levodopa, 
which has the potential to offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation has potential to lead 
to neuroplastic changes that may also improve those non-fluctuating NMS. 
An understanding of LCIG effects on NMS can provide important information for 
physicians, patients and caregivers when assessing the benefits of advanced treatment.

3.1 Differences Statement
In previous Phase 3 LCIG studies as part of the US registration package which studied 
adult subjects with advanced levodopa-respons ive PD with persistent motor-fluctuations 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_912911], the primary efficacy endpoint was change in motor fluctuations (specifically "Off" time).  Study M12-920, an ongoing Phase 3b open-label single arm, baseline-cont rolled study, with an out-patient PEG-J 
procedure, evaluated the effect of LCIG on non-motor symptoms in advanced PD in 36 subjects using the NMSS; however effect of LCIG on sleep using the PDSS-[ADDRESS_1282550] of LCIG on NMS compared to optimized medical therapy asassessed by [CONTACT_912955]-2.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Benefits
LCIG provides continuous rather than intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic 
receptors in the brain by [CONTACT_912956].  The gel formulation, typi[INVESTIGATOR_912912] a monotherapy regimen, allows a greater flexibility in individualized dosing, thereby [CONTACT_912957].
Efficacy of LCIG on motor symptoms in subjects with advanced PD has been 
demonstrated in Phase 3 studies.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study (3.001/3.002), compared to LC-IR, LCIG significantly improved "Off" time (LS Mean difference = –1.91 hours) and 
"On" time without troublesome dyskinesia (LS Mean difference = 1.86 hours) at Week 12.  LCIG also demonstrated a sta tistically and clinically significant impact on 
subject's quality of life as assessed with the PDQ-39 summary index and the UPDRS Part II score.  Subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease who qualify for the study are expected to benefit through better control of the motor fluctuations that are not adequately controlled with PD medications.
[ADDRESS_1282551] 2014-004865-26
31
demonstrated improvement in NMSS total score, NMSS subdomains and PDSS-2 with 
LCIG either versus optimized medical therapy or in open-label, single-group studies.  
Risks
Due to the long experience with the oral drug combination of levodopa and carbidopa for 
the treatment of PD, the risks that are associated with both active pharmaceut ical 
ingredients are well known.  These and additional information on risks are available in the Investigator's Brochure.
[ADDRESS_1282552] (AESI) related to LCIG, a therapeutic system consisting of the drug, the devices, and the placement procedure for  the NJ or PEG-J tubing,  have been identified and form the basis of the European Union Risk Management Plan.
43  
AESIs for this study are defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and comprise the following:
Known Risks
●Gastrointestinal and Gastrointestinal Procedure Related Events
Potential Risks
●Polyneuropathy
●Weight Loss
In the previous Phase 3 clinical program, as observed in an integrated summary of safety, AEs were common and occurred in 93.9% of the 412 subjects in the Open-Label LCIG Analysis Set (Phase 3 Studies S187.3.003, S187.3.004, and S187.3.005).  The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were complication of device insertion (33.3%), abdominal pain (28.2%), postoperative wound infection (23.5%), insomnia (23.3%), fall (23.1%), procedural pain (20.9%), excessive granulation tissue (20.6%), nausea (20.4%), constipation (20.4%), a nd incision site erythema (20.1%) 
(Table 1 ).  These AEs are commonly associated with underlying PD or are frequently 
observed following PEG-J placement.  Treatmen t emergent adverse events reported in

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter  26-week study comparing LCIG to OMT on 
NMS associated with advanced PD.  This study will be conducted at approximately 40 –

Figure 2. Study Design Schematic
The study is designed to enroll an adequate number of subjects such that approximately 
88 subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1282557] of 3 sequential periods:  Screening, Treatment and Follow-Up.
5.1.[ADDRESS_1282558] of three visits, Visit 1 (V1), Visit 2 ([V2] [optional]) and the Randomization Visit (V3) in which the subject will be assessed to determine eligibility.  A movement disorder specialist should perform a sc reening interview of the subject.  The 
duration of the Screening Period can be between 30 – [ADDRESS_1282559] udy drug will be administered.
Visit 1 (V1)
Following informed consent, at V1, study eligibility will be assessed through a series of tests and scales.  V1 assessmen ts may be performed over a period of multiple days.  Refer 
to Table 3 of Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a detailed list of assessments and procedures.  
●Laboratory results should be available before V3 (or optional V2) to review for 
continued subject eligibility. 
●The UPDRS, Part III, will be completed during the subject's "Off" and best 
"On" times.  The practically defined "Off" time UPDRS will be done in the 
morning prior to the subject taking their  first daily dose of anti-PD medication.  
At a minimum a subject should be [ADDRESS_1282560] "On" time rating will usually be done [ADDRESS_1282561] any morning dose of study drug or anti-PD medications but prior 
to lunch.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of day throughout the trial.  The "Off" time UPDRS will only be done during 
Screening; all other UPDRS assessments will be done during "On" time.
●The PI [INVESTIGATOR_912913]/or PEG-J and a decision made at this time if they will do the optional NJ period or go 
directly to PEG-J should they be randomized to the LCIG treatment group.  This is to allow for scheduling of the NJ and/or PEG-J at this time.
●The time period between V1 and optional V2 should not exceed 60 days.
●Additionally, a GI exam to determin e suitability for PEG-J placement and a 
dermatologic evaluation for the presence of melanoma must be performed 
prior to V3 (or optional V2).
●All anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS must be stable for at 
least [ADDRESS_1282562] 2014-004865-26
37
Optional Visit 2 (V2)
Visit 2 will occur between 30 to 60 days after V1.  Visit 2 is optional and is based on the 
Investigator's discretion of individual subject need during stabilization of anti-PD 
medications and medications to treat NMS.  Subjects must be on stable anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS for at least [ADDRESS_1282563] remain stable between V2 
and V3.
Visit 3 (V3)
Visit 3 will be the randomization visit.  The timeframe from V2 to the V3 will be
3 – 7 days. 
Only those subjects who meet the following randomization criterion will be randomized at 
the end of V3 to one of the treatment groups:
●Subject must have a minimum PDSS-2 total score of 18 at Baseline 
assessment .
In addition at V3 the following should occur:
●Concomitant Medication (including anti- PD medications); Subjects' anti-PD 
medications must be stable during the 3 – 7 days between V2 and V3.
●Anti-PD Medication History:  NMS Medication History:  medications used to 
treat individual non-motor symptoms (e.g., Insomnia, depression, anxiety).  Subjects' medications to treat NMS must be stable during the 3 – 7 days 
between V2 and V3.
●Training on the LCIG System and Pu mp will be initiated only for subjects 
randomized for LCIG and their caregivers, as applicable.

●UPDRS, Parts I – V will be completed during the subject's "On" time.
5.1.2 The Treatment Period
[IP_ADDRESS] OMT Group
Those subjects randomized to OMT at the end of V3 will continue on their current 
anti-PD medication regimen for the duration of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_912914].  PIs should make any effort to keep all anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS stable for the duration of the study.  Changes to the OMT arm can be made "if medically justified" or if absolutely indicated for safety reasons.  The day after V3 will be consider ed Day [ADDRESS_1282565] at the end of Weeks 2 through 26 respectively.  Data from all visits will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the assessments completed as in Table 3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] LCIG Treatment Group
Tapering of Anti-PD Medications Other Than Levodopa
All subjects randomized to the LCIG group should have all anti-PD medications, with the 
exception of levodopa formulations, tapered off within [ADDRESS_1282566] be discontinued prior to LCIG initiation.  A ll anti-PD medicat ions, other than subcutaneous continuous 
delivery of apomorphine and levodopa formul ations as outlined in the allowable 
medications section can be restarted 28 days after LCIG initiation if medically necessary for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms.
NJ and/or PEG-J Placement
LCIG is intended for continuous intestinal ad ministration.  A temporary NJ tube may be 
used initially with the infusion pump to deter mine if the subject responds favorably to this

method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal (PEG-J) tube is started.  Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of the permanent PEG-J tube and perform titration without the NJ phase if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. 
Visit 4 (V4), Day 1 Optional Nasojejunal (NJ) Phase and/or PEG-J Placement
Subjects will have the NJ and/or PEG-J tube placement procedure performed on Study Day [ADDRESS_1282568] (or delegated experienced nurse for NJ).  V4 assessments must be performed on the same day that the NJ and/or PEG-J tube is placed with the followi ng exception:  if NJ is used and placed via 
the passive method, the radiological check will be completed when the tube is expected to be located in the correct position (which may take around [ADDRESS_1282569] ice 
procedures should be followed).  The NJ and/or PEG-J tube will be placed such that the end of the tubing is just beyond the ligament of Treitz.  Once there is confirmation of tube placement all necessary procedures will be followed to attach the pump, with the LCIG cassette, to the NJ and/or PEG-J tube to initiate treatment with LCIG.  The gastroenterologist proceduralist or surgeon will check the subject's stoma site within 24 hours of the PEG-J placement. 
The optional NJ Period will end with the decis ion to either continue with treatment and 
the placement of a permanent jejunal extension tube by [CONTACT_31410]-J placement procedure or to 
discontinue further treatment.  
Certain procedures will be repeated prior to PEG-J placement for those who underwent 
the NJ period as outlined in the table of  activities ( Table 3 ).  The NJ tube will be removed 
at the time of the PEG-J procedure, or upon discontinuation of treatment with LCIG.  If the subject does not enter the PEG-J placement procedure phase of the study, all End-of-Study Treatment assessments, define d for Visit 9, Week 27, should be completed.

LCIG Initiation and Titration
Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement on Study Day [ADDRESS_1282571].  Optimal clinical response, or optimization, is defined as maximizing the functional "On" time during the day and minimizing the number of "Off" epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (bradykinesia) and the time the subject is "Off."  In addition, optimization minimizes "On" time wi th troublesome dyskinesia.  This 
determination is made by [CONTACT_737].  The dosage procedures for LCIG are described in Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_1282572] is discharged. 
Oral levodopa medication may only be used as a supplement during the night following 
discontinuation of the LCIG infusion.  During the day it should be used ONLY as rescue 
medication in case of acute deterioration, presumably caused by [CONTACT_912960]/or 
the pump or the onset of an acute illness.
It may take several days to optimize LCIG treatment.  In some subjects, optimization may 
take longer and subjects may remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912915].  For those subjects with an NJ placement they may or may not continue the NJ Period at home until the PEG-J is inserted.
During the initial titration phase, extra doses may be administered by [CONTACT_912961].  Pump programming should onl y be done by [CONTACT_912962].  After the nightly 
discontinuation of LCIG drug administration, levodopa-DDI (DOPA decarboxylase

inhibitor) tablets may be taken up to 2 hours (for oral LC-IR) or 4 hours (for oral LC-CR) 
prior to the administration of the next morning dose of LCIG and should not be counted as rescue.  While the subject is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the study staff may use the Dose Titration 
Diary as a tool to achieve dose optimization.  In the event it is used it should be completed 
hourly until the dose is optimized and then once AM and once PM it will be completed until the subject is discharged.  All adjustments can be recorded on the Dose Titration Diary allowing the Investigator to appropriately  adjust, if needed, the following day's 
morning dose, continuous infusion rate and extra dose until the subject is optimized.  It is up to the discretion of the Investigator to determine how many titration days are necessary to obtain optimal clinical response.  Once optimized, dose adjustments to LCIG can be made up to Day 28.  After Day [ADDRESS_1282574] (and if a pplicable, their care-partner) will receive 
refresher training on stoma care, tube care and the use of the pump, as well as all the 
necessary procedures for device maintenance and documentation of LCIG cassette use.
Titration can be done as an inpatient or outpatient.  In the event the subject is no longer 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912916].  These visits will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the assessments completed as in Table [ADDRESS_1282575]'s stoma site anyt ime 
from Day 2 to 7 after the PEG-J procedure.

Visit [ADDRESS_1282576] NJ and/or PEG-J insertion.  If subjects 
are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912917] 14 days of the NJ and/or PEG-J Placement Procedure Period this visit will take place when the subject is st ill in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If sub jects have been 
discharged prior to V5, it will be conducted as a site visit.  Study activities at V5 (Week 2) must be completed even if the subject titration is still occurring.  Visits 6, [ADDRESS_1282577] 2014-004865-26

end of Weeks 6, 12 and 26 respectively will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the 
assessments completed as in Table 3 .
Allowed anti-PD medications (as indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) may be restarted or 
initiated if indicated by [CONTACT_912963] e subject, but not within 28 days after PEG 
placement procedure.  
Drug Dispensing Visits
Subjects and/or caregivers must come into the clinic or pharmacy between V7 (Week 12) 
and V8 (Week 26) for clinical LCIG return and supply visits so that there is no risk ofmedication expi[INVESTIGATOR_246359].  The drug dispensing visits will occur at Weeks 17 and 22 (± 7 days).  Other assessments may be completed during these visits if required.
5.1.3 Study Follow-Up
Follow-Up Visit (V9) (LCIG Subjects not Continuing on Commercial Product)
For subjects who are not continuing on LCIG (through commercial sources in countries 
where LCIG is approved and marketed), the PEG-J tube will be removed following the End of Study activities.  A follow-up clinic visit will occur approximately one week later.
Commercial Transition Visits (LCIG Subjects Continuing on Commercial Product)
Study subjects in the LCIG group who complete participation in the study and for whom 
continuation of treatment with LCIG is judged appropriate by [CONTACT_912964]'s commercial affiliate.
Additional visits every [ADDRESS_1282578] transfer to commercial LCIG.  Refer to 
Table 3 of Section [IP_ADDRESS] for list of assessments.  Drug resupply visits will also occur at 
[ADDRESS_1282579]'s personal physician.  All necessary support will be provided 
by [CONTACT_1034]'s local representative.  Follow-up care in these circumstances will be based on the judgment of the subject's personal physician and no formal collection of data will be conducted except for regular ADR-reporting in accordance with local instructions.

Allowable Medications
Anti-Parkinsonian Medications
The following classes of anti-Parkinsonian medications will be allowed during the study:
1. Levodopa formulations
●For the OMT group, all levodopa formulations are allowed
●For the LCIG group:
○levodopa formulations can only be used at nighttime (the 8 hours when the 
pump is not in use) or as rescue medication

●long-acting levodopa formulations can only be used at nighttime (at 
least 4 hours prior the next day's morning dose)
●short-acting levodopa formulations with the exception of formulations containing entacapone can only be used at nighttime (at least 2 hours 
prior to the next day's morning dose) or as rescue medication
2. Dopamine agonists (not including apomorphine continuous infusion or PRN 
injection)
3. MAO-B inhibitors
4. Anti-cholinergics5. Amantadine
General Requirements
Screening to Visit 3:   All anti-Parkinson's disease medications must be stable* for at least 
30 days prior to V3 baseline assessments (NMSS and PDSS-2).
* A stable regimen is defined as no changes to the frequency of administration, dose of 
administration or total daily dose.
Randomization to End of Treatment Period:
●OMT Group:   all anti-PD medications should remain stable from 
randomization to the Week 26 visit and study assessments. Changes to the 
OMT arm can be made "if medically justified."
●LCIG Group:   all anti-PD medications except levodopa formulations must be 
tapered off after randomization and prior to LCIG initiation via NJ or PEG-J 
(in those going directly to PEG-J). Time of inverse titration should be done following the prescribing information and the Investigator's discretion, but 
should not exceed [ADDRESS_1282596] during the study (from signing the Informed Consent

eCRF, except for study drug for subjects randomized to LCIG.  All changes to concomitant medications, this includes all medications taken by [CONTACT_912968], must be carefully documented on the Concomitant Medication eCRF form.
Medications to Treat Non-Motor Symptoms (OMT and LCIG Groups)
Medications used for the treatment of non-motor symptoms (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, 
sleep disorders, fatigue, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, attention, sialorrhea, dysphagia, constipation, sexual dysfunction, pain, appetite, sweating) are allowed during the study except those for cognition or that have pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics interactions with levodopa as listed in Table [ADDRESS_1282597] 30 days between V1 and V2 and through the Randomization assessments (N MSS and PDSS-2) at the Randomization visit (V3).  
These medications must then also remain stable for the duration of the study.  However, if absolutely necessary for a significant me dical need related to patient safety, the 
Investigator can make modifications to these medications or add additional medications after discussion with the medical monitor.  This will be considered a protocol deviation but the subject will not be discontinued from  the study.  Caffeine is allowed during the 
screening period and the duration of the study, but the same pattern of consumption should be maintained to avoid potential confounds of caffeine.
Required Concomitant Medication, Antibiotics
The use of prophylactic antibiotics is required prior to PEG-J procedure.  At minimum, a 
single dose of a 1stor 3rdgeneration cephalosporin (or an antibiotic with similar coverage) 
must be administered approximately [ADDRESS_1282598] 2014-004865-26

typi[INVESTIGATOR_655276]-time regimen of oral LC-IR or levodopa-carbidopa continuous-release (LC-CR) following the daily discontinuation of the 16-hour infusion, only if they were 
taking this during the [ADDRESS_1282601] remain unchanged.  (The Investigator will provide a prescription for the doses of oral LC-IR or LC-CR that the subject takes on a regular nightly basis.)  After the nightly discontinuation of LCIG drug administration, levodopa-DDI tablets may be taken up to two hours (for oral LC-IR) or 4 hours (for oral LC-CR) prior to the administration of the next morning dose of LCIG and should not be counted as rescue.  The subject should record all oral levodopa-carbidopa tablets on the Subject Dosing Diary on the assigned days.
Those subjects randomized to the OMT group will remain on their normal, stable 
nighttime regimen if applicable.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Table [ADDRESS_1282616] comp laints (S ection 6.0).
Due to the length of assessments on Visit 1, a ssessments may be perf ormed over [ADDRESS_1282617] (and if 
appropriate, their caregiver) prior to performing any study-related procedures.  Consenting will be performed according to local regulations.
Subject Medical and Neurological History
A complete medical history, including alcohol, drug, tobacco and nicotine-containing 
product use histories will be taken at the time indicated in Table 3 .  Additionally, chronic 
disorders (e.g., diabetes and hay fever) that began prior to Screening and are still present at Screening should be recorded on the Me dical History Form.  The Medical History 
obtained at V1 will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  All psychiatric, neurological, behavioral and/or cognitive dia gnosis should be reported.  Updates should 
be made to the Medical/Neurological/PD History with any findings from Labs, Dermatologists, etc.
Subject Parkinson's Disease and NMS Treatment History
In order to qualify for enrollment in the study, the subject should provide the Investigator 
with a comprehensive history of their past anti-PD and NMS drug treatments.  This should be done according to the patient and/or caregiver recollection as well as available history in a subject's chart.  
NMS Medication History is to be collected at V1.  These include but are not limited to 
medications used for the treatment of the 9 NMS domains of:  experience of cardiovascular/falls, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations,

attention/memory, GI tract, urinary, sexual func tion, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, 
weight change excessive sweating). 
A careful review of the subject's PD history, previous and current PD treatments should
be performed by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., dosages, frequency of administration, duration of treatment, assessment and evaluation of the subject's response to those previous PD treatments) to determine if the subject is eligible for study participation.  
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
The MMSE44is a brief, 30-point questionnaire, administered by a trained rater, which 
provides a quantitative measure of cognitive mental status in adults and is widely used to 
screen for cognitive impairment and to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a 
given point in time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in a patient over time, and 
to document response to treatment.  In this study, MMSE will be used to screen for cognitive impairment.  The subject must have a score ≥ [ADDRESS_1282619] will be asked the 
following Sleep Attack Assessment questions:
Since your last visit or last time this question was asked, have you experienced any events 
in which you fell asleep suddenly or unexpectedly, including while engaged in some 
activity (e .g., eating/drinking, speak ing, or driving) or at rest, without any previous 
warning of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (e.g., feeling tired)?
●If yes, what specif ically happened?
●How many times did you experience such events?
●What were you doing at the time of each event?
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282620] 2014-004865-26
64
●Prior to each event did you experience any sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_8323]?  If yes, 
please explain/clarify.
●How long did each event last?
●Did you suffer any "bad" outcome/problem from each falling asleep event?
During the Screening Period, subjects should be asked to answer these questions based on 
their experiences during the three months prior to Screening Visit 1.  During the Screening Period, if the subject is currently or has been recently experiencing sleep attacks, they will be excluded from participation in the study and referred for appropriate follow-up care if the Investigator feels these are clinically significant.  The assessment of Sleep Attacks completed at the Screening Visit 1 will serve as baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
At Screening V1, V2 and Random ization V3 a full physical examination will be 
performed.  Symptom-driven physical examinations will be performed at subsequent 
visits.
Neurological Examination
A Neurological Examination focusing on sympto ms and signs of polyneuropathy (light 
touch and pi[INVESTIGATOR_333686], vibratory sensation), deep tendon reflexes, and strength 
assessments will be performed at the times indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282621]'s "On" time.
Any abnormalities or symptoms identified at Vi sits 1, [ADDRESS_1282622] dose of IP for the LCIG group will be recorded as adverse events.
The Neurological Examination will assess:

●Cranial nerves – assessment of cranial nerves II – XII
●Motor system – assessment of tone, strength and abnormal movements
●Sensory system – including light touch, pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107], joint position and vibratory 
sense
●Reflexes – assessment of deep tendon reflexes and plantar responses (Babinski sign)
●Coordination – assessment of upper and lower extremities
●Gait – assessment of base and tandem gait
The Neurological Examination performed at Vi sit 1, will serve as baseline for clinical 
assessment.
Dermatological Assessment
A comprehensive assessment by [CONTACT_912971][INVESTIGATOR_912926] V2 and at Week 26/Premature Discontinuati on.  If a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_772399], a 
biopsy should be obtained for proper diagnosis a nd confirmation that lesion does not meet 
exclusion criteria.
Positive screens will be exclusionary.
GI Examination
On or prior to V2, the Investigator and GI/surgeon will thoroughly evaluate the subject's 
risk of undergoing PEG-J procedure.
NJ and/or PEG-J Placement (LCIG Group Only)
For subjects randomized to LCIG, a temporary NJ tube may be used to optimize the dose 
of LCIG before treatment with a PEG-J is started.  The NJ test phase should not last longer than [ADDRESS_1282624].
Radiological Check of Tube Placement (LCIG Group Only)
Radiological check of NJ and PEG-J to determine correct location should occur prior to 
LCIG infusion initiation and prior to restar t of LCIG post PEG-J placement.  It can also 
be done at any time during treatment if indicated for worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms or non-responsiveness to extra doses. 
PEG-Site (Stoma) Check (LCIG Group Only)
Following the PEG-J placement, site personnel will review proper after-care instructions 
and checking of the stoma instructions with the subject and/or care-partner as provided in 
the patient care materials /booklets.
After the initial PEG-J procedure, the PEG-J and stoma must be inspected by a gastroenterologist proceduralist/surgeon/qualified radiologist (preferably the physician who placed the PEG-J), or their designated qualified personnel 2 – [ADDRESS_1282625] PEG-J procedure. 
Vital Signs/Weight
Body temperature, orthostatic vital signs and weight will be performed at the times 
indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282626] is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (after 3 to 5 minutes) and standing (after 2 minutes).  Study staff should make efforts to measure with the same arm and method including recording of arm and method in the subject's source documentation.
On the day of the first LCIG infusion, orthostatic vital signs should be obtained at 0, 1, [ADDRESS_1282627] will wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.
Height
Height will be measured only at V1; the subject will not wear shoes.12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A single 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at study visits indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282628] should be instructed to remain completely stationary during the recording, without talking, laughing, deep breathing or swallowing during the time of recording (10 seconds).
ECG Data Review 
Site personnel will transmit ECG data to an ECG central laboratory for central processing and reading by a qualified cardiologist (central reader) who will independently review each ECG.  The central reader will evaluate a single ECG lead (Lead II, with V5 or V2 [in that order] evaluated if Lead II cannot be evaluated).  Heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration and QT interval will be measured for each ECG with 3 to 5 beats.  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) will be determined using Fridericia's correction method (QTcF).
The central reader will also provide the interpretation of the ECG (i.e., "Normal" or 
"Abnormal").  The central ECG laboratory will send the ECG report to the site within 3 business days.  The Investigator (or physician designee) will review the central reader'sreport/assessment and document his/her review by [CONTACT_340263].  Only the central ECG laboratory's data will be collected into the 
database.  The Investigator should review and reconcile if necessary his/her interpretation of the ECG (normal/abnormal) with the central ECG laboratory in case of relevant divergent assessments and reconcile as he/she determines is appropriate.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282629] 2014-004865-26
68
The original ECG tracing and the central reader's interpretation, each with the 
Investigator's signature [CONTACT_3670], will be retained in the subject's records at the study site as source documents.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
A certified laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  All clinical laboratory  samples will be collected as indicated in Table 3
(see Table [ADDRESS_1282630] of laboratory evaluations).  The laboratory test results obtained at 
Visit [ADDRESS_1282631] review the laboratory assessments (initialed and dated) after the receipt of results.
All laboratory abnormalities that occur during the study must be evaluated by [CONTACT_912972] a new disease process, an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition, or require further action to be taken and therefore may 
need to be reported as adverse events.  Accordingly, for any values outside of the reference range, the Investigator will indicate on the report if the result is Clinically Significant (CS) or Not Clinically Significant (NCS).  If a laboratory abnormality meets criteria for a Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) laboratory value, as defined in 
Appendix D , the investigator must either report an associated adverse event or document 
in source the reason(s) the finding was not considered an adverse event.
The PT/PTT will be performed at Screening Visits 1 and 3. In the event the PT/PTT 
result at V3 is abnormal the subject shoul d not proceed with the NJ and/or PEG-J 
placement and should contact [CONTACT_7195].
Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at Premature Discontinuation/End of St udy 
and was judged to be clinically significant will be followed according to accepted medical 
standards until resolution of the abnormality.

study a subject displays symptoms of polyneuropathy, the Investigator must perform this lab panel and any other assessment that the Investigator feels is appropriate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms.
Urine Screens for Drugs of Abuse and Alcohol
A urine screen for drugs of abuse and medical marijuana and alcohol will be performed at 
V1 (Table 4 ).
The panel for drugs to be tested will minimally include the tests listed Table 4 .  The urine 
drug screen analysis at Visit 1 will be performed by [CONTACT_110995], and will be used for screening purposes.
The alcohol lab values will be recorded, as required by [CONTACT_912973] (e.g., polyneuropathy, etc.).
Special Laboratory Tests
Special labs to detect vitamin deficiencies, including:  Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 6, folic acid, 
MMA, and homocysteine levels will be performed at the times indicated in Table 3 .  
Abnormal Vitamin B 12of questionable clinical significance (indeterminate or low normal

for determination of B 12deficiency prior to entry into the study.  Only labs at Visit [ADDRESS_1282634] perform this lab panel and any other assessment that the Investigator feels is appropriate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms.  Thyroid function tests will be done at Visit 1 only.
Pregnancy Testing
●WOCBP must have a negative serum/urine pregnancy test result at Screening, 
and a negative serum/urine pregnancy test at Study Day 1.  Monthly pregnancy 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282635] dose and 
until 5 × the half-life of the [COMPANY_013] product.
●Subjects with borderline pregnancy tests at Screening must have a serum pregnancy test ≥ 3 days later to document continued lack of a positive result.
●Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently 
surgically sterile as defined above) at Screening do not require pregnancy testing at any time.
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
The MoCA has been widely utilized in clinical settings to study cognition in PD.  It was 
originally developed as a screening tool to assess mild cognitive impairment in the general population.  The MoCA will be administered to assess for cognitive impairment and w ill 
be administered at Visits 3, 6, 7 and 8.  The scale assesses seven cognitive domains, including visuospatial/executive, naming, memory/delayed recall, attention, language, abstraction and orientation.  The maximum total score that can be obtained is 30 and a cut off score of 25/26 on MoCA has demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 90% for individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.  Additionally the movement disorder society has recommended the use of this scale due to its acceptable clinimetric properties
45and diagnostic utility.
Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI)
To monitor for development of intense impulsive behavior, the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI)
46will be administered at the times indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282636]'s impulsivity during the Screening Period is judged to be clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator, they will be excluded from participation in the study and referred for appropriate follow-up care.  Any subject noted to have intense impulsive behavior during the study as assessed by  [CONTACT_912974], or via clinical interview, will be 
evaluated immediately by [CONTACT_737].  The study designated physician should also be notified.  The MIDI will be administered as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282637] 2014-004865-26

Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)47is a systematically administered 
instrument designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal 
events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include 
frequency, duration, controllability, reason for id eation, and deterrents.  The C-SSRS is 
considered a low-burden instrument as it takes less than [ADDRESS_1282638] year, either via 
answering "yes" to question 4 and/or question [ADDRESS_1282639]'s risk.
The "Already Enrolled Subjects" C-SSRS will be the first assessment scale administered 
to the subject.  At each subsequent visit, the "Since Last Visit" C-SSRS scale should be 
administered.
The C-SSRS will be administered at the times outlined in Table 3 .
Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS)
Non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease can result in substantial patient 
burden.  The NMSS is a comprehensive validated tool measuring a broad range of non-motor symptoms in PD patients.  The scale is aimed to be practical and quantitative, encompassing the whole range of non-motor symp toms experienced by [CONTACT_710699].  
The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of these symptoms and is comprised of 30 questions that cover 9 domains of patient symptom experience (cardiovascular/falls,

sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, GI 
tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous [pain, taste/smell, weight change, 
excessive sweating]).48,49  The NMSS measures the burden of non-motor symptoms by 
[CONTACT_912975]; thereby, providing a quantitative measure that captures infrequent but severe symptoms (e.g., hallucinations) and less serious but frequent symptoms (e.g., fatigue, constipation) and provides the overall global burden for patients.  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.  Severity and frequency are rated using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe; major source of distress or disturbance to subject) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent [daily or all the time]) for frequency.  The total NMSS score ranges from [ADDRESS_1282641] in evaluating sleep disturbances, only 3 are endorsed and recommended by [CONTACT_335051].
50  One such scale specific for 
Parkinson's disease is the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), which has been modified to the PDSS-2.  The purpose of the PDSS -2 scale is to characterize the various 
aspects of nocturnal sleep problems in PD patients.  The PDSS-2 instrument has been shown to be reliable, valid, precise, and a potentially treatment responsive tool for measuring nocturnal disabilities and sleep disorders in PD.
51  PDSS-2 consists of 
15 questions evaluating motor and NMS at night and upon wakening, as well as disturbed sleep grouped into 3 domains:  motor symptoms at night (5 items), PD symptoms at night 
(5 items), and disturbed sleep (5 items).  Specifically, questions assess overall sleep

To increase ease of use, the visual analogue scale of the PDSS was transformed into a frequency measure in the PDSS-2.  The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-ty pe scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very 
often]).  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.  The recall period is for the past week.  For this study the PDSS-[ADDRESS_1282643] a current valid Rater Certificate.  The qualified rater will complete the PDSS-2 at the times indicated in Table 3 .
The PDSS-2 will be completed  at the times indicated in Table 3 . 
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)52is an Investigator-used rating 
tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parki nson's disease.  Every effort should be made 
by [CONTACT_912976]'s participation in the study.  The UPDRS assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_10060], trained rater.  To be qualified by [CONTACT_912977], all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater Certificate.
The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:
●Part I – Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
●Part II – Activities of Daily Living
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282644] 2014-004865-26
75
●Part III – Motor Examination
●Part IV – Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)
●Part V – Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
Some sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.  UPDRS total score 
ranges from [ADDRESS_1282645] (total) disability, and 0 no 
disability.  Additionally, Questions 32, 33, and 34 of the UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate dyskinesias.
During Visit 1 the UPDRS Part III will be done during practically defined "Off" time and 
best "On" time.  The practically defined "Off" time UPDRS will be done in the morning prior to the subject taking their first daily dose of anti-PD medication.  The best "On" time rating should be done approximately [ADDRESS_1282646] any morning dose of study drug or PD medications but prior to lunch.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of day throughout the trial.  The "Off" time UPDRS will only be done during Screening; at all other times a complete UPDRS (Parts 1 through 5) will be done during "On" time.
The UPDRS will be obtained at the times indicated in Table 3 .
Health Outcome Measurements
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C)
The CGI-C is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement or Change.  The 
CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories:  very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse.  Proportion of responders who had at least "minimally improved" in CGI-C ratings will be assessed.
A qualified rater will administer the CGI-C to the subject at the times indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282647] 2014-004865-26
76
Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
The PGIC53is a 7-point response scale.  The subject will be asked by [CONTACT_912978] 7-point scale:  
1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much worse, 7 = Very much worse.
The responses of "Very much improved," "Much improved" and "Minimally improved" 
on the PGIC will be used to define responders.  A qualified rater will administer the PGIC to the subject at the times indicated in Table 3 .
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8)
The PDQ-854is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that 
are relevant to subjects with PD, and which may not be included in general health status 
questionnaires.  The PDQ-8 is a self-adminis tered questionnaire.  Each item is scored on 
the following 5-point scale:  0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease 
such as tremors and stiffness.  The results are presented as eight discrete domain scores and as a summary index.  The PDQ-[ADDRESS_1282648] at the times indicated in

Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS)
The Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) is a new scale developed specifically to measure severity in anxiety in Parkinson's disease.  Lack of adequate validation data in the existing anxiety scales led to the development of the PAS.  The PAS is a brief scale designed to measure anxiety in PD, rated by [CONTACT_912979].  It contains three dimensions: persistent anxiety, epi[INVESTIGATOR_89915], and avoidance behavior.  It is an easy and brief to

Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)
The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a short, self-report reliable and valid screening instrument for depression in the elderly.  Th e response items are in a "Yes/No" format.  
The GDS was originally developed as a 30-item instrument but it was time-consuming and difficult for some patients to complete hence a 15-item version of the GDS was developed.  The shortened form consists of 15 items chosen from the Geriatric Depression Scale-Long Form (GDS-L).  These [ADDRESS_1282650] to assess depression at Visits 3, 6, 7 and 8.
King's PD Pain Scale
The King's PD Pain Scale is an easy to administer novel clinical PD specific pain scale 
developed with a focus on sub classification of nociceptive and neuropathic pain.  It was specifically developed to assess pain among Parkinson's disease patients since no validated PD specific scales existed to characterize the various types of pain in PD.  The scale consists of seven domains of pain including musculoskeletal, chronic, fluctuation related, nocturnal, oro-facial, local limb pain/edema/swelling and radicular pain.  The scale measures the frequency and severity of these symptoms.  The clinimetric properties

Titration Visits (LCIG Group Only)
Dose Titration Diary and LCIG Prescription Record (LCIG Group Only)
While the subject is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the study staff may use the Dose Titration Diary as a 
tool to achieve dose optimization.  In the event it is used it should be completed hourly until the dose is optimized and then once AM and once PM it will be completed until the subject is discharged.  All adjustments can be recorded on the Dose Titration Diary allowing the Investigator to appropriately adjust, if needed, the following day's morningdose, continuous infusion rate and extra dose until the subject is optimized.
The subject's pump settings for the first infusion of LCIG, the pump settings at the 
conclusion of each calendar day are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
Following the initial titration period, the site should record the subject's pump settings 
(morning dose in mL, continuous infusion rate in mL/hr, and lock level) at the conclusion of each clinic visit on the study drug prescription record.
Subject Dosing Diary (LCIG and OMT Groups)
The subject dosing diary should be completed during the 72-hour period (3 days) prior to 
each clinic visit, as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_1282652] Dosing Diary days in the diary.

5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects may be randomized to one of two treatment groups, OMT or LCIG.
[IP_ADDRESS] OMT
Those subjects randomized to OMT at the end of V3 will continue on their current 
anti-PD medication regimen for the duration of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_912914].  PIs should make any effort to keep all anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS stable for the duration of the study.  Changes to the OMT arm can be made "if medically justified" or if absolutely indicated for safety reasons.  The day after V3 will be consider ed Day [ADDRESS_1282662] at the end of Weeks 2 through 26 respectively.  All data will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the assessments completed as in Table 3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] LCIG
LCIG is supplied as a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa 
monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an aqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethyl cellulose).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a medication  cassette reservoir of [ADDRESS_1282663]-operated pump.  LCIG infusion is administered over a full 16-hour period each day.  At night, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed 
with potable water.
The total daily dose of infusio n LCIG will be composed of three components:  (i) the 
morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses.Subject dosing is determined individually.  The starting total daily dose of LCIG infusion 
after placement of the PEG-J tube will be based solely on the daily dose of the oral levodopa component from the tablets of  levodopa- immediate (IR) taken immediately prior 
to NJ (or PEG-J) placement during the [ADDRESS_1282664] 2014-004865-26
87
would be on LCIG therapy.  The rate of LCIG infusion is typi[INVESTIGATOR_912929] 1 
to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours.  The PEG-J tube s hould be disconnected from the infusion pump 
before bedtime and the tube should be flushed with 20 mL potable water (both the gastric and jejunal port).
The timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and specific instructions to subjects about 
when or how to take the dose will be supplied to the subject.  No restrictions are given with relation to the time of LCIG dosing relative to meals.
Initial Dose Titration
The initial infusion w ill be based on calculations described in this section.  Extra doses of 
LCIG may be administered to address immediate medical need throughout the day during 
initial titration and should be carefully recorded on the Dose Titration Diary.
The daily LCIG infusion dose may be adjusted based on the subject's response to the 
previous day's treatment and the amount of, if any of extra LCIG doses required.  If both the Investigator and subject are satisfied with the effectiveness of treatment, then no change in the LCIG infusion dose is require d.  If clinically indicated, changes in the dose 
either upward or downward can be made to further optimize the subject's treatment response.
If at any time during titration the subject develops severe dyskinesia or other 
levodopa-related complications, the LCIG infusion can be paused, if judged absolutely necessary by [CONTACT_737], until symptoms improve to a clinically acceptable level.
Additionally, if at any time during titration, the subject develops a prolonged "Off" state 
that is unsafe or causes the subject unacceptable discomfort, rescue oral LC-IR dose can be administered, if judged necessary by [CONTACT_737], until symptoms improve.

functional "On" time and minimizing the number of "Off" epi[INVESTIGATOR_340173].  This 
optimization also minimizes "On" time with troublesome dyskinesia.  This determinationis made by [CONTACT_737].  
LCIG Infusion
LCIG concentration = 1 mL LCIG contains 20 mg of levodopa and 5 mg carbidopa 
(20 mg/mL).
Morning Dose
A morning dose will be administered as a bolus infusion by [CONTACT_912988][INVESTIGATOR_881095] a 
therapeutic dose level (over approximately 10 to 30 minutes).  This morning dose is generally 5 to 10 mL and corresponds to 100 to 200 mg of levodopa.
The total morning dose typi[INVESTIGATOR_605442]  15 mL (300 mg levodopa).  Subjects are 
not administered a full equivalent of their us ual oral morning dose of levodopa-carbidopa.  
Continuous Maintenance Dose
The Maintenance Dose is adjustable in steps of 2 mg/hour (0.1 mL/hour).  The dose 
should be calculated according to the subject's previous daily intake of levodopa.  The continuous maintenance dose is adjusted individually.  It is usually kept at 2 to 6 mL/hour (40 to 120 mg levodopa/hour).  However, higher doses may be clinically indicated.  During the titration period, the continuous dose can be titrated in a step wise fashion that meets the clinical and medical needs of the subject.  The continuous maintenance dose is first calculated based on the subject's usual total daily dose minus the morning dose.  
During treatment, pump alarms may indicate kinking or knotting of the tube.  
Additionally there may be a sudden deterioration in treatment response with recurring motor fluctuations due to the distal part of the tube becoming displaced from the upper intestine into the stomach.  The locati on of the tube should be determined 
radiographically.  If necessary, the end of the tube can be repositioned to the proximal small intestine and the new placement confirmed radiographically.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282666] is placed on an oral regimen of levodopa IR tablets; the dose prescribed should be based on the dose the subject was receiving just prior to the LCIG infusion interruption and ad just the dose as clinically indicated to 
stabilize the subject.  
Extra LCIG Doses
During initial titration, extra doses may be administered on an hourly basis at the 
Investigator's discretion based on the subject's response.  Subsequently, subjects will be 
allowed to self-administer additional extra doses of LCIG (at intervals of no less than 2 hours) to address immediate medical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.  Extra doses may be given as required if the subject becomes hypokinetic during the day.  If the need for extra doses exceeds [ADDRESS_1282667]'s continuous daily maintenance infusion dose.  After the initial dose setting, fine adjustments of the morning dose, the maintenance dose and extra doses can be made as needed.  
Nasojejunal Tube
LCIG is intended for continuous intestinal ad ministration.  A temporary nasojejunal tube 
may be used initially with the infusion pump to determine if the subject responds 
favorably to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment 
with a permanent PEG-J tube is started.  Only the NJ sets available through this clinical study should be used with LCIG.  The NJ should be inserted by a gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon or interventional radiolog ist.  NJ may also be inserted by [CONTACT_912989].
Following the placement of the NJ it will be n ecessary to perform a radiological check for 
proper tube placement before initiating LCIG. If NJ is placed via the passive method, the

position (which may take around 48 hours and local practice procedures should be 
followed).
Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of the permanent PEG-J tube 
and start titration without the NJ test phase if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. 
Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy with Jejunal Extension (PEG-J)
LCIG will be administered via the components of the percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy – with jejunal extension (PEG-J) set.  Only the PEG-J sets available through this clinical study should be used with LCIG.
A thorough evaluation of the subject's risk of undergoing the PEG-J procedure will be 
performed by [CONTACT_912990]/Exclusion criteria prior to Screen V2.  Subjects deemed unsuitable for the PEG-J procedure will not be enrolled in the study.
The study gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon or qualified radiologist must take 
appropriate steps to evaluate and minimize the risk to subjects undergoing the PEG-J 
procedure including aftercare.  Additional evaluations for safety, other than those required by [CONTACT_760], are permitted at the Investigator's or Study GIs discretion (i.e., additional lab tests).
Placement of the PEG-J will be performed by a qualified gastroenterologist proceduralist, 
surgeon or qualified radiologist experienced with the placement of PEG-J tubes.  Each study site should have one study designated  gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon, or 
qualified radiologist and one backup who has experience with and a thorough knowledge of endoscopy and PEG placement, aspects of PD and neurological patients, placement and 
maintenance of PEG-J tubes, the LCIG Sys tem and any related procedures.  They must 
also participate in study staff guided training or equivalent.

The use of prophylactic antibiotics is required prior to PEG-J procedure.  At minimum, a 
single dose of a 1
stor 3rdgeneration cephalosporin (or an antibiotic with similar coverage) 
must be administered approximately [ADDRESS_1282670] may 
begin initiation and titration of LCIG infusion.  LCIG initiation and titration will be performed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912930] (e.g., at a study site, titration center) with appropriate medical s upervision.  The Sponsor will ensure the 
Investigator and site personnel are trained on LCIG initiation and titration.
The gastric port of the PEG-J s hould not be used for the delive ry of nutrition and/or other 
medications unless judged medically necessary following consultation with the study 
designated physician.  If determined medically necessary, it is imperative that nutrition and/or other medications are delivered only through the gastric port and not the jejunal port.  The gastric port must be properly flushed and maintained as outlined in the provided aftercare procedure instructions for the PEG-J set.
Following the PEG-J placement procedure, aftercar e of the PEG-J system will initially be 
performed by [CONTACT_3665].  Instructi on and confirmation that the subject and/or 
care-partner have a good understanding of proper stoma aftercare and check of the stoma 
is required before discharge.  To ensure adequate adaptation of the stomach and abdominal walls and to reduce PEG-J infections, the aftercare procedure instructions provided by [CONTACT_912991].  During aftercare procedures, it is very 
important not to turn, rotate or twist the jejunal extension tube.
The gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon, or qualified radiologist, or their designated 
qualified personnel will examine the subject's stoma site between Study Day [ADDRESS_1282671]'s progress as an 
outpatient.  The gastroenterologist proceduralist/surgeon will continue to follow the subject's progress as an outpatient.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open label study and all subjects will receive OMT or LCIG in an open-label 
fashion.
An open-label study design is appropriate for the following reasons:
1. LCIG is an approved product with demonstrated efficacy
2. Advanced PD is an orphan populations wi th a limited patient population available 
for recruitment
3. An open-label design ensures that subjects randomized to optimized medical 
therapy do not have to undergo the invasive NJ and PEG-J procedure unnecessarily
4. NJ testing period is not possible in a blinded study5. Per the Package Leaflet, Duodopa is init iated as monotherapy – tapering off of all 
other anti-PD medicati ons besides levodopa at initiation would not be plausible in a 
blinded study
6. The majority of patients are on other anti-PD medications in addition to levodopa 
and those randomized to OMT, would not be able to be maintained on levodopa 
monotherapy for 28 days safely
As there are no approved medications which treat NMS as a whole, this optimized medical therap y population is considered a ppropriate as a comparison group.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
The NMSS was developed to evaluate the severity of individual non-motor symptoms in a patient with Parkinson's disease and to monitor the effect of an intervention on non-motor symptoms.
The PDSS-[ADDRESS_1282680] Population
Levodopa-responsive Pa rkinson's disease patients with severe motor fluctuations and 
hyperkinesia/dyskinesia when available combinations of Parkinson medicinal products have not given satisfactory results are eligible to participate.
[ADDRESS_1282681] been optimized and stabilized during the Screening Period.  For subjects randomized to LCIG, the starting dose of the infusion after placement of the NJ and/or PEG-J tube will be based on the daily dose of the oral levodopa prior to or at the time of study entry.  Subject dosing will be individually optimized.
The total dose/day of LCIG is composed of three individually adjusted doses:  (i) the 
morning dose, (ii) the continuous maintenance dose and (iii) extra doses.  The needs of individual subjects may vary depending on their particular condition and calculation of 
necessary dosing will be individualized based.  The LCIG infusion is expected to infuse over approximately 16 hours each day with a r ate of infusion within the range of 1 to 
10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.  The maximum LCIG dose administered in this st udy should not exceed 200 mg of levodopa/hour for [ADDRESS_1282682]/device after it is released for 
distribution.

●An active pharmacological agent
●Device component(s) (cassette, tubing, pump, connectors, etc.).
Complaints associ ated with any component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.[ADDRESS_1282684] any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end d ate, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possib ility" of being associated with study drug or 
the study device components, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282685] 2014-004865-26
100
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.  Also, fluctuating PD symptoms during titration should not be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_1282686] screening visit (SV1), allowing the subject to arrive at 
the clinic in the "Off" state, will not be regarded as an SAE.  If not associated with worsening of Parkinson's disease symptoms, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912932] a SAE.  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_772404] a Product Complaint, such as a device dislocation without AE (i.e., without health impairment) will not be regarded as an SAE.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912933]/rep lacement should not be  considered an 
SAE.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282687]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are:
●Gastrointestinal and gastrointestinal procedure related events
●Polyneuropathy
●Weight loss
For AESIs, serious and nonserious, meeting pre-defined criteria, specific questionnaires 
will be used to standardize the collecti on of follow-up information.  The AESI 
questionnaires are either sent to the site after Sponsor review or issued within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system once applicable.  The Investigator will email the completed questionnaires to the [COMPANY_013] Neuroscience Safety Management Team or enter the information into the EDC system once applicable.  If a subject develops signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy a standard panel of examinations will be suggested to the Investigator and certain laboratory tests (specified in questionnaire) will be required by [CONTACT_1034].  The Investigator may perform additional other assessments that are deemed appropriate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms based on the presentation of the individual subject.  If weight loss is considered to be clinically significant, preventative measures will be taken to counteract weight loss.
For all AESIs, if the event meets seriousness criteria, the Investigator will report the event 
to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1282689] Information:

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts 
the subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the 
subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or 
life-threatening.
6.1.[ADDRESS_1282691]'s anti-PD medication.
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship. 
No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.

M12-[ADDRESS_1282692] 2014-004865-26
104
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, if the Investigator has not repor ted causality or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_396039], an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_713119].

reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by [CONTACT_1034].  Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing 
basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition (cassette, pump, tubing, etc.).  In instances where a return is requested, every 
effort should be made by [CONTACT_51058] 30 days.  If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an 
estimated date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for [COMPANY_013] in order to enable [COMPANY_013] to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.

8.1.3 Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT dataset unless otherwise specified.  
Comparisons between OMT and LCIG groups will be performed with two-sided tests at the significance level of 0.050.
Unless otherwise specified, the "baseline" for efficacy variables is defined as the last 
assessment taken on or before the day of randomization, and the "final observation" refers to the last non-missing observation in the Treatment Period (including evaluations conducted within [ADDRESS_1282703] dose of study drug for subjects randomized to LCIG).
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis
There are 2 alternative primary efficacy variables, change from baseline to Week 26 for 
NMSS total score and change from baseline to Week 26 for PDSS-2 total score.  Either variable considered statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment is sufficient to declare success of the study.
NMSS Total Score
The NMSS was developed to assess non-motor symptoms in PD.  It is obtained through 
interview and rated by [CONTACT_913006].  It contains 30 questions grouped into 
9 domains:  cardiovascular (2 items), sleep/f atigue (4 items), mood/cognition (6 items), 
perceptual problems /hallucinations (3 items), attention/memory (3 items), gastrointestinal 
tract (3 items), urinary (3 items), sexual function (2 items), and miscellaneous (4 items).  Each question is scored with respect to severity and frequency.  Severity is rated on a 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282704] 2014-004865-26
113
scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe.  Frequency is rated on a 
scale where 1 = rarely, 2 = often, 3 = frequent and 4 = very frequent.  Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency.  Domain scores and a total score are obtained by [CONTACT_179124].
PDSS-2 Total Score
The PDSS-2 was developed from the PDSS based upon the need for a 
treatment-measuring tool containing PD-specif ic sleep disorders.  The instrument was 
extended to address specific sleep disturbances such as RLS, akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea.  The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often]).  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.
Primary Analysis Model and Multiplicity Adjustment
The primary efficacy analysis model is a lik elihood-based mixed-effects model repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis of the change from baseline for each post-baseline 
observation using all observed data.  The model will include fixed, categorical effects for treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by -visit interaction, wi th continuous fixed 
covariates for baseline score and the baseline score-by-visit interaction.  The primary comparison will be the contrast between LCIG and optimized oral treatment at the Week 26 Visit.
The two-sided Pvalues obtained from the MMRM m odel for NMSS total score change 
from baseline to Week 26 and PDSS-2 total score change from baseline to Week 26 will 
be adjusted for multiplicity using the Hoc hberg procedure.  This method controls the 
family-wise error rate (FWER) at a pre-specified significance level (alpha = 0.05).  Specifically, the following steps will be followed:
●If the larger of the 2 Pvalues is ≤ 0.05 (i.e., both Pvalues are ≤ 0.05), both 
endpoints are considered statistically significant.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-[ADDRESS_1282705] 2014-004865-26
114
●If the larger of the 2 Pvalue is > 0.05, then compare the smaller Pvalue with 
0.025.  The second endpoint is statistically significant if the Pvalue is ≤ 0.025; 
otherwise, neither endpoint is considered statistically significant.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analysis
Secondary Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variables
ANCOVA analyses will be carried out on change from baseline to final NMSS total score 
and change from baseline to final PDSS-[ADDRESS_1282706] (BOCF) will be applied to subjects who do not have post-randomization assessment of NMSS or PDSS-2.
Key Secondary Efficacy Variables
Key secondary endpoints will consist of the following validated scales:
●UPDRS Part II score
●CGI-C
●PDQ-[ADDRESS_1282707] 2014-004865-26

Other Secondary Efficacy Variables
Other secondary endpoints include:
●NMSS domain scores
●PDSS-2 domain scores
●UPDRS total score, Part I score, Part III score, Part IV score
●Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) total and subscale scores
●King's PD Pain Scale total and domain scores
These variables will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the primary analysis.  
For the analysis on PGIC, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1282708] at the significance level of 0.05.
Unless otherwise specified, the treatment group differences in continuous safety variables 
(e.g., change from baseline to final observation on laboratory tests) will be assessed using an ANOVA model with the term of treatment, and the treatment group differences in binary safety variables will be evaluated using a Fisher's exact test.
[IP_ADDRESS] OMT and LCIG Study Drug Exposure
The duration of OMT exposure will be calculated for each subject as the date of the last 
visit minus the date of random ization.  The duration of LCIG study drug exposure will be 
calculated for each subject as the date of the last dose of LCIG study drug minus the date of the first dose of LCIG study drug plus 1.  The duration of OMT and LCIG study drug exposure will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects with non-missing data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_448409] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event for a given MedDRA PT will be counted only once for that term.  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event within an SOC will be counted only once for the SOC total.  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event will be counted only once in the overall adverse event total.
Each adverse event will be categorized by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe) and by 
[CONTACT_78487] (reasonable possib ility, or no reasonable possibility).  
Detailed search criteria for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be defined in a SAP prior to database lock.
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as:
●For OMT group:  any adverse event that begins or worsens in severity the day 
after randomization and within [ADDRESS_1282710] visit.
●For the LCIG group:  any adverse event that begins or worsens in severity from the day of the initial device placement (NJ or PEG-J)  through Week 26 
Visit for those subjects continuing to LCIG commercial treatment, or through 30 days after final device removal for those subjects not continuing LCIG commercial treatment.

adverse events and serious adverse events with onset after day of randomization and before day of initial device placement for the LCIG group, as well as adverse events during the transition period for LCIG subjects continuing LCIG commercial treatment will also be summarized.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Variables
For each continuous clinical laboratory variable, analyses of the mean change from 
baseline to each scheduled visit and to the minimum, maximum and final value will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].
Clinical laboratory observations will be categorized as normal, low, or high relative to the 
reference (normal) range associated with the laboratory that performed the assay.  For each clinical laboratory variable with a reference range, shift tables will be prepared for reference range category shifts from bas eline to minimum, maximum and final value.
Criteria for potentially clinically significant (P CS) values will be pre-specified for 
selected laboratory variables in an SAP prior to database lock.  For each variable, a summary of the number and percentage of subjects who have at least one post-baseline observation that meets the PCS criteria and is more extreme than their baseline value will be provided.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Sign Variables and Weight
For each vital sign and weight variable, analyses of the mean change from baseline to 
each scheduled visit and to the final value will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  For this analysis, the average of multiple observations on the same day will be calculated and treated as the observation for the day.  For LCIG subjects' visits with multiple observations scheduled on the same day, the post-i nfusion change from the day's 
pre-infusion baseline will be summarized for each scheduled time point.

Criteria for potentially clinically significant (PCS ) values will be pre-specified for 
selected vital sign and weight variables prior to database lock.  For each variable, a 
summary of the number and percentage of subjects who have at least one post-baseline observation that meets the PCS criteria and is m ore extreme than their baseline value will 
be provided.
[IP_ADDRESS] ECG Variables
For each ECG variable, analyses of the mean change from baseline to each scheduled visit 
and to the final value will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  For this analysis, the average of multiple observations on the same day will be calculated and treated as the observation for the day.  For LCIG subjects' visits with multiple observations scheduled on the same day, the post-infusion change  from the day's pre -infusion bas eline will be summarized for 
each scheduled time point.

8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 88 subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1282714] deviation of 24.  Results from Zibetti et al (2013) showed that the improvement in PDSS-[ADDRESS_1282715] deviation was not provided and is estimated to be 12.2 assuming the correlation between baseline and 
follow-up visits is 0.5.
The significance level for this study is 0.05.  For sample size determination, it is assumed 
that the improvement in the OMT group is 33% of the LCIG group, i.e., the improvement is 8.[ADDRESS_1282716] 90% power to declare statist ical signif icance on at least one of these 2 
alternative primary endpoints after multiplicit y adjustment using Hochberg procedure.  It 
is further assumed that 10% of randomized subjects in either treatment group will not provide post-ra ndomization efficacy assessment.  A dditional simulations showed that 44 
subjects per group will provide 90% power in the sensitivity analysis using baseline observation carried forward for subjects without post-randomization assessment.  
Therefore the total planned enrollment is decided to be 88 subjects.

NUMBER  OF SITES  20 
RATIONALE  18F-fluciclovine   PET/CT  has  the potential   to  improve  medical   care and 
quality  of life among  men with prostate  cancer  in several  ways.  First,  
identification  of disease  in the prostate  bed and/or  regional  nodes  would  
provide  evidence  in support  of salvage  radiation  treatment,  and help to plan 
radiotherapy.  In addition,  the absence  of distant  disease  by 18F-fluciclovine  
PET/CT  in patients  would  preserve salvage local  therapy  as a clinical  option  
beyond  the time typi[INVESTIGATOR_638425].  Second,  identification  of distant  disease  at 
the time of consideration  of salvage  radiation  therapy  would  allow  patients  
to forego  radiation  that would  ultimately  be futile.  This would  spare  those  
patients  radiation -induced  side effects  such as impaired  recovery  of 
continence,  impaired  recovery  of erectile  function,  and diarrhea.  Finally,  the 
absence  of disease  detection  on a sensitive  imaging  modality  in patients  with 
a rising  PSA would  have the potential  to delay  initiation  of systemic  
androgen  deprivation  therapy,  a treatment  strategy  that causes  a number  of 
morbid  side effects  that are detrimental  to quality  of life. 
STUDY  DESIGN  This is a prospective  phase  IIIb study  to assess  the impact  on patient  
management  of 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  in patients  with rising  prostate  
specific  antigen  (PSA)  after initial  prostate  cancer  treatment.  
PRIMARY  OBJECTIVE  To measure  the fraction  of patients  for whom 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  alters  
intended  management  through  detection  of disease  after curative -intent  
treatment  in a population  of men with elevated  PSA levels  indicative  of 
persistent  or recurrent  prostate  cancer  and negative  or equivocal  findings  on 
standard -of-care diagnostic  imaging  tests.

SECONDARY  
OBJECTIVES  1. To measure  the fraction  of patients  for whom  18F-fluciclovine  
PET/CT  leads  to a change  of actual  management  by [CONTACT_638442]  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT.  
2. To estimate  the fraction  of patients  in whom  18F-fluciclovine  
PET/CT  yields  evidence  of recurrent  disease  on the basis  of imaging  
results.  
3. To estimate  1) the rates of detecting  regionally  recurrent  disease  
(i.e., prostatic  bed-only and/or  pelvic  disease  outside  of the bed) and 
2) the rate of detecting  distant  metastases  (i.e., bone  metastases,  
visceral  metastases,  or non-regional  nodal  metastases)  with 18F- 
fluciclovine  PET/CT  in the study  population.  
4.  To determine  1) the Positive  Predictive  Value  (PPV)  of 18F- 
fluciclovine  PET/CT  to detect  regionally  recurrent  disease  and 2) the 
PPV of 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  to detect  distant  metastases  in the 
study  population  in patients  who undergo  optional  biopsy  of 18F- 
fluciclovine  PET/CT  findings  or have documentation  of disease  
status  based  on other  imaging  and/or  follow -up data. 
5.   To explore  differences  in estimated  cost of treatment  plans  
determined  prior  to and following  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT

 2. The rate of detection  of any disease  site by 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  
in the study  population.  
3. The rate of detection  of 1) prostatic  bed and other  pelvic disease  and 
2) distant  metastases  (i.e., bone metastases,  visceral  metastases,  or

Planned  Interim  Analyses  An interim analysis of a subset of study results on all enrolled subjects may 
be subm tted for potential public p resentation prior to completion of all data 
collection and analyses. As trial design will not be modified as a result of this 
interim analysis, no adjustment to the type I error is required . 
STATISTICS 
Primary  Analysis  Plan For the evaluation  of the primary  endpoint  (i.e., impact  on therapy),  
questionnaires  obtained  pre- and post- 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  will be 
compared  to calculate  the fraction  of cases  with a change  in management  
(versus  no change  in planned  management).  The 95% confidence  interval  
will be calculated  using  the Exact  method  for a binomial  distribution.  
Rationale  for Number  of 
Subjects  Assuming  a  prevalence  rate of positive  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  of 
approximately  40%,  of which  30% will be expected  to change  the 
physician’s  intended  management  plan and binding  of the 95% CI width  at 
0.20 (i.e., half –length  at 0.10),  89 18F-fluciclovine  positive  patients  will be 
needed  for the assessment  of our primary  aim. After  taking  into account  the 
random  nature  of the observed  numbers  of patients  meeting  the clinical  
criteria  in a prospective  study,  and potential  data loss, provide  a 90% 
probability  of yielding  the required  number  of patients  for the primary  
comparison  it is planned  to enroll at least 292 and up to 330 patients  into the 
study  in order  to obtain  89 evaluable  patients.

CONFIDENTIAL  Blue Earth  Diagnostics  Protocol  BED003  Version  4.0 Version  Date: [ADDRESS_853831] -of- 
care diagnostic  imaging  studies  improves  disease -specific  survival  and overall  survival,  (1) but relapse  
remains  a significant  problem.  Biochemical  failure  rates despi[INVESTIGATOR_638429] 30% 
with intermediate -risk disease  (2) and 50%  with high-risk disease.  (3) Some  of these  relapses  are 
attributable  to distant  metastases  not detected  by [CONTACT_638445].  Others  are attributable  to 
locally  persistent  disease  in the region  of the prostate  or proximate  nodes.  Management  of recurrent  
disease  after curative -intent  local  therapy  optimally  requires  disease  localization.  
Standard -of-care staging  imaging  for prostate  cancer  as recommended  by [CONTACT_638446]  99mTc-MDP  bone  scintigraphy  and pelvic  imaging  
with CT or MRI.  (4) In the setting  of early  biochemical  relapse  after prostatectomy,  although  used to help 
define  the extent  of disease,  these  studies  are generally  uninformative.  As a result,  clinicians  must often  
decide  for or against  further  local  therapy  (e.g.,  salvage  external  beam  radiation  therapy  for biochemical  
recurrence  after prostatectomy)  as guided  by [CONTACT_419122] -based  probabilities  rather  than anatomic  
localization.  A more  sensitive  imaging  modality  that could  offer anatomic  localization  within  the clinical  
setting  of early  PSA relapse  would  better  inform  treatment  decisions  and improve  the management  of 
patients  with apparent  recurrence  based  on PSA levels.  
Prostate  cancer  functional  imaging  with PET is presently  used on a limited  basis.  Widely  available,  PET 
or PET/CT  with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  is not standard  as FDG  uptake  is usually  low in prostate  
cancer  prior  to the development  of castration -resistant  disease.  18F-sodium  fluoride  PET is more  sensitive  
than standard  99mTc-MDP  bone  scintigraphy,  but both methods  are non-specific  and do not image  cancer  
outside  of the skeleton.  Acetate - and choline -based  PET tracers  have been the subject  of study  but are not 
broadly  approved  and available.  PET or PET/CT  with the experimental  L-leucine  analog  18F-fluciclovine  
has demonstrated  promise  and is the subject  of this experimental  protocol.

operating  characteristics  in over one hundred  study  subjects  with recurrent  prostate  cancer  after curative - 
attempt  primary  therapy  (see Figure)  (5,6,7). Dosimetry  has previously  been  described  and is notable  for a 
favorable  pelvic  imaging  profile  because  of low levels  of uptake  within  the urinary  bladder.  18F- 
fluciclovine  PET/CT  has demonstrated  approximately  90% sensitivity  and 40-67% specificity  for 
detection  of cancer  in the prostate  bed. It has demonstrated  55-100%  sensitivity  and more  than 95% 
specificity  for the detection  of disease  outside  of the prostate  bed. Multi -center  study  is needed  to 
determine  the clinical  impact  of localization  of suspected  prostate  cancer  recurrence  by 18F-fluciclovine  
PET/CT,  specifically  the impact  on patient  management.

cancer  in a multi -institution  study.  We hypothesize  that by [CONTACT_638447]—either  in regional  lymph  nodes  or distant  disease  sites,  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  will impact  the 
approach  to patient  management.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_638430],  and a combination  of additional  focal  therapy  such as radiotherapy,  cryotherapy,  and/or  
systemic  therapy  in patients  treated  initially  with local  radiotherapy  or brachytherapy.  We propose  a study  
of men who have  undergone definitive  treatment  of localized  prostate  cancer  (e.g. by [CONTACT_85269],  local  
radiotherapy,  brachytherapy)  and are presenting  with rising  PSA levels  indicative  of recurrent  or persistent  
disease.  We have  chosen  to study patients  without  evidence  o f  disease  (or with equivocal  findings)  
by [CONTACT_638448]  (bone  scintigraphy  and CT or MRI)  and with PSA levels  in the range  where  
imaging  findings  outside  the prostatic  bed would  be expected  to have a significant  impact  on treatment.  
Study  participants  with negative  or equivocal  conventional  staging  studies  (99mTc-MDP  bone  scintigraphy  
/NaF PET -CT (dependent on standard of care at the institution) and abdominal -pelvic  CT or MRI)  will undergo  
18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT.  
 
 
2 STUDY  RATIONALE  
 
This study  has the potential  to improve  management  of a common  disease  state (biochemically  recurrent  
prostate  cancer)  within  the most  common  cancer  among  men.  If successful,  it will establish  an imaging  
strategy  that is demonstrated  to appropriately  modify  care compared  to current  standard  imaging  
approaches.  Single  center  experience  of a similar  study  was reported  at the SNMMI  meeting  in 2015  (11). 
They  reported  initial  findings  from  an ongoing  randomized  study  in which  24/54  patients  with rising  PSA 
and negative  pelvic  MRI and 99mTc-MDP  bone  scan were  randomized  to receive  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  
before  definitive  treatment.  In these patients  6/23 had changes  made  to their radiation  fields  as a result  of 
the PET/CT;  1 had the offer  of radiotherapy  withdrawn.  Overall  in these  early  results  7/24 patients  
(29.2%)  had the radiotherapy  decision  modified  by [CONTACT_638449]/CT  scan.  If these  results  can be 
confirmed  in a multi -center  study  there is the potential  to improve  medical  care and  quality  of life among  
men with prostate  cancer  in several  ways.  First,  identification  of disease  in the prostate  bed and/or  
regional  nodes  would  provide  evidence  in support  of salvage  radiation  treatment,  and help to plan 
radiotherapy.  In addition,  the absence  of distant  disease  by 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  in patients  with a 
PSA ≥ 1 ng/mL  would  preserve  salvage  local  therapy  as a clinical  option  beyond  the time typi[INVESTIGATOR_638431].  Second,  identification  of distant  disease  at the time of consideration  of salvage  radiation  therapy  
would  allow  patients  to forego  radiation  that would  ultimately  be futile.  This would  spare  those  patients

enrolment  criteria  for details  of eligibility).  Consenting  participants  will be imaged  with 18F-fluciclovine  
PET/CT.  Site clinicians  will manage  study  subjects  per standard  practices  and will document  any change  
in treatment  based  on review  of 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  findings.  Rates  of disease  detection  
(radiographic -only,  and pathologically  confirmed)  will be described.  
 
 
2.1 Risk -Benefit  Assessment  
Benefits  
The research  scans  may provide  further  clinical information  regarding  the patient’s  disease  status  that 
may not have  been  appreciated  using  other  standard  of care tests.  If such information  arises,  this will be 
reported  back to the responsible  clinician  to help direct  the patient’s  further  management.  This may 
provide  a direct  benefit  to the subject.  
Risks  
The risks from  the imaging  studies  to subjects  mainly  relate  to the intravenous  injection  and the radiation  
emitted  by [CONTACT_638450].  Intravenous  injection  carries  a small risk of infection  and 
hematoma.  
 
The mean  effective dose per unit administered  activity  of 18F-fluciclovine  is 22.1µSv/MBq  (8). An 
administered  activity  of 10mCi  (370 MBq)  will result  in an effective  dose of 8.2mSv.  The maximum  
effective  dose due to the CT transmission  scan will vary from  site to site, but as a guide  a dose of 7 mSv 
would  be expected  (details  of scanner -specific  CT effective  doses  will be given  in the Study  Imaging  
Manual).   The effective  dose due to the CT acquisition  will be in accordance  with ALARA  (As Low As 
Reasonably  Achievable)  principles.  The total dose of 15.2mSv  is in line with other  common  nuclear  
medicine  procedures.  
 
As with all imaging  techniques  there  is the risk that the PET/CT  scan may provide  a false positive  image  
(giving  the appearance  of cancer)  in sites where  it is not present,  due to other  events  in the body  such as 
inflammation  or false negative  (failing  to detect  a nidus  of cancer).  Thus  patients  should  continue  to be 
reviewed  and may require  other  investigations,  including  biopsy,  to confirm  scan findings.  
 
3 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary  objective  is to measure  the fraction  of patients  for whom  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  alters  
patient  treatment  through  detection  of disease  after curative -intent  treatment  in a population  of men with 
elevated  PSA levels  indicative  of persistent  or recurrent  prostate  cancer  and negative  or equivocal  findings  
on standard -of-care diagnostic  imaging  tests.

3.2 Secondary  Objectives  
1. To measure  the fraction  of patients  for whom 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  leads  to a change  of actual  
management  by [CONTACT_638451]  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT.  
2. To estimate  the fraction  of patients  in whom  18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  yields  evidence  of recurrent  
disease  on the basis  of imaging  results.  
3. To estimate  1) the rates of detecting  regionally  recurrent  disease  (i.e., prostatic  bed-only and/or  pelvic  
disease  outside  of the bed) and 2) the rate of detecting  distant  metastases  (i.e., bone  metastases,  
visceral  metastases,  or non-regional  nodal  metastases)  with 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  in the study  
population.  
4. To determine  1) the PPV of 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  to detect  regionally  recurrent  disease  and 2) the 
PPV of 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  to detect  distant  metastases  in the study  population  in patients  who 
undergo  optional  biopsy  of 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  findings  or have documentation  of disease  status  
based  on other  imaging  and/or  follow -up data. For soft tissue  disease  these  calculations  will be 
limited  to those  patients  who undergo  a confirmatory  biopsy  and for bone  disease  those with 
confirmatory  findings  on MRI any time during  the 6-month  follow  up. The denominator  for the 
analysis  will be [lesions  biopsied  + bone  lesions].

11 IMAGING  PROTOCOL  
 
11.1 PET/CT Scanner  
A dedicated  hybrid  PET/CT  scanner  is mandatory.  The selected  PET/CT  scanner  must  be qualified  by [CONTACT_638457] -corrected  PET/CT  images.  The ability  to calculate  SUVs  is also mandatory.  
PET/MR  scanners  are not approved  for use on this study.  
 
11.2 18F-fluciclovine  injection  administration  
A venous  cannula  will be inserted,  preferably  in the right arm, and the participant  will receive  10 mCi 
±20%  18F-fluciclovine  injection  diluted  up to 10mL  injected  via the cannula  with arms  down,  as an IV 
bolus injection  followed  by 10mL  flush  with normal  saline  solution.  The participant  will then be 
positioned  supi[INVESTIGATOR_638436],  with the arms  above  the head (if possible),  and will be scanned  in the 
direction  of proximal -thigh  to skull  base.  The time from  end of injection  of 18F-fluciclovine  injection  to 
the start of imaging  should  be 3 to 5 minutes  with a goal of 4 minutes.  
 
11.3 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  acquisition  
For the PET acquisition,  participants  will be imaged  for approximately  [ADDRESS_853858] acquisition,  
an unenhanced  (no IV contrast)  CT will be employed.  Further  details  on the PET/CT  acquisition  are given  
in the Study  Imaging  Manual.  
 
11.4 Image  Transfer  
Following  the completion  of PET/CT  imaging  at the study  site, the scan data will be sent to the ACR  
Imaging  Core  Laboratory  using  either  the ACR  TRIAD  software,  by [CONTACT_638458],  or on physical  media  by [CONTACT_30367].  Full details  are in the Study  Imaging  Manual.  
 
11.5 18F-fluciclovine  image  analysis  
Image  interpretation  will be based  on guidelines  derived  from  an international  18F-fluciclovine  Reader  
Consensus  Meeting  held in June 2014  (10).  All readers  will undergo  training  in interpretation  of 18F- 
fluciclovine  PET/CT  scans,  and will have a training  set available  for reference.  
Primary  evaluation  and reporting  of the PET/CT  scan will be site-based  (as per standard  of care).  Support  
for the local  reader  can be provided  on request  by [CONTACT_638459]-Chairs  as listed  in the 
protocol.  The report  provided  to the treating  physician  and recorded  in the eCRF  will be that of the Site 
Investigator.  The revised  treatment  decision  will be made  on the report  of the Nuclear  Medicine  physician.  
 
 
12 ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING AND  DOCUMENTATION  
 
12.1 Adverse  Events  
An adverse  event  (AE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a clinical  investigation  of a patient  
administered  a pharmaceutical  product  and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with the 
treatment.  An AE is therefore  any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  
finding),  symptom  or disease temporally  associated  with the administration  of an investigational  product,  
whether  or not related  to that investigational  product.   An unexpected  AE is one of a type not identified  in 
LOCATE  30 of 39 
CONFIDENTIAL  Blue Earth  Diagnostics  Protocol  BED003  Version  4.0 Version  Date: 07 June 2017   
  
 
nature,  severity,  or frequency  in the current  Investigator’s  Brochure  or of greater  severity  or frequency  
than expected  based  on the information  in the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
The Investigator  will probe,  via discussion  with the subject,  for the occurrence  of AEs during  each subject  
visit and record  the information  in the site’s  source  documents.  Adverse  events  will be recorded  in the 
patient  eCRF.  Adverse  events  will be described  by [CONTACT_24109]  (start  and stop dates  and times),  severity,  
outcome,  treatment  and relation  to study  drug,  or if unrelated,  the cause.  
AE Severity  
The National  Cancer  Institute’s  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  
4.3 (June  14, 2010)  will be used to assess  and grade  event  severity,  including  laboratory  abnormalities  
judged  to be clinically  significant.  The severity  grading  is provided  below  (Table  1). 
Table 1.  CTCAE  (V4.03)  AE Severity  Grading  
 
Severity  (Toxicity  Grade)  Description  
Grade  1 Mild;    asymptomatic    or   mild   symptoms;    clinical   or   diagnostic  
observations  only;  intervention  not indicated.  
Grade  2 Moderate;   minimal,   local  or  non-invasive   intervention   indicated;  
limiting  age-appropriate  daily  activities.  * 
Grade  3 Severe  or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3526];  disabling;  
limiting  self-care. ** 
Grade  4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
Grade  5 Death  related  to AE 
*Daily  activities  refer to preparing  meals,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2852],  using  the telephone,  managing  
money,  etc. 
** Self-care refers  to bathing,  dressing  and undressing,  feeding  self, using  the toilet,  taking  medications,  
and not bedridden.  
If the experience  is not covered  in the modified  criteria,  the guidelines  shown  in Table  2 below  will be 
used to grade severity.  It should  be pointed  out that the term “severe”  is a measure  of intensity  and that a 
severe  event  is not necessarily  serious.  
Table  2.  AE Severity  Grading  
 
Severity  (Toxicity  Grade)  Description  
Mild  (1) Transient  or mild discomfort;  no limitation  in activity;  no medical  
intervention  or therapy  required.  The subject  may be aware  of the sign 
or symptom  but tolerates  it reasonably  well. 
Moderate  (2) Mild   to  moderate   limitation   in  activity,   no  or  minimal   medical  
intervention/therapy  required.  
Severe  (3) Marked  limitation  in activity,  medical  intervention/therapy  required,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638437].  
Life-threatening  (4) The subject  is at risk of death  due to the adverse  experience  as it 
occurred.  This does not refer to an experience  that hypothetically  might  
have  caused  death  if it were  more  severe.

Adverse  Event  Relationship  to Study Drug  
The relationship  of an AE to study  drug will be assessed  using  the following  guidelines  in Table  
3. 
Table  3.  AE Relationship  to Study  Drug  
 
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously  known  toxicity  of agent;  or an event  that follows  a reasonable  temporal  
sequence  from  administration  of the drug;  that follows  a known  or expected  response  
pattern  to the suspected  drug;  that is confirmed  by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_405039];  and that is not explained  by [CONTACT_638460].  
Probably  An event  that follows  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the 
drug;  that follows  a known  or expected  response  pattern  to the suspected  drug;  that is 
confirmed  by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_638438];  and that is unlikely  to be 
explained  by [CONTACT_7269]’s  clinical  state or by [CONTACT_405058]. 
Possibly  An event  that follows  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the 
drug;  that follows  a known  or expected  response  pattern  to that suspected  drug;  but 
that could  readily  have been  produced  by a number  of other  factors.  
Unrelated  An event  that can be determined  with certainty  to have no relationship  to the study  
drug. 
 
12.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is defined  as any adverse  event  occurring  at any dose that results  in any of the following  
outcomes:  
 death  
 a life-threatening  adverse  experience  
 inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]  
 a persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
 a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Other  important  medical  events  may also be considered  an SAE when,  based  on appropriate  medical  
judgment,  they jeopardize  the subject  or require  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed.  
 
 
Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
Study  sites will document  all SAEs  that occur  (whether  or not related  to study  drug)  on an SAE  Report  
Form.  The collection  period  for all SAEs  will begin  after informed  consent  is obtained  and end after 
procedures  for the final study  visit have  been  completed.

[ADDRESS_853861]  safety  and primary  endpoint  criteria.  
Protocol  violations  for this study  include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
 Failure  to meet inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
 Use of a prohibited  concomitant  medication  
 Use of a camera  which  is not validated  for the study  or using  an imaging  technique  different  to that 
described  in Section  11 
Failure  to comply  with Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  guidelines  will also result  in a protocol  violation.  
The Sponsor  will determine  if a protocol violation  will result  in withdrawal  of a subject.  
When  a protocol  violation  occurs,  it will be discussed  with the investigator  and a Protocol  Violation  Form  
detailing  the violation  will be generated.  This form  will be signed  by a Sponsor  representative  and the 
Investigator.  A copy  of the form  will be filed in the site’s  regulatory  binder  and in the Sponsor’s  files.  
 
 
14 STATISTICAL  METHODS  AND  CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior  to the analysis  of the final study  data,  a detailed  Statistical  Analysis  Plan (SAP)  will be written  
describing  all analyses  that will be performed.  The SAP will contain  any modifications  to the analysis  
plan described  below.  
 
Adverse  event  rates will be coded  by [CONTACT_638462].  Adverse  events  will 
be tabulated  and will include  the number  of patients  for whom  the event  occurred,  the rate of occurrence,  
and the severity  and relationship  to study  drug.  
 
14.1 Analysis  of Primary  Endpoint  
For the evaluation  of the primary  endpoint  (i.e., impact  on therapy),  questionnaires  obtained  pre- and 
post-18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  will be compared  to  calculate  the fraction   of  cases   with a  change  in 
management  (versus  no change  in planned  management).  The 95% confidence  interval  will be calculated  
using  the Exact  method  for a binomial  distribution.  
 
 
LOCATE  33 of 39 
CONFIDENTIAL  Blue Earth  Diagnostics  Protocol  BED003  Version  4.0 Version  Date: [ADDRESS_853862]-18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  to calculate   the fraction  
of cases  with a change  in management  (versus  no change  in planned  management).  For the estimation  
of detection  rate, the proportion  of the 18F-fluciclovine  -PET/CT  positive  results,  95% confidence  interval  
will be calculated  using  the Exact  method  for a binomial distribution.  
 
For each patient  a comparison  will be made  of the results  of the 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  results,  any 
histopathology  results,  results  of any other  imaging  and also for the clinical  response  to treatment(s)  
(standard  of truth)  by [CONTACT_638463].  The PPV,  NPV,  sensitivity  and specificity  will be calculated,  
where  possible,  at lesion  or regional  or patient  level.  The PPV will be calculated  separately  for patients  
undergoing  optional  biopsy  for (1) regional  disease  and (2) distant  disease.  The 95% confidence  interval  
will be calculated  using  the Exact  method  for a binomial  distribution.  The Adjudication  Panel  will 
follow  the Adjudication  Manual  that will prospectively document  the processes  to be used to determine  
a decision  concerning  the result  of the 18F-fluciclovine  PET/CT  scan vs standard  of truth.  
 
Rates  of disease  detection  (radiographic  only and confirmed  by [CONTACT_638444])  will be described  
 
14.3 Interim  Analysis  
When the study recruits the required number of 18F-fluciclovine  -PET/CT   positive patients, accrual will be 
stopped .  A corresponding interim analysis for the primary aim will be planned a nd the study results will be 
submitted for potential public presentation prior to completion of all data collection and analyses.   As 
subject recruitment will have been  completed and the trial design will not be modified as a result of this 
interim anal ysis, no adjustment to the type I error is required . 
 
14.4 Sample Size and Randomization  
The primary  objective  of this study  is to measure  the fraction  of patients  for whom  18F-fluciclovine  - 
PET/CT  alters  intended  management  plan.  The sample  size consideration  will be primarily  based  on 
binding  the width  of its 95% confidence  interval,  i.e., precision  analysis.  The prevalence  rate of positive  
18F-fluciclovine  -PET/CT  findings  in this population  is assumed  to be approximately  40%.  About  30% of 
positive  scans  will be expected  to change  the physician’s  intended  management  plan.  (11).  The goal is to 
accurately  assess  the fraction  of change  in intended  management  in these  FACBC  positive  patients.  The 
table  below  lists the calculated  sample  sizes  with respect  to binding  different  95% CI widths  at the 
proportion  of 30%.  The Clopper -Pearson  Exact  method  was used in PASS  12 (Hintze,  J. (2013).  PASS  
12. NCSS,  LLC.  Kaysville,  Utah,  [LOCATION_003].  www.ncss.com ).

If the goal is to bind the 95% CI width  at 0.20 (i.e., half –length  at 0.10),  then 89 FACBC  positive  
patients  will be needed  for the assessment  of our primary  aim. Since  the positivity  rate is assumed  to be 
around  40% in the study  population,  we need to enroll  223 patients.  Due to the random  nature  of the 
observed  numbers  of patients  meeting  the clinical  criteria  in a prospective  study,  a sample  size correction  
technique  attributed  to (12) was applied.  Our calculation  shows  that after adding  25 extra  patients  (i.e., 
248 in total),  we can be 90% sure to yield  the required  numbers  of patients  meeting  the criteria.  After  
taking  15% of potential  data loss into consideration,  we will need 292 patients  in this study.   This number  
LOCATE  34 of 39 
CONFIDENTIAL  Blue Earth  Diagnostics  Protocol  BED003  Version  4.0 Version  Date: 07 June 2017   
  
 
will be 1,059  for binding  the 95% CI width  at 0.10,  and 138 for binding  the 95% CI width  at 0.30.  If the 
bandwidth  of 95% CI remains  at 0.20,  but the prevalence  rate of positive  18F-fluciclovine  scans  is lower  
than 0.40, it is estimated  that we may need to enrol  up to [ADDRESS_853863]’s  visit into 
the protocol -specific  electronic  Case  Report  Form  (eCRF)  when  the information  corresponding  to that 
visit is available.  Subjects  will not be identified  by [CONTACT_638464]  (or designee),  but will be identified  by a site number,  subject  
number  and initials.  
 
If a correction  is required  for an eCRF,  the time and date stamp  tracks  the person  entering  or updating  
eCRF  data and creates  an electronic  audit  trail. The Investigator  is responsible  for all information  collected  
on subjects  enrolled  in this study.  All data collected  during  the course  of this study  must  be reviewed  
and verified  for completeness  and accuracy  by [CONTACT_737].  A copy  of the CRF will be provided  to

Any documents  that the IRB/IEC  may need to fulfill  its responsibilities  (such  as protocol,  protocol  
amendments,  Investigator’s  Brochure,  consent  forms,  information  concerning  patient  recruitment,  
payment  or compensation  procedures,  or other  pertinent  information)  will be submitted  to the IRB/IEC.  
The IRB/IECs  written  unconditional  approval  of the study  protocol  and the informed  consent  form  will be 
in the possession  of the Investigator  before  the study  is initiated.  The IRB/IECs  unconditional  approval  
statement  will be transmitted  by [CONTACT_638469]. This approval  must refer to the study  by [CONTACT_638470].  
 
Protocol  and/or  informed  consent  modifications  or changes  may not be initiated  without  prior  written  
IRB/IEC  approval  except  when  necessary  to eliminate  immediate  hazards  to the patients  or when  the 
change(s)  involves  only logistical  or administrative  aspects  of the study.  Such  modifications  will be 
submitted  to the IRB/IEC  and written  verification  that the modification  was submitted  and subsequently  
approved  should  be obtained.  
 
The IRB/IEC  must  be informed  of revisions  to other  documents  originally  submitted  for review;  serious  
and/or  unexpected  adverse  experiences  occurring  during  the study  in accordance  with the standard  
operating  procedures  and policies  of the IRB;  new information  that may affect  adversely  the safety  of the 
patients  of the conduct  of the study;  an annual  update  and/or  request  for re-approval;  and when  the study  
has been completed.  
 
16.3 Informed  Consent  Form  
Informed  consent  will be obtained  in accordance  with the Declaration  of Helsinki,  ICH GCP,  US Code  of 
Federal  Regulations  for Protection  of Human  Subjects  (21 CFR 50.25[a,b],  CFR 50.27,  and CFR  Part 56, 
Subpart  A), the Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA,  if applicable),  and local  
regulations.  
 
The Investigator  will prepare  the informed  consent  form,  assent  and HIPAA  authorization  and provide  the 
documents  to the Sponsor  or designee  for approval  prior  to submission  to the IRB/IEC.  The consent  form  
generated  by [CONTACT_638471]/IEC.  The 
written  consent  document  will embody  the elements  of informed  consent  as described  in the International  
Conference  on Harmonization  and will also comply  with local  regulations.  The Investigator  will send an 
IRB/IEC -approved  copy  of the Informed  Consent  Form  to the Sponsor  (or designee)  for the study  file. 
A properly  executed,  written,  informed  consent  will be obtained  from  each subject  prior  to entering  the 
subject  into the trial. Information  should  be given  in both oral and written  form  and subjects  must  be 
given  ample  opportunity  to inquire  about  details  of the study.  A copy  of the signed  consent  form  (and 
assent)  will be given  to the subject  or legal  representative  of the subject  and the original  will be 
maintained  with the subject’s  records.

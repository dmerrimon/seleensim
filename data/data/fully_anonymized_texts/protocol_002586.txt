Section 2.[ADDRESS_566641] led to a falsely elevated 
improvement in statin -induced myalgia; therefore, further randomized control trials are indicated 
to assess the validity of these findings.  
 
Early in vitro studies have shown the presence of v itamin D receptors (VDR) on muscle cells.[ADDRESS_566642] been shown to decrease with age;11 similarly, increasing age 
is a risk factor for developi[INVESTIGATOR_445511] -induced myalgias.12 Physiologically, vitamin D may directly 
bind to nuclear receptors in muscle tissue to improve m uscle strength or directly increase 
intracellular phosphate concentrations resulting in increased ATP production and hence 
improved muscle functioning.11,13  An alternate theory involves competition of the cytochrome 
P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isozyme that is both responsible for statin metaboli sm and vitamin D 
activation.  It is theorized that in vitamin D deficient states, CYP3A4 preferentially hydroxylates

Reference:  ICH E6: Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance  Section 3.0   Trial Purpose and Hypo thesis  
Purpose:  
Statins are a highly effective therapeutic intervention for lipid optimization.  Compliance is often 
limited by [CONTACT_445518].  The purpose of this study is to test if treatment with 
vitamin D can alleviate statin -induced myopathi c pain in subjects with serum vitamin D levels < 
30ng/mL.   This could provide patients a low cost, low risk intervention that would enhance statin 
compliance.  
 
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that vitamin D therapy will improve statin -induced myopathic symptoms 
compared to placebo.  
 
 
Section 4.0   Trial Design  
4.1 Participant Selection and Overall Trial Design  
Los Angeles based community physicians and the principal investigator’s patients will be 
recruited for the study.  This will serve to attract a primarily urban and ethnica lly diverse 
population of subjects. On ly outpatients will be used for the study.    We will enroll patients with 
an indication for statin therapy that are experiencing benign, mild to moderate myopathic 
symptoms such as: myalgia, myositis and myopathy but not rhabdomyolysis but are still able to 
continue their current statin medication.  Rhabdomyolysis will be ruled out with a serum creatine 
kinase (CK) level < 10 x the upper limit of normal (ULN).  These definitions are based on the 
ACC/AHA/NHLBI guidelines as they are more clearly defined tha n FDA or NLA definitions for 
myopathic symptoms related to statin use (Appendix A).  Clinician interview will determine that 
source of pain is myopathic and that myopathic pain is related to statin use.  Other etiologies of 
myopathic pain will be ruled out  such as; increased physical activity, hypothyroidism, trauma, 
falls, accidents, seizure, shaking chills, infections, carbon monoxide poisoning, polymyositis, 
dermatomyositis, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, or PCP).15  If 
serum vitamin 25 OH D levels are less than 30ng/mL, then the patient will be eligible for the 
study, as these patients are considered vitamin D deficient.  The patient will continue their 
current statin regimen and will be randomized to either the placebo arm or treatment arm, which 
is the Vitamin D arm (Appendix B).  All statin medications will be studied in this trial.  
 
4.2 The primary  aims  of our study include:  
1.  Assess if treatment of vitamin D deficiency improves statin -induced myopathic pain  
2.  Assess if treatment of vitamin D deficiency improves statin tolerance3.  Assess if treatment of 
vitamin D deficiency improves the quality  of life in patients with statin -induced myopathic pain  
 
4.3 The primary outcomes  of our study include:  
1.  Myopathic pain  
2.  Quality of life  
3.  Vitamin 25 OH D levels  
4.  Statin tolerability  
 
These will be measured used the brief pain inventory (Appendi x C), the SF 12 survey (Appendix 
D), serum measurements, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_63720], respectively.   
 
CSMC Office of Research Compliance  
Reference:  ICH E6: Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance   
4.4 The secondary outcomes  of our study include:  
1.  Parathyroid hormone (PTH)  
2.  Calcium  
3.  Lipid profile  
 
PTH and calcium levels are directly dependent on serum 25 OH D levels.  In addition, lipid 
profiles are affected by [CONTACT_445519].   
 
4.5 The modifiable variable  in our study is:  
Number of medications patient is taking that is metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4  enzyme  
 
One of the proposed mechanisms of action in statin -induced myalgia and vitamin D deficiency 
involve competition at the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Therefore, the total amount of CYP3A4 dependent 
medications each patient consumes will be tabulated to assess if  it confounds outcomes at the 
end of the study.  This will be most relevant for those patients who entered the study with a statin 
that is metabolized utilizing the CYP3A4 enzyme (lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin , fluvastatin ).  Because [ADDRESS_566644] review (Appendix E).

(child bearing women) .  To ensure it is safe for the patient to begin the stu dy, the chart will be 
reviewed to ensure baseline laboratory values within the last 6 months are within normal limits: 
creatinine (Cr), calcium (Ca), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), albumin (alb).  Serum thyroid -stimulatin g hormone (TSH) values need to be within 
normal limits within the last [ADDRESS_566647] to be interviewed to assess if they meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria.

clinically documented vitamin D level <30ng/mL within 6 months of study entry during screen.  
It will be determined during the screen that patients’ myalgia symptoms are due to statin therapy 
and that patient is able to continue their current statin medication.  Once all the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, the patient is recru ited into the study and scheduled for their 
first research visit.  At research visit #1, patients will be consented for the study, have  lab work 
drawn for safety  and laboratory outcome measurements (primary and secondary outcomes), 
complete study surveys (S F-12 and BPI), medical history, and medication review documents. 
They will also undergo a physical exam where blood pressure, height, weight, vital signs, 
abdominal and hip circumference measurements will be taken.  The patient will then be 
randomized to ei ther a treatment or placebo group and given the study drug.  The study will be 
double -blinded.  The treatment group will receive Ergocalciferol therapy at 50,000IU for 8 weeks 
while the placebo group will receive a placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_445512].  Patients will be 
asked to continue their current statin. Once serum creatinine , calcium, urine pregnancy  (child 
bearing women)  if indicated and creatine  kinase levels return, likely within the same day, patient 
will be given a phone call and asked to start study drug or placebo for the next 8 weeks.  Patients 
will then be called by [CONTACT_445520]/or coordinator in 1 -2 weeks for a phone follow -up 
where tolerability of study drug will be discussed as well as discussion and documentation of any 
adverse events (AEs).  During this phone call an exit appointment will be scheduled after 
completion of 8 week course of study drug vs placebo.  If patient is unable to tolerate protocol an 
earlier exit visit will be scheduled.   During the exit visit patient will undergo a repeat physical 
exam, complete surveys and medication review, and phlebotomy that will measure  the primary 
outcomes, secondary outcomes, mod ifiable variables, and safety measurements :  creatinine, 
calcium, and creatine kinase levels .  For a temporal summary, please refer to Appendix G.  
 
Section 5.0.   Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects  
Patients experiencing myopathic pain while consuming any statin medication will be approached 
by [CONTACT_445521]. The study will be explained to 
them and if they would like to participate in the study the patient will be given a consent form to

Section   6.0   Treatment of Subjects  
Study Drug  
The intervention under study in this trial will be ergocalciferol, vitamin D2.  Of the 40 patients 
selected for the study, 20 will be randomized to the treatment group while the other 20 will be 
randomized to a placebo group.  During this time they will al so be encouraged to continue taking 
their current medication regimen and supplemental regimen as long as the cumulative Vitamin D 
 
CSMC Office of Research Compliance  
Reference:  ICH E6: Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance  dose is <1000 IU/day.  Vitamin D is currently not a standard medical intervention in the 
treatment of myopathic pain.  Vitamin  D, in this study, is being used to treat patients with low 
serum 25 OH D levels.  In addition, assessing for vitamin D deficiency is not routine and there is 
no consensus on who should be offered therapy; therefore, since the study extends for a short 
period of time, it is safe for deficient patients to be randomized to the placebo arm.  Furthermore, 
upon completion of the study, patients who were vitamin D deficient and randomized to the 
placebo arm will be offered therapeutic doses of vitamin D.  
 
Current ly, there is no consensus on an optimal serum 25 OH -D level in asymptomatic 
insufficient patients.  Optimal serum goals are set based on overt symptoms of deficiency which 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_445513] <15 ng/mL.  Therefore, the current standard of care is to treat patients 
with high dose ergocalciferol to keep levels at least >20ng/mL but ideally >30ng/mL as 
secondary hyperparathyroidism is prevented at these serum concentrations.  Since we are testing 
whether vitamin D supplementation will improve statin -related myalgias in subjects with low 
serum vitamin D levels, we have planned our study feasibility based on a 30ng/mL threshold.  
Ergocalciferol is the current standard of care for treating vitamin D deficiency. Since we are 
using ergocalciferol therapy to tr eat vitamin D deficiency, and because our trial is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
the data will not be submitted to the FDA for consideration of changing the labeled indications 
for ergocalciferol therapy.

typi[INVESTIGATOR_445514] a serum 25 OH D concentration of 100 -140 ng/mL (>250nmol/L),[ADDRESS_566655] of care.19 
 
Statins, although rare, can cause rhabdomyolysis.  This is the main concern when patients 
develop myopathic pain.  If serum CK levels are > [ADDRESS_566656] then the patient is toxic from statin 
therapy, and further therapy with statins should be discontinued.  Pr ior to study initiation, serum 
CK levels will be checked to screen out patients with rhabdomyolysis in whom continuation of 
statins is unsafe.   
 
Section 9.0.       Statistics  
Our goal sample size of enrolled patients is 40, with 20  patients in each arm.  W e approximate 
10% of patients that we approach regarding the study will actually meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria as well as agree to the study; therefore, we estimate that we will have to 
approach approximately 400 patients.

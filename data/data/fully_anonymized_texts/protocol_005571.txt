MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495276] Lantus® (insulin glargine) . A phase 1 PK/PD study comparing 
MYL -1501D with Lantus® sourced from Europe and U.S. demonstrated 
PK and PD equivalence between the 3 products. PK/PD equivalence was 
also demonstrated with MYL-1501D product produced using two 
manufacturing processes (Process V and Process VI).  
 
The aim of this study is to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety 
between M YL-1501D products produced from two manufacturing 
processes  (Process V and Process VI)  in combination with insulin lispro 
in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) . 
Primary 
Objectives To test whether M YL-1501D product from  Process VI once daily is 
non-inferior to MYL -1501D product from Process V once daily based on 
change in HbA1c from baseline to week 18  when administered in 
combination with mealtime insulin lispro.  
Primary 
endpoints  The primary efficacy endpoint is change in HbA1c from baseline to week 
18 for the ITT analysis set . 
Methodology 
and 
treatments  This is a multicenter, double -blind , randomized, parallel -group phase 3 
study in subjects  with T1DM comparing the efficacy, immunogenicity  
and safety of MYL -1501D products from two manufacturing processes 
(Process V and Process VI).  
After u p to 2-week screening period, all subjects  will be titrated on 
Lantus® during a 4- week run-in period, and will be shifted from their 
current mealtime insulin to Humalog®. The subjects will be randomized 
(stratified by [CONTACT_394505] [mo rning and evening]); 
one group will re ceive MYL -1501D product from Process V, while the 
other group will receive MYL -1501D product from Process VI for [ADDRESS_495277] dose of MYL -1501D. 
The study will be conduc
 ted in the US. Approximately 110 sites will be 
included in the study.

and a 90% power, a total of 172 subjects (86 subjects per treatment group) are required. To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects being not eligible for the per protocol analysis, a total sampl e size of [ADDRESS_495290] deviation is based on previous study MYL- GAIA -3001. 
Statistical 
Methods  A repeated measures analysis employing a restricted maximum likelihood

1501D Process VI product for mean change in HbA1c at Week 18. 
Non- inferiority for primary objective  will be established if the upper limit 
of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference (MYL -1501D Process VI minus MYL -1501D Process V) of mean change 
from baseline for HbA1c is no greater than 0.4% at [ADDRESS_495291] OF COMMONLY USED ABBREVIATIONS .............................................................. 14

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Indication 
MYL -1501D is
 being developed as a follow- on bio logic (US terminology) or biosimilar (EU 
terminology) to  Lantus®.  
2.[ADDRESS_495303]-prandial surge. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by 
[CONTACT_394510]-producing beta- cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to 
a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of beta -cell loss is a T -cell mediated autoimmune 
attack [1]. The principal treatment of patients with T1DM is initiation of insulin and diet 
control a
nd careful monitoring of blood glucose levels. 
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [2] and other trials [ 3] provide c onclusive 
evidence
 that maintaining tight glycemic control can prevent or delay microvascular and 
macrovascular complications in patients with T1DM. A number of different insulin regimens 
have been proposed for treatment of patients with T1DM. It is generally accepted that the so-called basal -bolus insulin regimen (1 or 2 daily injections of long/intermediate- acting insulin 
covering basal insulin requirements in combination with 3 daily injections of short-/rapid acting insulin to cover meal- related insulin requiremen ts) generally yields the best glycemic 
control in diabetes. Clear targets for plasma glucose levels have been recommended for basal -
bolus insulin regimens [ 4]. 
Different insulin preparations are available for management of basal insulin requirements, including
 intermediate -acting insulins (neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin) and long- acting 
insulin analogs such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Long- acting  insulin analogs have 
proven efficacy and offer good glucose control over 24 hours for a single dose. Insulin glargine is a long -acting insulin analogue allowing once- daily administration to cover basal 
insulin requirements for over 24 hours. After injection of Insulin glargine into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralized; leading to formation of micro-precipi[INVESTIGATOR_394473], providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration versus time profile with a prolonged duration of action.  
MYL -1501D is a human insulin analogue of r-DNA origin produced in the host organism  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_394474]. P pastoris  is a methylotropic yeast that has been successfully used in the 
production of proteins.  The aim of this study i
 s to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety between MYL -1501D 
product produced from two manufacturing processes in combination with insulin lispro in 
patients with T1DM . 
Since the two  investig ational products have an identical presentation of prefilled pen to be 
used by [CONTACT_423] s during the treatment period, the subject  and the treating physician will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment. Furthermore, the evaluation of the study endpoints, 
such as  analysis of immunogenicity and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) , will be 
performed  in a blinded manner by  [CONTACT_229191]. The sponsor team as well as the CRO 
team will also be blinded to the subject assigned  treatment . 
Mylan 
MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495304] been on a stable dose of 
Lantus® for at least 3 months prior to screening will be included.  
During the 4- week  ru n-in period with Lantus® and Humalog®, the dose of insulin will be 
titrated (if required) to ensure diabetes control. T he run -in period ensures comparable drug 
exposure for all subjects , and increases the likelihood of comparable immune responses at the 
start of the treatment period. An 18- week treatment period is  an adequate period to detect 
differences in HbA1c of the treatment arms  [5]. 
Dosin g with MYL -1501 D during treatment period and Lantus® during run -in period will be 
guided by [CONTACT_6270] -monitored blood glucose ( SMBG )-based glucose level assessments, as 
suggested in the dosing algorithm.  
Rescue criteria based on HbA1c are defined  based  on week [ADDRESS_495305] s 
after they stop the study medication and return to receiving  approved medications. 
Complete information for the study medication  can be f ound in MYL -1501D Investigator’s

Medications taken within 28 days prior to screening and prior to dosing with study 
medication will be documented as a prior medication. Medications taken after dosing with 
study medication will be documented as concomitant medications.  
Other than study drugs, insulin, insulin analogs and other anti- diabet es medications as well as 
glucocorticoid therapy (oral, intravenous, inhaled or other routes that produce systemic 
effect s) are prohibited during the study (including the run-in period and the treatment period ), 
except in case of rescue medication treatment .  
A list of medications that may interfere with the effect of insulin is provided i n Table 2. No

implications before deciding to participate.  Subject s agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening (if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS  
system.  
Once a subject enrol
 ls in this study,  the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the study . Clinical study site staff are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_103853]. Elements of this plan may include the following. 
• Thorough explanation of the complete clinical study  v isit schedule an d procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re- emphasis at each clinic visit.  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the 
st
udy's successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment grou ps to the 
overall success of the study . 
• Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic vis
it attendance and full study participation and compliance.  
• Collection of contact [CONTACT_103901] (address, phone numbe rs , email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits. 
• Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.  
• I
mmediate and multifaceted follow -up on m issed clinic visits, including the possible 
use of trained staff to complete in -person contac t with subjects at their homes.  
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
res
chedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_394525]. All contact [CONTACT_9300]'s medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of "Los t to Follow -up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of site plans to support and retain subjects within the study, subjects may voluntarily withdraw from th e study for any reason and at any time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of stud
y would be up to [ADDRESS_495335] prior to enrolment.  
6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1  [Week -6 to Week -4]) 
Subjects will commence screening pro cedures within [ADDRESS_495336]  will need to be discussed  with Mylan or designee to consider potential for 
re-screening (if re screening is agreed, the subject will need to be re consented and assigned a 
new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re -screening for other reasons may be possible following 
discussion with the Mylan or designee. If re screening occurs this will be clearly documented 
within the site file.  
The following will be completed in dur ing the visit: 
• Obtain written informed consent before any study- r elated procedure is initiated, 
including the cessation of prohibited concomitant therapy. A copy of the signed ICF (including subject information sheet) will be given to the subject  (and IHS -810 form

 ubject  withdraws or is withdrawn, the 
reason for termination/withdrawal should be established and recorded. If a subject  does not 
return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_423] . In any 
circumstance, every effort should be made to document the outcome of subject contact [CONTACT_103904], if possible. The investigator will contact [CONTACT_394529] , if subject  fails to 
complete the study or violates the protocol.  
If the subject  w
 ithdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The spons or may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. 
Unless consent is withdrawn, subject s w
 ho prematurely terminate study drug will be asked to 
return to the clinic  to conduct the ET visit as soon as possible after their last dose of study 
drug, and in case consent subject will be asked to conduct all the remaining visits according 
to study schedule table until the end of the study.  
At the ET visit the  E nd of Treatment visit (Week 18/ Visit 14), pro cedures should be

6.5.2 Safety Testing  Assessments 
Safety will  be a ssessed through physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, 12- lead

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Assessment  
If
 a subject  reports any symptoms after the signing of the informed consent form, they will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_394530]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_394478]- Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the 
course of action. 
Clinically relevant f indi
 ngs from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical 
examinations will be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant changes from the 
screening procedures results  will be recorded as adverse events.  
Subjects will be routinely queried with re gard to the presence or absence of adverse events 
using open ended questions. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events in 
the subject’s CRF.  The adverse event source documentation will minimally include the 
following information: date and time of as sessment, the outcome of the response, and 
identification of the clinic staff member collecting the information.

A. Severe Hypoglycemia  
A

neurological recovery, regardless of the availability of a blood glucose measurement. These 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982]. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose is considered suffic ient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.    
B. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_394480] a measured

E. Relative Hypoglycemia.  
A
n event during which the subject  re ports any of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and 
interprets the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose 
concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). F. Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia include but are not limited to the following: palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
sweating, hunger, nervousness and shakiness, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], dizziness or light–headedness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], confusion, difficulty speaking, feeling anxious or weak. Neuroglycopenic manif estations may include seizure, coma, and even death.  
Subject  will be instructed to be alert for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; and if possible 
to t
ake glucose meter readings at the time of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_394483] (if it was checked) in their diary.  
Investigators will instruct the sub
 jects on self- management of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Investigators will also instruct subject s on remedial actions to be taken during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_113424]. Subject  will be encouraged to call the study site if they experience 
hypoglycemia.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Manage ment of Hypoglycemia 
The following steps are recommended for managing hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]:  
1. The subject  shoul d begin with 15 to 20 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 3-4 teaspoons of 
table sugar dissolved in water, 1 tablespoon of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 3-4 
glucose tablets).  
2. Subsequently, if the glucose level is ≤50 mg/dL, then the subject  wil l be asked to 
consume 20 to 30 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 4-6 teaspoons of table sugar dissolved in water, 2 tablespoons of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 4-5 glucose tablets).  
3. Subject  wi
 ll be asked to recheck blood glucose after [ADDRESS_495362]  can be
  treated with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) 
given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate training, 
or glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Intravenous glucose can also be given if the subject  does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended in order to prevent a relapse.  
Full hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_394484], duration, time of recov

characterization. Samples collected pre-dose at the  randomization visit (Visit 6) will be 
considered as baseli ne. S amples collected at screening  and the supplemental samples 
collected at baseline may  also be used for method development and validation. Sample  
handling instructions are specified in the laboratory manual. 
A conventional radioimmunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_394489] (RIPA) will be employed for the assessment 
of anti-drug anti
bodies in clinical samples. In this assay, s amples will undergo a pre-
treatment step th at includes acid dissociation to release any anti -insulin antibodies complexed 
with free drug, followed by [CONTACT_394533]. The treated samples will be incubated with a fixed amount of 
125I-MYL -1501D, and anti -drug antibody  
complex formation with the tracer is measured via gamma counter and expressed as a 
percentage of bound to total radioactivity (%B/T).  
The multi- tiered sample analysis recommendations for immunogenicity testing from 
published white papers [ 7, 8], and current regulatory guidance [ 9, 10] , will be e mployed for 
the immunogenici
ty assessment of MYL-1501D Process V and Process VI. The antidrug 
antibody analysis  methodology will be fully validated, and the sample analysis procedures 
will be documented in a Sample Analysis Protocol.  Sample handling, processing, and storage 
instructions will be detailed in a separate manual.  The laboratory for immunogenicity 
analysis will be designated by [CONTACT_1034].

7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
wi
ll be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained 
by [CONTACT_456]. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected  in a protocol amendment. 
7.[ADDRESS_495367] , in a 1:[ADDRESS_495368] deviation is equal to 0.74. To 
demonstrate non- inferiorit y margin of 0.4% using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval and a 
90% power, a total of 172 subjects  (86 subjects  per treatment group) are required .  
To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects  bei ng not eligible for the per protocol analysis, 
a total sample size of [ADDRESS_495369] s will be taken account – irrespectively of 
their missing value pattern, which are expected to be limited to less than 5% of the subjects . 
Then the treatment effect will be estimated using a  repeated measures analysis employing a 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based, mixed  model repeated measures (MMRM) -
effects model approach . In this model all subject s will be used for the estimation of the 95% 
confidence interval of the difference between MYL -1501D Process VI product and Process V 
product for mean change in HbA1c at week 18. The MMRM model will include the fixed, 
categorical effect of treatment group assignment, visit, treatment group -by-visit interaction 
and the other fixed effect terms investigator , basal in sulin dose time, and baseline HbA1c 
value as covariates.  
Further details on the MMRM model will be provided in the SAP. In vestigator pooling will 
be finalized before unblinding treatment to avoid introducing bias. The detailed method of investigator pooling will be documented in the SAP.

7.2.3 Primary Analysis for Primary Endpoints 
For primary endpoint analysis, non- in feriority for efficacy will be establish ed if the upper 
limit of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference ( MYL -1501D 
Process  VI minus Process V) of mean change from baseline to endpoint for HbA1c is no 
greater than 0.4% at Week 18. The primary analysis will be performed on the intent to treat 
(ITT) analysis set .  
7.2.4 Secondary/Sensitivity Analyses for Primary Endpoints 
A
 further ro bust ness check will be conducted using the PP population and applying the same 
MMRM procedure as described in previous section to establish non- inferiority. Any 
differences in the conclusion will be further investigated by [CONTACT_394535]. 
Other sensitivity analysis addressing missing data will be c onducted in the following manner:  
Multiple imputed datasets will be generated based on the assumption of a monotone missing 
da
ta pattern. The imputation will be perfo rmed using the monotone regression method for 
week 12 and week 18 sequentially. The variables treatment, pooled investigator, and basal insulin dose time  will be used as independent. 
In a second step, the imputed values will be corrected such that the full non- inf
 eriority margin 
will be added for imputed values in Process VI group. All imputed datasets will be analyzed using the same model parameters as used in the primary analysis, and the results will be combined using Rubin’s rules. 
A standard last obse
 rvation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be conducted such that 
missing data will be imputed by [CONTACT_317875]. This dataset will be analyzed for the ITT and PP 
populations using the ANCOVA model described in the protocol. 
7.2.5 Missing Data 
T
he only imputed data will be performed in the s e nsitivity analysis as described above for 
HbA1c . Otherwise, missing data will not be imputed.  
7.2.6 Sub- Group Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of important factors, including but not limited to factors such as age 
gr
oup, gender and race are planned for the key outcomes of HbA1c and immunogenicity 
variables. These will be conducted by [CONTACT_394536]- by-factor interactions to 
the MMRM model models of the main analyses. Other exploratory subgroup analyses may be performed, as deemed  appropriate.  
7.3 Secondary Endpoints  
T
he following efficacy measures (both actual and change values) will be summarized at 
ba
seline and scheduled visit. Similar statistical analysis approach for primary will be 
performed for continuous variables. Contrasts of LS mean at each scheduled visit will be 
used to evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, and 95% confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means will be computed for each visit.

• Change in 8-point SMBG profile from baseline .  
All above analyses will be performed on ITT set.  
The following safety measures (both actual and change values) will be summa ri zed at 
baseline and scheduled visit. Contrasts of LS mean at each scheduled visit will be used to 
evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, and 95% confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means will be computed for each visit. For categor ical data analyses, 
Fisher’s exact test  or Chi- squared test  will be used . The details will be provided in the SAP.

(SAEs) 
• Incidence of local allergic r eactions, systemic allergic  reactions and other adverse 
events  
• Incidence of device-r el ated safety assessment  
 
The incidence of subjects with each of the three following criteria will be summarized 
descriptively (for categorical measures) by [CONTACT_394537]: 
• An i
ncrease of over 10% in cross reacting antibodies  from  baseline  
• Increases in Hb A1c of over 0.2% from  baseline at any visit  
• Increase in total or basal in sulin dose at any visit  
 
The total incidence of Dev ice-related safety events will be summarized for each treatment 
group and would include device- related TEAEs and events related to device complaints or 
failures. For device- related TEAEs, two categories will be summarized for each treatment: 
needle-related TEAEs such as pain, bruise, and bleeding; and other device- related TEAEs, 
such as  hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. For confirmed device-related malfunctions or 
failures, incidence will be listed and summarized for each treatment.  
All above analyses will be performed on safety set.

The investigator shall provide a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the subject, and a signed and dated copy shall be maintained in the volunteer’s medical record. 
8.[ADDRESS_495378](s) will be reported as outlined in this section.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of
 all AEs and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causality and should obtain sufficient information to determine the causality of all AE s. All AEs  will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted with the sponsor concurring with that assessment.  
9.[ADDRESS_495379]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product. 
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre-existing diseases or conditions. 
o
 Pre-ex i sting diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the 
disease or condition.  
An AE will be defined as a TEAE if the first onset (or worsening, in the case of pre- ex isting 
disease) is after the first administration of MYL -1501D after randomization through follow-
up visit or [ADDRESS_495380] dose [for subjects  that do not have a follow- up visit].  
9.2.[ADDRESS_495381] related to any dose should 
be c
onsidered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “responses to an investigational 
product” means that a causal relationship between an investigational product and an AE is at 
least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by [CONTACT_394540] a reasonable causal relationship to an investigational product will be designated as ADRs.  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the st
 udy drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the AE must be treated as if the relationship were “po ssible.” 
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
A
n unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
th
e applicable reference safety information designated for the study . For example, hepatic

 NOTE: A  congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed 
to the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient that has received the study drug is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the study drug interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The patient with newly diagnosed pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be 
followed-up every 3 months until delivery or termination to gather information 
about the outcome of the pregnancy.

[IP_ADDRESS]
 Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
T
he clinical severity of an AE will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE Criteria Version 4.03. A 
cop
y of these criteria will be provided to each study site. If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, 
its clinical severity will be classified as follows:

MYL -1501D Protocol 18 SEP 2017  Confidential  
Table 5: Clinical Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subje ct's usual function.  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with subject 's us ual function.  
Grade 3 – SEVERE  Interferes significantly with subject 's us ual function.  
Grade 4 - LIFE -THREATENING Risk of death at time of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
 
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria, then the AE meets the criteria for an 
SAE and t
he Investigator should immediately notify the sponsor or designee as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of inten sit 
y based on the CTCAE grading or on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that 
meets any of the regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness described in Section  9.2.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken  
The poss
ible actions taken for an AE are described in Table 6. 
Table 6: Action Taken for an Adverse Event  
Dose reduced  The dose regimen was reduced by [CONTACT_394543], strength, or 
amount.  
Dose increased  The dose regimen  was i ncreased by [CONTACT_394543], strength, or 
amount.  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was temporarily interrupted.  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued.  
Concomitant therapy or procedures  Treatment was needed as a result of the AE (the concomitant treatment shoul
d be recorded on the relevant page of the CRF).  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
No action taken  The AE did not require any intervention.  
Not applicable  AE occurred after study m edicat ion was permanently withdrawn or 
subject  completed the treatment period.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recover
ed/resolved with sequelae  
• Recov
ering/resolving  
• Not r
ecovered/not resolved 
• Fatal

All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e. did not cause death) will be recorded as not 
recovered/not resolved at the time of death. 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE is 
poss
ibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
which is the most plausible cause of death in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  
Note:  although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or 
une
xplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
A
n Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
re
asonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF. In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE or SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the
 Investigator must record this information about the causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in accordanc e with the 
reporting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE. 
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset) 
•
 Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s)  
•
 Pharmacological plausibility  
•
 Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history) 
•
 Drug Interactions  
•
 De-challenge/re- ch allenge 
• Dose relationship 
 A
 suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
med
ication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment in accordance with the following definitions: 
Table 7: D
efinition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY  Causal relationship is certain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degree of certainty for ca
usal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de-
challenge (re -challenge  is not required), and other 
Mylan 
MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495386] been eliminated or are unlikely.  
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncer
tain For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable 
or unknown, de -challenge information is either 
unknown or equivocal, and while other potential 
causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to study drug does not appear probable  
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y rel ated 
although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out  For Example: Event or labor ator
 y test abnormality, 
with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations  
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATED  No possible relationship  The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible  
 
For SAEs,  the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
rel
ated/unrelated, an alternative suspected et iology should preferably be provided (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent condition) wherever applicable and available. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation 
Al
l AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF
 with the following information; where appropriate (the period of observation for the 
study is described in Section  6): 
• AE name [CONTACT_394560].  
• W
hen the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the date 
th
e AE became serious.  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoi
ng, i.e., recovering or not recovered). 
• Severity of the AE.  
• S

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Adverse Events  
AE
s that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by [CONTACT_214717]. 
If 
such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason should be documented 
in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject may resume the study treatment will be made by [CONTACT_394544]/or medical monitor.

[IP_ADDRESS] Follow- up 
Any AE will be followed -up t o a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can 
be explained by [CONTACT_17648] (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates tha t further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Notification 
F
or SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from t he  time that the subject  provides 
informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, i.e., prior 
to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including the follow up visit. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE occurring any time after the active reporting period, the SAE must be promptly reported to Mylan only in case of reasonable causality (i.e. suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  i
 s to be completed for al l serious adverse events, signed by [CONTACT_3786], and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory reports). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name [CONTACT_394561]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7965]) must not be visible on SAE forms or any supporting documentation provided by [CONTACT_737]. These should be “blacked out”, and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification, the Investigator/designe e s hould provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number 
•
 Reporter ( s tudy site and Investigator) 
• Subject’s uni que identification number  
• Subject ’s  age 
• Investigational medicinal product

regulations (including local law and guidance) regarding notification to her/his regulatory 
authorities, ethics committees (ECs) and institutions.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), SAEs and other cases required by [CONTACT_394547]’s

Pregnancy testing will be conducted throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of 
assessments. A woman who is found to be pregnan t at the randomization visit (Visit 6 [Week 
0]), will be excluded from the study. A woman who becomes pregnant during the study will 
be immediately discontinued from study treatment. Early discontinuation visit assessments 
should be performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. This information should be captured in the pregnancy form and reported to Mylan Product Safety and Risk Management within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clinical database.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or el
ective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
cons
idered to be an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that the 
outcome (e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours and sent as a follow-up on the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form).  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly intervals 
unti
l delivery or termination, informing the sponsor about its outcome.   
9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and Other Events  
O
verdose per se  o f either study treatment or a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Signs, symptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be recorded on the AE CRF page. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as protocol deviations. 
9.[ADDRESS_495391] Findings  
A
bnormal laboratory findings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
asse
ssments (e.g., ECG, X -rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with signs and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an SAE if they 
meet th e criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal findings that are detected after study drug administration or that are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug are included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abnormal objective tes t finding 
should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
•
 The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a
nd/or 
• The test result leads to a change in s tudy dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or 
• The test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_394548].

Version 2.0  
11 JAN 2018 • Titration committee added to guide the dosing of MYL -1501D 
during treatment period and Lantus® during run-in period 
(Section 2.2) 
• Added option of being on stable dose for Levemir® or Toujeo® 
for at least 3 months at screening (Previously only Lantus was 
allowed as the only treatment option) (Section 4.2.1) 
• Updated the Email ID for reporting medication/device related 
c
omplaints from 
[EMAIL_7555] to [EMAIL_7557] (Section 5.2) 
• ECGs: Updated the requirement for being in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] 
f
rom 10 mins to 5 mins prior to an ECG. (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Review of results of the 8-point SMBG measurements removed 
f
rom Visit 7 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 2), Visit 9 (Week 4) and  
Visit 11 (Week 9) (Section 6.3) 
• Removed fasting Plasma glucose assessment at Visit 13 (Week 15)
 (Section 6.3) 
• Primary analysis to include all available outcome data from all  
r
andomized patients regardless of treatment discontinuation and 
use multiple imputation approach for missing data that more 
appropriately takes treatment adherence into account. (Section 7.2.2, Section 7.2.4 and Section 7.3) 
• Primary efficacy popul
 ation (ITT) to include all randomized

MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495396] Lantus® (insulin glargine) . A phase 1 PK/PD study comparing 
MYL -1501D with Lantus® sourced from Europe and U.S. demonstrated 
PK and PD equivalence between the 3 products. PK/PD equivalenc e was 
also demonstrated with MYL-1501D product produced using two 
manufacturing processes (Process V and Process VI).  
 
The aim of this study is to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety 
between M YL-1501D products produced from two manufacturing 
processes  (Process V and Process VI)  in combination with insulin lispro 
in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) . 
Primary 
Objectives To test whether M YL-1501D product from  Process VI once daily is 
non-inferior to MYL -1501D product from Process V once daily based on 
change in HbA1c from baseline to week 18  when administered in 
combination with mealtime insulin lispro.  
Primary 
endpoints  The primary efficacy endpoint is change in HbA1c from baseline to week 
18 for the ITT analysis set . 
Methodology 
and 
treatments  This is a multicenter, double -blind , randomized, parallel -group phase 3 
study in subjects  with T1DM comparing the efficacy, immunogenicity  
and safety of MYL -1501D products from two manufacturing processes 
(Process V and Process VI).  
After up to 2-week screening period, all subjects  will be titrated on 
Lantus® during a 4- week run-in period, and will be shifted from their 
current mealtime insulin to insulin lispro ( Humalog®). The subjects  will 
be randomized (stratified by [CONTACT_394505] [morning and evening]); one group will re ceive MYL -1501D product from Process

approach will be used to estimate  a 95% confidence interval for the 
absolute difference between MYL -1501D Process V product and MYL-
1501D Process VI product for mean change in HbA1c at Week 18. 
Non- inferiority for primary objective  will be established if the upper limit 
of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference (MYL -1501D Process VI minus MYL -1501D Process V)  of mean change 
from baseline for HbA1c is no greater than 0.4% at [ADDRESS_495411] OF COMMONLY USED ABBREVIATIONS .............................................................. 15

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Indication 
MYL -1501D is being
 developed as a follow- on biologic (US terminology) or biosimilar (EU 
terminology ) to Lantus®.  
2.[ADDRESS_495423]-prandial surge. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by 
[CONTACT_394510]-producing beta- cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to 
a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of beta -cell loss is a T -cell mediated autoimmune 
attack [1]. The principal treatment of patients with T1DM is initiation of insulin and diet 
control and care
ful monitoring of blood glucose levels. 
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [2] and other trials [ 3] provide conclusi ve 
evidence th
at maintaining tight glycemic control can prevent or delay microvascular and 
macrovascular complications in patients with T1DM. A number of different insulin regimens 
have been proposed for treatment of patients with T1DM. It is generally accepted that the so-called basal -bolus insulin regimen (1 or 2 daily injections of long/intermediate- acting insulin 
covering basal insulin requirements in combination with 3 daily injections of short-/rapid acting insulin to cover meal- related insulin requirements) generally yields the best glycemic 
control in diabetes. Clear targets for plasma glucose levels have been recommended for basal -
bolus insulin regimens [ 4]. 
Different insulin preparations are available for management of basal insulin requirements, including inter
mediate -acting insulins (neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin) and long- acting 
insulin analogs such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Long-acting insulin analogs have proven efficacy and offer good glucose control over 24 hours for a single dose. Insulin glargine is a long -acting insulin analogue allowing once- daily administration to cover basal 
insulin requirements for over 24 hours. After injection of Insulin glargine into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralized; leading to formation of micro-precipi[INVESTIGATOR_394473], providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration versus time profile with a prolonged duration of action.  
MYL -1501D is a human insulin analogue of r-DNA origin produced in the host organism  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_349539] . 
P pastoris  is a methylotropic yeast that has been successfully used in the 
production of proteins.  The aim of this study is to
  demonstrate similar efficacy and safety between MYL -1501D 
product produced from two manufacturing processes in combination with insulin lispro in 
patients with T1DM . 
Since the two  investigationa l products have an identical presentation of prefilled  pen to be 
used by [CONTACT_423] s during the treatment period, the subject  and the treating physician will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment. Furthermore, the evaluation of the study endpoints, 
such as  analysis of immunogenicity and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) , will be 
performed  in a blinded manner by  [CONTACT_229191]. The sponsor team as well as the CRO 
team will also be blinded to the subject assigned  treatment . 
Mylan 
MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495424] been on a stable dose of 
Lantus® for at least 3 months prior to screening will be included.  
During the 4- week  run-i n period with Lantus® and Humalog®, the dose of insulin will be 
titrated (if required) to ensure diabetes control. T he run -in period ensures comparable drug 
exposure for all subjects , and increases the likelihood of comparable immune responses at the 
start of the treatment period. An 18- week treatment period is  an adequate period to detect 
differences in HbA1c of the treatment arms  [5]. 
Dosin g with MYL -1501D dur ing treatment period and Lantus® during run -in period will be 
guided by [CONTACT_6270] -monitored blood glucose ( SMBG )-based glucose level assessments  and by [CONTACT_394550] ( titration committee ) plan. 
Rescue criteria based on HbA1c are defined  based on we ek [ADDRESS_495425] s 
after they stop the study medication and return to receiving  approved medications.

the study: 
“Worsening of HbA1c by >1.0% compared to baseline at [ADDRESS_495452] randomization”. 
If the subject  meets  the criterion the investigator can switch the subject  to Lantus® provided 
as part of the study at week 15 (V isit 13) or earlier , and continue with the study activities and 
procedures until the end of the study. 
Mylan 
MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495453] the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
exp
lained to them by [CONTACT_093].  They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate.  Subject s agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening 
(if requ ired) procedures.  A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS  
system.  
Once a subject enroll s in this study,  the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the study . Clinical study site staff are resp onsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_103853]. Elements of this plan may include the following. 
• Thorough explanation of the complete clinical study  visi t schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re- emphasis at each clinic visit.  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the 
stud
y's successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment groups to the 
overall success of the study . 
• Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic visit 
attendance and full study participation and compliance.  
• Collection of contact [CONTACT_103901] (address, phone numbers, email), whic
h is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits. 
• Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.  
• Imme
diate and multifaceted follow -up on mi ssed clinic visits, including the possible 
use of trained staff to complete in -person contact [CONTACT_394553]. 
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
resc
hedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_394525]. All c ontact attempts 
should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of site plans to support and retain subjects within the study, subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason and at an y time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of study
 would be up to [ADDRESS_495454] prior to enrolment.  
6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1  [Week -6 to Week -4]) 
Subjects will commence screening pro cedures within [ADDRESS_495455]  will need to be discussed with Mylan or designee to consider potential for 
re-screening (if re screening is agreed, the subject will need to be re consented and assigned a 
new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re -screening for other reasons may be possible following 
discussion with the Mylan or designee. If re screening occurs this will be clearly documented 
within the site file.  
The following will be completed in dur ing the visit: 
• Obtain written informed consent before any study- r elated procedure is initiated, 
including the cessation of prohibited concomitant therapy.  A copy of the signed ICF 
(including subject information sheet) will be given to the subject  (and IHS -810 form 
for subjects  recruited from US).

Su
bject s may request termination of study drug or withdrawal from the study at any time, or 
be r
equired to withdraw or terminate study drug by [CONTACT_103903]  4.3.4. If study drug is terminated or the su bject  withdraws or is withdrawn, the 
reason for termination/w ithdrawal should be established and recorded. If a subject  does not 
return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_423] . In any 
circumstance, every effort should be made to document the outcome of subject contact 
[CONTACT_103904], if possible.  The investigator will contact [CONTACT_394529] , if subject  fails to 
complete the study or violates the protocol.  
If the subject  wi thdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. 
Unless consent is withdrawn, subject s who pr
 ematurely terminate study drug will be asked to 
return to  the clinic  to conduct the ET visit as soon as possible after their last dose of study 
drug, and in case consent subject will be asked to conduct all the remaining visits according 
to study schedule table until the end of the study.  
At the ET visit the  End of  Treatment visit (Week 18/ Visit 14), pro cedures should be

6.5.2 Safety Testing  Assessments 
Safety will be assessed through physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, 12- le ad 
electrocardiograms, laboratory analyses, and adverse event monitoring. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Assessment  
If
 a subject  reports any symptoms after the signing of the informed consent form , they will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_394530]. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_394478]-Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the course of action. 
Clinically relevant f indi
 ngs from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical 
examinations will be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant changes from the 
screening procedures results  will be recorded as adverse events.  
Subjects will be routinely queried with re gard to the presence or absence of adverse events 
using open ended questions. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events in 
the subject’s CRF.  The adverse event source documentation will minimally include the 
following information: date and time of assessment, the outcome of the response, and identification of the clinic staff member collecting the information.

same way as overall hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Hypoglycemia is a state produced by a lower than normal level of glucose in the blood. This ma

• The subject misses or delays meals or there is a change in diet  
•
 The subject  t akes a higher dose of study drug than prescribed  
• The subject  consumes alcohol  
• The subject  doe s more intense or longer physical exercise or work than normal,

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Classification  
A. Severe Hypoglycemia  
A
n event is considered as severe hypoglycemia if it requires the assistance of another person 
to a
ctively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions which results in 
neurological recovery, regardless of the availability of a blood glucose measurement. These 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982]. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurologi cal 
recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  
B. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_394499] a measured 
plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
C. Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_10922] a measured 
pla
sma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
D. Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia.  
C
haracteristic symptoms of hypoglycemia with no blood glucose level measurement that 
re
solved with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose. 
E. Relative Hypoglycemia.  
A
n event during which the subje ct re ports any of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and 
interprets the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose 
concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
F. Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.  
N
octurnal hypoglycemia will include hypoglycemia that occurs from the time the su bject  
goes to bed at night till the time he or she wakes up. This may include any of the above 5 
types of hypoglycemia.  
Note: A diagnosis of severe hypoglycemia as per above classification will always be 
con
sidered as serious adverse event. Other hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_394481] (life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394482].) or represent important medical events 
based on investigator’s judgment should also be reported to sponsor within 24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Identification of Hypoglycemia 
S
ymptoms of hypoglycemia include but are not limited to the following: palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
sw
eating, hunger, nervousness and shakiness, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], dizziness or light–headedness, 
Mylan 
MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495480]  will be instructed to be alert for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; and if possible 
to 
take glucose meter readings at the time of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_394483] (if it was checked) in their diary.  
Investigators will instruct the subj
 ects on self- management of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
Investigators will also instruct subject s on remedial actions to be taken during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_113424]. Subject  will be encouraged to call the study site if they experience 
hypoglycemia.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Managem ent of Hypoglycemia 
The following steps are recommended for managing hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]:  
1. The subject  should be gin with 15 to 20 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 3-4 teaspoons of 
table sugar dissolved in water, 1 tablespoon of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 3-4 
glucose tablets).  
2. Subsequently, if the glucose level is ≤50 mg/dL, then the subject  will  be asked to 
consume 20 to 30 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 4-6 teaspoons of table sugar dissolved in water, 2 tablespoons of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 4-5 glucose tablets).  
3. Subject  wil
 l be asked to recheck blood glucose after [ADDRESS_495481]  can be t
 reated with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) 
given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate training, 
or glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Intravenous gl ucose can also be 
given if the subject  does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended in order to prevent a relapse.

that includes acid dissociation to release any anti -insulin antibodies complexed with free 
drug, followed by [CONTACT_394533]. The treated samples will be 
incubated with a fixed amount of 125I-MYL -1501D, and anti -drug antibody  complex 
formation with the tracer is measured via gamma counter and expressed as a percentage of 
bound to total radioactivity (%B/T).  
The multi- tiered sample analysis recommendations for immunogenicity testing from 
published white papers [ 7, 8], and current regulator y guidance  [9, 10] , will be empl oyed for 
the immunogenicity assess
ment of MYL-1501D Process V and Process VI. The antidrug

7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in t his  study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained 
by [CONTACT_456]. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or it s analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment. 
7.[ADDRESS_495485] , in a 1:[ADDRESS_495486] deviation is equal to 0.74. To 
demonstrate non- inferiorit y margin of 0.4% using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval and a 
90% power, a total of 172 subjects  (86 subjects  per treatment group) are required . 
To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects  bei ng not eligible for the per protocol analysis, 
a total sample size of [ADDRESS_495487] s will be taken account – 
irrespective of whether subjects having post- baseline measurement . All scheduled 
non-missing data combined together with imputed missing data will be performed for 
primary analysis. Multiple imputed datasets will be generated based on the assumption of a 
monotone missing data pattern. The imputation will be performed using the monotone regression method for week [ADDRESS_495488] will be estimated using a  r
 epeated measures analysis employing a 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based, mixed  model repeated measures (MMRM) -
effects model approach . In this model all subject s will be used for the estimation of the 95% 
confidence interval of the difference between MYL -1501D Process VI product and Process V 
product for mean change in HbA1c at week 18. The MMRM model will include the fixed, 
categorical effect of  treatment group assignment, visit, treatment group- by-visit interaction 
and the other fixed effect terms investigator , basal insulin dose time, and baseline HbA1c 
value as covariates.

Further details on the MMRM model will be provided in the SAP. Investig ator pooling will 
be finalized before unblinding treatment to avoid introducing bias. The detailed method of 
investigator pooling will be documented in the SAP. 
7.2.3 Primary Analysis for Primary Endpoints 
F
or primary endpoint analysis, non- in feriority for effic acy will be establish ed if the upper 
limit of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference ( MYL -1501D 
Process VI minus Process V) of mean change from baseline to endpoint for HbA1c is no 
greater than 0.4% at Week 18. The primary analysis will be performed on the intent to treat 
(ITT) analysis set .  
7.2.4 Secondary/Sensitivity Analyses for Primary Endpoints 
A
 further robustness check will be conducted using the PP population and applying the same 
MM
RM procedure as described in previous section to establish non- inferiority. Any 
differences in the conclusion will be further investigated by [CONTACT_394535]. 
Other sensitivity analysis addressing missing data will be c onducted in the following manner:  
Same analysis approach as primary analysis without imputing missing values.  
In another method, the imputed values will be corrected such that the full non- i nferiority 
margin will be added for imputed values in Process VI group. All imputed datasets will be 
analyzed using the same model parameters as used in the primary analysis, and the results will be combined using Rubin’s rules. 
A standard last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be conducted such that 
miss
ing data will be imputed by [CONTACT_317875]. This dataset will be analyzed for the ITT and PP 
populations using the ANCOVA model for which details will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.5 Missing Data 
T
he only imputed data will be performed in the primary and se nsitivity analys es as described 
above for HbA1c . Otherwise, missing data will not be imputed.  
7.2.6 Sub- Group Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of important factors, including but not limited to factors such as age 
gr
oup, gender and race are planned for the key outcomes of HbA1c and immunogenicity 
variables. These will be conducted by [CONTACT_394536]- by-factor interactions to 
the MMRM model models of the main analyses. Other exploratory subgroup analyses may be performed, as deemed appropriate. 
7.3 Secondary Endpoints  
T
he following efficacy measures (both actual and change values) will be summarized at 
ba
seline and scheduled visit. Similar statistical analysis approach for primary will be 
performed for continuous variables without imputing missing values . Contrasts of LS mean at 
each scheduled visit will be used to evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, and 95% 
confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means will be computed for each visit.

The incidence of subjects with each of the three following criteria will be summarized 
descriptively (for categorical measures) by [CONTACT_394537]: 
• An i
ncrease of over 10% in cross reacting antibodies  from  baseline  
• Increases in Hb A1c of over 0.2% from  baseline at any visit  
• Increase in total or basal in sulin dose at any visit  
 
The total incidence of Dev ice-related safety events will be summarized for each treatment 
group and would include device- related TEAEs  and events related to device complaints or 
failures. For device- related TEAEs, two categories will be summarized for each treatment: 
needle-related TEAEs such as pain, bruise, and bleeding; and other device- related TEAEs, 
such as hyperglycemia or hypoglyc emia. For confirmed device-related malfunctions or 
failures, incidence will be listed and summarized for each treatment.  
All above analyses will be performed on safety set.

8.[ADDRESS_495496] (e.g. IRB or ethics committee) and the Sponsor and/or its agent for review and approval prior to the start of the study. The investigator shall provide a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the subject, and a signed and dated c opy 
shall be maintained in the volunteer’s medical record. 
8.[ADDRESS_495497](s) will be reported as outlined in this section.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of
 all AEs and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causality and should obtain sufficient information to determine the causality of all AE s. All AEs  will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted with the sponsor concurring with that assessment.  
9.[ADDRESS_495498]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product. 
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre-existing diseases or conditions. 
o
 Pre-ex i sting diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the 
disease or condition.  
An AE will be defined as a TEAE if the first onset (or worsening, in the case of pre- ex isting 
disease) is after the first administration of MYL -1501D after randomization through follow-
up visit or [ADDRESS_495499] dose [for subjects  that do not have a follow- up visit].  
9.2.[ADDRESS_495500] related to any dose should 
be c
onsidered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “responses to an investigational 
product” means that a causal relationship between an investigational product and an AE is at 
least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by [CONTACT_394540] a reasonable causal relationship to an investigational product will be designated as ADRs.  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the st
 udy drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the AE must be treated as if the relationship were “po ssible.” 
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
A
n unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
th
e applicable reference safety information designated for the study . For example, hepatic

necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  
The reference safety document  fo

• Results in death. 
•
 Is life -th reatening.  
o NOTE: The term “ lif e-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have ca used death if it were 
more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
•
 Is a congenital anomaly.  
o
 NOTE: A  congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed 
to the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient that has received the study drug is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the study drug interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The patient with newly 
diagnosed pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be 
followed-up every 3 months until delivery or termination to gather information about the outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Is an important medical event.  
o
 NOTE: I mportant Medical Event: Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_394490] / or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o For this protocol, any cancer, including localized basal cell carcinoma, is 
c
onsidered an important medical event, to be reported as a SAE.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].

[IP_ADDRESS]
 Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
T
he clinical severity of an AE will be graded using the NCI- CT CAE Criteria Versi on 4.03. A 
copy of these criteria will be provided to each study site. If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, 
its clinical severity will be classified as follows:

MYL -1501D Protocol 11 JAN 2018  Confidential  
Table 5: Clinical Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subject ' s usual function.  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with subject 's usua l function.  
Grade 3 – SEVERE  Interferes significantly with subject 's usua l function.  
Grade 4 - LIFE -THREATENING Risk of death at time of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
 
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria, then the AE meets the criteria for an 
SAE and the 
Investigator should immediately notify the sponsor or designee as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensit
y based on the CTCAE grading or on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that 
meets any of the regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness 
described in Section  9.2.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken  
The possi
ble actions taken for an AE are described in Table 6. 
Table 6: Action Taken for an Adverse Event  
Dose reduced  The dose regimen was reduced by [CONTACT_394543], strength, or 
amount.  
Dose increased  The dose regimen  was inc reased by [CONTACT_394543], strength, or 
amount.  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was temporarily interrupted.  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued.  
Concomitant therapy or procedures  Treatment was needed as a result of the AE (the concomitant treatment should
 be recorded on the relevant page of the CRF).  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
No action taken  The AE did not require any intervention.  
Not applicable  AE occurred after study medication was permanently withdrawn or 
subject  com
pleted the treatment period.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recove
red/resolved with sequelae  
•
 Recovering/resolving  
• Not re
covered/not resolved 
• Fatal*  
•

All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e. did not cause death) will be recorded as not 
recovered/not resolved at the time of death. 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE resu lt s in death. If more than one AE is 
possibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
which is the most plausible cause of death in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  Note:  although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or 
une
xplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
A
n Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
re
asonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF. In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE or SAE is associated with st
 udy procedures, 
the Investigator must record this information about the causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in accordance with the reporting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE.  
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset) 
•
 Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s)  
•
 Pharmacological plausibility  
•
 Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history) 
•
 Drug Interactions  
•
 De-challenge/re- ch allenge 
• Dose relationship 
 
A
 suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
med
ication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment in accordance with the following definition s: 
Table 7: D
efinition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY  Causal relationship is certain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degr ee o f certainty for 
causal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de-
challenge (re -challenge is not required), and other 
Mylan 
MYL-1501D-[ADDRESS_495505] been eli minated or are unlikely.  
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncert
ain For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable or unknown, de -
challenge information is either 
unknown or equivocal, and while other pote ntial 
causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to study drug does not appear probable  
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y relat ed 
although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out  For Example: Event or laboratory test abnormality, 
with 
a time to drug intak e that makes a relationship 
improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations  
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATED  No possible relationship  The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and t
he AE onset/course is unreasonable or  
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible  
 
For SAEs,  the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
rel
ated/unrelated, an alternative suspected etiology should preferably be provided (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent condition) wherever applicable and available. [IP_ADDRESS] Documentation 
All
 AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF w
ith the following information; where appropriate (the period of observation for the 
study is described in Section  6): 
• AE name [CONTACT_394560].  
• Wh
en the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the date 
the 
AE became serious.  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoin
g, i.e., recovering or not recovered). 
• Severity of the AE.  
• Se
riousness criteria (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, etc.). 
• Ac
tion taken with stud y medication as a result of AE.  
• Outcome.  
• Inv

Hypo
glycemic events and associated signs/symptoms will only be recorded on the

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Adverse Events  
AEs
 that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by [CONTACT_214717]. 
If suc
h treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason should be documented 
in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject may resume the study treatment will be made by [CONTACT_394557]/or medical monitor.

Any AE wi ll b e followed -up to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can 
be explained by [CONTACT_17648] (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings r elevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Notification 
F
or SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from the time that the subject  provides 
informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, i.e., prior 
to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including the follow up visit. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE occurring any time after the active reporting period, the SAE must be promptly reported to Mylan only in case of reasonable causality (i.e. suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  i
 s to be completed for all serious adverse events, signed by [CONTACT_3786], and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory reports). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name [CONTACT_394561]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7965]) must not be visible on SAE forms or any supporting documentation provided by [CONTACT_737]. These should be “blacked out”, and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification , the  Investigator/designee should provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number 
•
 Reporter ( s tudy site and Investigator) 
• Subject’s uni que identification number  
• Subject ’s  age 
• Investigational medicinal product

Pregnancy testing will be conducted throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of 
assessments. A woman who is found to be pregnant at the randomization visit (Visit 6 [Week 
0]), will be e xcluded from the study. A woman who becomes pregnant during the study will 
be immediately discontinued from study treatment. Early discontinuation visit assessments 
should be performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. This information should be captured in the pregnancy form and reported to Mylan Product Safety and Risk Management within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clinical database.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or el
ective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
cons
idered to be an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that the 
outcome (e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours and sent as a follow -up on 
the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form).  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly intervals 
unti
l delivery or termination, informing the sponsor about its outcome.   
9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and  Other Events  
Overdose per se  o f either study treatment or a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Signs, symptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be recorded on the AE CRF page. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as protocol deviations. 
9.[ADDRESS_495510] Findings  
A
bnormal laboratory findings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
asse
ssments (e.g., ECG, X -rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with signs and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an SAE if they 
meet th e criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal findings that are detected after study drug administration or that are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug are included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abnormal objective tes t finding 
should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
•
 The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a
nd/or 
• The test result leads to a change in s tudy dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or 
• The test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_394548].

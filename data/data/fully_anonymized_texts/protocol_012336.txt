Study Title: The Effects of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_32712] #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Document Title: Protocol Summary Document Date: May 25, [ADDRESS_32077], were not currently receiving voice therapy, did not report a bilateral severe or profound level of hearing loss, had a diagnosis of muscle tension dysphonia, showed acoustic dysphonia (Cepstral/Spectral Index of Dysphonia) that exceeded normative values for the participant’s age and sex, showed one or more patterns of supraglottic activity and presence of normal/complete vocal fold closure patterns during laryngoscopy examination, and showed evidence of speech breathing abnormalities relative to normative values. Prior to scheduling the first visit, general information about the study was provided during a telephone screening to determine basic eligibility status, with a copy of the consent form emailed or mailed to them for review before the first appointment.  Assessments In the initial assessment visit, informed consent was obtained and an initial voice questionnaire was completed. For all participants, speech breathing behavior and voice acoustic recordings were obtained during a variety of speaking tasks that were repeatedly administered to determine performance at baseline, after the training phase, and at long-term follow-up timepoints. The primary testing and training phases took place over an 8-week period that included two pre-training assessment sessions in week 1 (baseline assessments), six training sessions held 1xweek (weeks 2 through 7), and two post-training assessment sessions in week 8. Assessment visits were approximately 2 hours, and training sessions were approximately one hour. Laryngoscopy evaluation was completed in week 1 if not recently performed and with recording obtainable through participant’s consent. In addition to the acoustic and speech breathing measurement described below, questionnaires were completed at each assessment timepoint including the Voice Handicap Index-10 and quantification of self-reported speaking effort on a visual analog scale. Participants were provided compensation for their time spent during all assessment but not training visits. Acoustic recordings were obtained with a digital recording system simultaneously with speech breathing recordings. The Computerized Speech Lab (Pentax Medical) was subsequently used for all analyses of the acoustic data. To record and display respi[INVESTIGATOR_32713], the respi[INVESTIGATOR_32714] (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc) 
was used, which included placement of transducer bands around the rib cage and abdomen to record volume changes associated with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32715]. Procedures for speech breathing calibration and measurement were based on well-established methods used clinically and in research. Participants performed calibration tasks while lung volume was measured with a digital spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], noseclip and mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Subsequent recordings of the change in volume for the rib cage and abdomen during speech productions were measured while the participant read a passage aloud, providing estimated lung volume levels without the use of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]. Participants returned for long-term assessments at [ADDRESS_32078]-training. After all short-term sessions were completed (weeks 1-8), control (sham) condition participants were subsequently offered the experimental condition (described below).  Training Participants with muscle tension dysphonia were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) respi[INVESTIGATOR_32716] (RLVT) and 2) a control training (CT) condition involving a sham training device. For the RLVT condition, after the initial assessment sessions, training session [ADDRESS_32079] condition provided respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-like “training” that was not expected to improve speech breathing, and has been used as a control (sham) respi[INVESTIGATOR_32717]. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_32718] (EMST) is among the most frequently studied respi[INVESTIGATOR_32719]. A commercially available device (EMST 150; 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_32720]) was purchased in modified form as a sham-EMST device which removed the internal spring device that offers expi[INVESTIGATOR_32721]. Multiple studies involving general respi[INVESTIGATOR_32722] a sham respi[INVESTIGATOR_32723]. In the CT condition, participants performed multiple sets of [ADDRESS_32080] three times a week through the 6-month time period elapsing between training completion and the final long-term follow-up session.

Statistical Methods:  
General Methodology  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the modified intention- to-treat (mITT) population, 
which includes all subjects who are randomized , received at least one dose of study treatment and 
have a baseline and at least one post- baseline RV measurement within the same period . Should a 
subject require a rescue medication use during the approximately [ADDRESS_729561] 1 dose of study medication.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy estimand is defined as the difference between a single dose of GIS and PIS  in 
the mean change of RV from baseline at 6  hours postdose in COPD patients as characterized by [CONTACT_555697]/exclusion criteria, in the hypothetical setting where the subjects were able to stay on 
study and receive their study drug during their treatment periods. 
The change from baseline in RV at [ADDRESS_729562] 
crossover analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA model will include terms for treatment, period and sequence as fixed effects, period baseline as a covariate, and subjects nested within 
sequence as a random effect. The main estimator of the primary estimand is the Least Squares (LS) mean difference in the change from baseline in RV at 6  hours postdose from the primary ANCOVA 
model. LS mean (and 95% Confidence I nterval [CI] ) for each treatment group and LS mean (and 
2-sided 95% CI), and the associated p- value for the difference between the single nebulized dose of 
GIS and PIS  will be displayed.  
In general, for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, missing observations will be treated as missing at rando m (MAR) and no data imputation will be performed. However, sensitivity 
analyses may be conducted if there is significant amount of missing data, including missing not at 
random (MNAR) assumptions. 
Supplementary analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may  be conducted as deemed appropriate 
and details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Other Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
All other efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the mITT population. 
Protocol SUN101 -402, Version 1.00  Lonhala Magnair (Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution) 
 
Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729563] models.  
Standardized change from baseline in RV AUC0 -4h for each treatment per iod will be calculated using 
the trapezoid method from the changes in RV from  the period baseline value within each treatment 
period and dividing by [CONTACT_555698]. Changes in 
RV from period baseline for  each time point (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours postdose) will be calculated as the 
RV values within each treatment minus the period baseline RV for each treatment period. Change in RV from period baseline at time=0 is equal to 0. 
Standardized change from baseline in RV AUC0 -6h, IC AUC0-4h, IC AUC0-6h, FRC AUC0 -4h, 
FRC AUC0-6h, TLC AUC0 -4h, TLC AUC0 -6h, sRaw AUC0 -4h, sRaw AUC0 -6h, Raw AUC0 -4h, 
and Raw AUC0 -6h will be calculated similarly.  
Changes from baseline in IC, FRC, TLC, sRaw, Raw and FEV1 at 6 hou rs postdose will be calculated 
similar to the primary analysis endpoint. All any other postdose lung volume endpoints (RV, IC, FRC, 
TLC, sRaw and Raw ) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours postdose will be derived and analyzed similar to the 
primary endpoint. 
Safety Analyses  
Adverse events ( AEs), serious adverse events ( SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation during the 
randomized treatment period will be summarized by [CONTACT_555699]. 
Any AEs occurring during the screening period will only be listed.  
Exploratory Endpoint Analyses  
Vital sign data collected at clinic visits will be summarized using descriptive statistics. A separate SAP will be created for accelerateIQ System data.  
Multiplicity adjustment  
No multiple comparison procedures will be employed in this study. 
Sample Size: The evaluable sample size for this study was determined by a two -sample t-test (cross -
over ANOVA) using nQuery version 4.0 (nQuery + nTerim version 4.0, Statistical Solutions, Cork, 
Ireland). A sample size of [ADDRESS_729564] 
deviation of 0.4 L, a mean difference of -0.3 L in change from baseline in RV (single dose of GIS compared to PIS ), with a one-sided alpha of 0.025, will give a power 88%. Discontinued subject s will 
not be replaced. At the Sponsor’s discretion, additional subjects may be enrolled in an effort to 
achieve at least 20  completers ; however, no more than 24 subjects will be randomized.

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729587] 2019 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the major component of chronic lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748], which is the fourth leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002] 
(Kochanek  2016). In addition to m ortality COPD also places a large economic burden in the US 
with direct and indirect cost estimated to be about $52 billion ( Guarascio 2013). COPD is 
characterized by [CONTACT_96896][INVESTIGATOR_555668]/or alveolar abnormalities ( GOLD 2019). The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking. 
Lung hyperinflation (LH) which is defined by [CONTACT_555701][INVESTIGATOR_1516] ( Rossi 2015)  is another important aspect of 
COPD that has major clinical consequences ( Langer 2014, Thomas 2013). LH plays a central 
role in the pathophysiology of dyspnea and exercise limitation in COPD and has been shown to be an independent predictor of exacerbations ( Chen 2016, Rossi 2015). It has also been linked to 
impairment of cardiac function by [CONTACT_555702], right-ventricular dysfunction, impaired left-ventricular filling and reduced cardiac output ( Hohfeld 2018, Rabe 2018).  
Long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long- acting beta
2-agonists (LABAs) are 
central to the long -term maintenance treatment of symptoms in COPD (GOLD 2019). Several 
studies have demonstrated the benefits of long-acting bronchodilators delivered via dry powder 
inhalers o n lung deflation (Hohfeld 2018, Fujimoto 2017, Watz 2017, Santus 2015, Beeh  2011). 
Lonhala Magnair is the first approved nebulized LAMA (glycopyrrolate) for the treatment of 
COPD in the US ( Lonhala Magnair product labeling ) which allows the investigation of a 
nebulized LAMA on LH in patients with COPD. 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Glycopyrrolate inhalation solution ( GIS; Lonhala Magn air) is a nebulized long- acting 
antimuscarinic antagonist (LAMA) indicated for the long- term maintenance treatment of airflow 
obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. COPD is characterized by [CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_94806], resulting in air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_555669]. Hyperinflation is the increased volume of air remaining in the lung at the end of spontaneous 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]. Lung hyperinflation is a major contributor to dyspnea in patients with COPD 
(Laveneziana 2012 ). Studies in COPD have shown that long-acting bronchodilators (LABD) 
administered with hand-held devices reduce hyperinflation. It has been hypothesized that distal 
penetration of LABD administered by [CONTACT_555703] a positive impact on hyperinflation 
irrespective of disease severity ( Loh 2015 ). The Magnair device is a closed system nebulizer 
using the eFlow technology which generates a soft aerosol mist of the drug solution with a 
droplet size distribution and acceptable respi[INVESTIGATOR_555670]. 
This study will provide information on the effects of a single dose of GIS on lung hyperinflation over 6 hours in COPD subjects with hyperinflation. 
Protocol SUN101-402, Version 1.00 Lonhala Magnair (Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution) 
Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729588] 2019 4.3. Risk-Benefit Assessment  
Lonhala Magnair is indicated for the long- term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or 
emphysema. The recommended dose of LONHALA is the inhalation of the contents of one LONHALA vial (25  mcg) twice -daily using MAGNAIR.  
4.4. Hypothesis  
In adults with COPD subjects  as characterized by [CONTACT_190380]/exclusion criteria, after 
2 cross-over periods of treatment, the primary null hypothesis for this study is that the mean 
change of RV from baseline at 6  hours postdose for a single dose of GIS is equal to the mean 
change of RV from baseline at 6  hours postdose for a single dose of placebo inhalation solution 
(PIS). The alternative hypothesis is that these means are different.

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729594] 2019 If needed, subjects will be dispensed albuterol as rescue medic ation at the Screening visit 
(Visit 1). Subjects who are required to switch from taking LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to 
ICS monotherapy will be provided with an ICS. 
 
Visit 2 – Treatment Period 1 (Day 1) 
Subjects will return to the clinical site in th e morning on Day 1. Subjects who continue to meet 
the study eligibility criteria  will be randomized to 1 of 2 crossover treatment sequences with a 
1:1 allocation ratio. A single dose of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_555704] 6:00 – 10:00 AM on Day 1 according to the randomization schedule. In 
order to maintain the blind during study drug administration, an unblinded clinical site staff 
member will perform the randomization and prepare and administer the study drug according to the randomization schedule. The unblinded study personnel will not perform any other study procedures. 
Lung volume measures (plethysmography) will be performed [ADDRESS_729595] a window of ± 15 minutes. Additional 
study procedures identified in Table 2 will be completed at this visit.  
There will be a wash -out period of 7 (+  2) days after dosing on Day 1. 
Visit 3 – Treatment Period 2/End of Study (EOS): (Day 9 [+ 3]) 
Subjects will return to the clinical site in the morning on Day 9 (+  3) for Treatment Period  2. 
Subjects who continue to meet the study eligibility criteria  will have a single dose of study drug 
administered by [CONTACT_555705] 6:00 – 10:00 AM (and within 1 hour of Treatment 
Period 1 dosing time ) according to the treatment sequence assig ned.

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729598] identifier (eg, the second screened subject from site 001 will be 402001002). Subjects 
will be numbered consecutively beginning with 001. No subject numbers are to be reused once assigned. This number will track a subject throughout their participation in the study.  
Subjects who passed study entry criteria and did not get random ized can be rescreened once to 
determine eligibility. Subjects who are rescreened must be assigned a new screening number.  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
The randomization schedule, a sequential list consisting of the randomization numbers and their 
corresponding tr eatment sequence assignment, will be generated by a non- study biostatistician 
according to the process defined by [CONTACT_1034]/contract research organization (CRO)’s standard 
operating procedure (SOP). Once a subject is deemed eligible to be randomized at D ay 1 / Visit 2 and prior to dosing, all 
eligible subjects will be given a randomization number by [CONTACT_555706]. Subjects will be randomized to  one of 
the two following treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio:  
• Treatment sequence A→B (10 subjects) : Single dose  of GIS 25 mcg (Treatment  A) to 
matching PIS (Treatment  B). 
• Treatment sequence B→A (10 subjects) : Matching PIS (Treatment  B) to single dose 
of GIS 25 mcg (Treatment  A). 
Between each treatment sequence, subjects will undergo a washout period before returning to the 
clinic for the corresponding next treatment . 
Randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially in the order the subject become s eligible 
to participate in the study. Once a randomization number is  assigned, it cannot be reused.  
7.2.2. Blinding 
This is a double-blind study. 
During the conduct of the study, in order to maintain the blind during the time of study drug 
administration, up until the analysis is conducted, an unblinded clinical staff member will 
perform the randomization and prepare and administer the study drug according to the randomization schedule. The unblinded study personnel will not perform any other blinded study 
procedures. All study drugs will be dispensed according to the randomization schedule to be 
supplied by [CONTACT_2728]’s representative, using a written study drug dispensing procedure that will assure that subjects remain blinded to the treatment being administered.  
An unblinded clinical staff member will prepare and quality check each dose for each subject as 
instructed in the pharmacy manual according to the randomization schedule and other applicable 
local regulations as set forth in the protocol. 
Subjects, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical operations personnel, 
data analysts, and personnel at the laboratory  will remain bl inded to the identity of the treatment

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729599] 2019 from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, using the following 
method:  randomization data are kept strictly confidential (eg, sealed envelopes kept in a locked 
filing cabinet or placed in a sa fe at the study center and the randomization schedule created by 
[CONTACT_555707] a secure location with restricted access ) until the time 
of unblinding, and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_555708] w ith the 
exception  of the Sponsor’s clinical trials materials manager . 
Details of blinding will be provided in the pharmacy manual. 
7.2.3. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
For emergency unblinding purposes, the Investigator will be provided with a sealed envelope for 
each subject. The cover sheet of the envelope will contain the protocol number and individual subject randomization number. Inside, this envelope will contain information about the 
investigational product given to the subject according to the treatment schedule. The envelope 
may only be opened in the case of emergency when knowledge of the treatment is needed to treat the subject. Date and reason for unblinding are to be documented on the envelope and the case 
report form (CRF ). In the case of unblinding, the Investigator has to withdraw the subject from 
further study participation. These individual subject envelopes should be stored in a secure 
location and returned to the Sponsor/CRO, at the end of study. 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
The study was designed to evaluate the effect of a single dose of Lonhala Magnair on lung hyperinflation, as measured by [CONTACT_290730], as compared with placebo. The crossover desig n allows for 
subjects to serve as their  own control. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The labeled dose for Lonhala Magnair will be utilized in this study. Results of this study will provide information on the effect of a nebulized LAMA on lung hyperinflation following a 
single dose. 
7.3.3. Rationale for the Study Population 
In order to enrich the subjects with hyperinflation, a cutoff value of RV ≥ 130% predicted will be 
selected for this study.  Patients with an RV ≥ 130% predicted are considered to be hyperinflated.  
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
Residual volume was selected because it has been shown to demonstrate the most consistent 
physiological improvement following acute bronchodilator therapy across The Global Initiative 
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages.  
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study prior to s tudy 
completion, the following s tudy design and conduct elements are implemented : eg, (i) use of a 
single study ce nter with an established history of enrolling and following eligible subjects with 
Protocol SUN101-402, Version 1.00 Lonhala Magnair (Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution) 
Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729600] 2019 chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748], (ii) use of a study center with experience in conducting 
plethysmography  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_31757] , (iii) train the study center on the importance of 
continued follow-up and on the informed consent process, ensuring subjects understand the 
commitment they are making, including the intent to complete the trial, and, ( iv) monitor data 
collection via on-site and/or centralized monitoring for adherence during the study, and (vi ) 
rescue medication will be permitted during the study as indicated in Table 6. 
Please see Section 15.3 for statistical considerations  related to missing data.

a Subjects taking LABA/ICS or taking ICS monotherapy need to be on a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_729617] < [ADDRESS_729618] study drug administration. 
Medically acceptable forms of contraception include oral or patch hormonal 
contraceptives, intrauterine device, progestin implant or injection, bilateral tubal ligation, 
or double-barrier (i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a contraceptive sponge). Women using hormonal contraception must use an additional form of contraception. 
2. A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:  
a. Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, 
including any female who is pre-menarchal or post-menopausal); 
− Postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than two years with an appropriate clinical profile. 
− Women who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal should be advised to use contraception as outlined below.  
− Women who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] (as determined by [CONTACT_1130]’s medical history).

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729619] 2019 b. Child-bearing potential (all females ≤ 65 years of age), has a negative pregnancy test 
at screening and agrees to satis fy one of the following requirements: 
− Complete abstinence from intercourse (as part of an abstinent lifestyle) a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_729620] study drug administration,  
− Established use of acceptable methods of contraception a minimum of [ADDRESS_729621] study dru g administration.  
− Acceptable methods of birth control are listed below: 
− Sterilization (vasectomy) of male partner prior to commencement of female 
subject’s last normal menstrual period prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, and the male partner is the sole partner for that female subject; or 
− Implants of levonorgestrel; injectable progesterone; or hormonal contraceptive (combined or progestogen only) (must have been taking reliably through at least one full menstrual cycle period). Subjects using implants, injectable, or hormonal contraceptives must use additional methods of contraception for the duration of the study ; or 
− Documented placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year (not all 
IUDs meet this criterion); or  
− Any other method of contraception with data documented in the product labeling as approved by [CONTACT_17513], or in the absence of approved labeling, in 
peer reviewed studies, showing tha t the highest expected failure rate for that 
method is less than 1% per year. 
Because of the unacceptable failure rate of barrier (chemical and/or physical) methods, the barrier method of contraception must only be used in combination with other acceptable 
methods. Post-coital methods of contraception are not permitted. 
*A female condom and male condom should not be used together due to friction between the 
[ADDRESS_729622] with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must ensure that their partner(s) 
uses the methods of contraception as outlined for female subjects above.  
10.5. Guidance for Overdose  
An overdose of glycopyrrolate may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure (causing 
pain, vision disturbances, or reddening of the eye), obstipation or difficulties in voiding (refer to 
the approved product labeling for Lonhala Magnair ).

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729623] demographics (date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race), height and weight will be recorded in the CRF. 
COPD exacerbation history (with and without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be recorded in the CRF. 
Smoking history will be recorded in the CRF. Number of pack years is calculated as (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked. 
Other medical history (relevant/significant medical history and recurrence of any condi tion) will 
also be recorded in the CRF. 
11.2. Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC)  
The mMRC will be used as a screening tool at Visit 1 to determine patient eligibility. The 
modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale ( Mahler 1984), is a five-item 
instrument (part of the Borg scale) to assess a patient’s degree of breathlessness in relation to 
physical activity. Subjects will be required to read a brief description of an activity and then 
select a statement that best describes their experience with dyspnea at Visit  1. The questionnaire 
should be completed before any other assessments are conducted to avoid influencing the responses. 
Subjects must have a score ≥ [ADDRESS_729624]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ)  
Each subject will complete the St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) at the clinic site  
during the screening visit (Visit 1) . The SGRQ is a standardized disease- specific, [ADDRESS_729625] in the 
clinic (Jones 1991).  
11.4. Efficacy Assessments  
11.4.1. Plethysmography 
Lung plethysmography  (also called body plethysmography) will be used to measure absolute 
lung volumes. Changes in pulmonary gas volume are estimated by [CONTACT_555712]. Plethysmography  measurements will be conducted in accordance with 
the current ATS/ERS  2005 guidelines ( Wanger 2005). 
Measurements  obtained during the test include:

11.5. Safety Assessments  
The Investigator or appropriate designee will review results of safety assessments on a regular 
basis. 
11.5.1. Pretreatment Events and Adverse Events  
Pretreatment events will be collected for each subject from signing informed consent at Visit [ADDRESS_729634] dose of study medication (ie, the placebo dose administered via the Magnair 
Nebulizer System at Screening for training purposes). 
Adverse events will be collected for each subject from the time of the placebo dose (for training 
purposes) administered at Visit 1 to Follow-up. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since 
your last visit?”). See Section 12, Safety Reporting.  
Information regarding format and version of coding dictionary is provided in the DMP. 
AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be monitored throughout the study at all visits .  
11.5.2. 12-Lead Electrocardiograms ( ECG) 
All ECGs will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_290601] 5 minutes. ECG assessments will be performed and read locally. ECGs will be 12- lead with 
a 10-second rhythm strip. The screening ECGs should be obtained prior to obtaining blood

11.6. Exploratory Assessments 
11.6.1. AccelerateIQ System  
The accelerateIQ System is a wireless remote patient monitoring system intended for use by 
[CONTACT_555713]. The accelerateIQ System consists of the VitalPatch Biosensor (a 510k- cleared 
disposable patch with integrated biosensors and a wireless transceiver) and the accelerateIQ Platform (a smartphone with a cellular plan and a mobile application for data transmission, 
cloud-based information-technology [IT] infrastructure, physiology analytics modules, and clinician user interface).  
The patch is worn on the torso for up to 5 days and measures and records physiological data including heart rate, ECG, heart rate variability, R-R interval, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], skin temperature, 
activity (including step count), and posture. Data are transmitted wirelessly from the VitalPatch 
Biosensor to the accelerateIQ IT platform for storage and analysis and presentation within the 
clinician user interface. 
11.6.2. Vital Signs  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_555384], respi[INVESTIGATOR_857], pulse rate, and oral temperature

Protocol SUN101-402, Version 1.00 Lonhala Magnair (Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution) 
Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729642] 2019 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the ICF and first drug 
administration (ie, the placebo dose administered via the Magnair Nebulizer System at Screening  
for training purposes ) are pre-treatment events. Those that occur after first administration of 
study drug (ie, the placebo dose administered via the Magnair Nebulizer System at Screening for training purposes) are considered AEs.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre- existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit/EOS visit. 
New signs and symptoms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging disease 
must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may requir e a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Section 12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967]. 
Protocol SUN101-402, Version 1.00 Lonhala Magnair (Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution) 
Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729643]  has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred 
in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be 
recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign (eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg , abdominal pain) as 
the AE. 
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with 
possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values th at persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical 
significance. If the result of any test (or repeat test, if done)  from the samples taken during 
Screening  is indicated as clinically significant and is not covered by [CONTACT_526153] 8.[ADDRESS_729644] will not be allowed into the study. Additional testing during the study 
may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the Follow-Up Visit, this should be recorded as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalised or stabilised.  
All on-site ECG tracings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator must determine 
the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly drug -related or clinically 
relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any abnormal ECGs that 
persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737].

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729645]’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency, seriousness, action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definition s for severity, 
frequency, action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE: 
• Mild - Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other treatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of sub ject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s 
daily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE: 
• Once – an isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken  with the study treatment: 
• Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily.  
• Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped permanently. 
• Not Applicable.  
• Unknown

• Not related  
o  Not related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease.  
• Related 
o Possible - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration,  but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory before assigning a definite causality.

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729656] 2019 15. STATISTICS  
A comprehensive  statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized for this study prior to locking 
the database. The structure and content of the SAP will provide sufficient detail to meet the 
requirements identified by [CONTACT_555716] o n Harmonization (ICH) of 
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use: Guidance on 
Statistical Principles in Clinical Trials to support the use of this study for registration 
applications. A separate SAP will be created for the exploratory accelerateIQ System  data. Any 
deviations from the main SAP after the database lock, should be documented in the changes in 
the planned analyses form and in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
15.1. Sample Size  
The evaluable sample size for this study was determined by a two -sample t-test (cross -over 
ANOVA) using nQuery version  4.0 (nQuery + nTerim version 4.0, Statistical Solutions, Cork, 
Ireland). A sample size of 10 evaluable subjects per treatment sequence (20  subjects in total), 
assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 0.4 L, a mean difference of -0.3 L in change 
from baseline in RV (single dose of GI S compared to PIS), with a one-sided alpha of 0.025, will 
give a power of 88%. Discontinued subjects will not be replaced. At the Sponsor’s discretion, additional subjects may be enrolled in an effort to achieve at least 20  completers.  
15.2. Analysis Populations  
Modified Intention- to-Treat Population: The modified intention- to-treat (mITT) population will 
consist of subjects  who are randomized, receive at least one dose of study treatment , and have a 
baseline and at least one post- baseline RV measurement within the same period . Should a subject 
require rescue medication use during the approximately 6 hours of efficacy endpoint collection, then any efficacy values that occur after the use of the rescue medication will be set to missing.   
Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment group. 
Safety Population: The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and received at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received. 
15.3. Data Analysis 
In general, descriptive summaries will be provided where appropriate for each of the endpoints. Continuous outcomes will  be summarized for the number of subjects, mean, 95% Confidence 
Interval (CI) for the mean, SD, median, quartile 1 (Q1), quartile 3 (Q3), minimum, and 
maximum. For categorical outcomes, the number and percentage of subjects will be presented.  
All statistic al inference analyses will be performed with [ADDRESS_729657] data 
listings. Unscheduled measurements will be included in the listings and will not be inclu ded in 
summary tables, unless specified otherwise.

15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of potentially IPDs. The potentially IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of s tudy 
data, as well as through review of selected data listings. The potentially IPDs to be reviewed include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
• Did not mee t inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Received any disallowed concomitant medication , including rescue medication use 
during the efficacy endpoint collection. 
Individual IPDs will be presented in a data listing . 
15.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Summaries  for demographic characteristics will be presented for overall using the mITT and 
Safety populations. Demographic characteristics include age (in years), age categories (< 65 years, and ≥ 65 years), gender , race, ethnicity, weight, height, body mass index . Baseline 
characteristics (eg, screening plethysmography and spi[INVESTIGATOR_47145], smoking status, COPD 
exacerbation history, mMRC dyspnea scale grades and SGRQ component and total scores) will also be summarized.  
The medical history of each subject wi ll be coded by [CONTACT_12513] (MedDRA) (see the DMP for version number) system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT). The number and percentage of subjects with medical history findings in each SOC and PT will be summarize d by [CONTACT_555717]. 
15.3.5. Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized for the mITT population using descriptive statistics.  
Should a subject require rescue medication during the approximately [ADDRESS_729660] deviation, median, Q1  and Q3, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729661] 2019 [IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy E ndpoint Analysis 
The primary efficacy estimand is defined as the difference between a single dose of GIS and PIS 
in the mean change of RV from baseline at 6  hours postdose in COPD patients as characterized 
by [CONTACT_190380]/exclusion criteria, in the hypothetical setting where the subjects were able to stay on study and receive their study drug during their treatment periods.  
The change from baseline in RV at [ADDRESS_729662] 
crossover analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the mITT population. The ANCOVA model 
will include terms for treatment, period and sequence as fixed effects, period baseline as a 
covariate, and subjects nested within sequence as a random effect. The Kenward and Roger 
correction for the degrees of freedom will be used. No structure (i.e., unstructured) will be 
assumed for the intra- subject correlation. If convergence is not met, other variance covariance 
structures may be utilized. The main estimator of the primary estimand is the Least Squares (LS) mean difference in the change from baseline in RV at 6 hours postdose from the primary 
ANCOVA model. LS mean (and 95% CI) for each  treatment group and LS mean (and 2-sided 
95% CI), and the associated p- value for the difference between  the single dose of GIS and PIS 
will be displayed.  
Graphical displays of the LS Mean (95% CI) and the LS Mean Difference (95% CI) versus PIS for RV will be presented for each postdose time point (1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours postdose) using the mITT population. 
Subject profile plots for the RV efficacy endpoint at baseline and each post- baseline time point 
will be presented by [CONTACT_1130], period and treatment sequence using the mITT  population. Group 
means by [CONTACT_555718]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Sensitivity Analyses 
In general, for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, missing observations will 
be treated as missing at random (MAR) and no data imputation will be performed. However, 
sensitivity analyses ma y be conducted if there is significant amount of missing data, including 
missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Supplementary Analyses  
Supplementary analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may be conducted as deemed 
appropriate and details will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
All other efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the mITT population. 
All other efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ANCOVA model similar to the primary 
efficacy endpoint with appropriate basel ine as a covariate. Additional covariates may be included 
in select models.

Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729663] 2019 Standardized change from baseline in RV AUC0 -4h for each treatment will be calculated using 
the trapezoid method from the changes in RV from the period baseline value within each 
treatment and dividing by [CONTACT_555719]. Changes in 
RV from period baseline for each time point (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours postdose) will be calculated as 
the RV values within each treatment minus the period baselin e RV for each treatment. Change in 
RV from period baseline at time=0 is equal to  0. 
Standardized change from baseline in RV AUC0 -6h, IC AUC0- 4h, IC AUC0-6h, 
FRC AUC0-4h, FRC AUC0-6h, TLC AUC0-4h, TLC AUC0-6h, sRAW AUC0-4h, sRaw 
AUC0-6h, RAW AUC0 -4h, and Raw AUC0 -6h will be calculated similarly.  
Changes from baseline in IC, FRC, TLC, sRaw, Raw and FEV1 at 6 hrs postdose will be 
calculated similar to the primary analysis endpoint. All any other postdose lung volume 
endpoints (RV, IC, FRC, TLC, sRaw and Raw ) at 1, 2, [ADDRESS_729664], period

No multiple comparison procedures will be employed in this study.  
15.3.6. Exploratory Endpoint Analyses 
A separate SAP will be created for the accelerateIQ System data.  
Height and weight are collected only at Screening. They will be summarized in the demographic 
tables and will be listed .  
Summary statistics for actual values and the change from baseline for vital signs collected at the 
clinical visits will be presented by [CONTACT_555721]. Period baseline is defined as the 
last non-missing predose value on each treatment day. All such vital sign data will be listed . 
15.3.7. Safety Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA (see the DMP for version number) . AEs are untoward 
medical occurrences : 
• That occurred on or after the first dose of s tudy medication,  
• With a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of s tudy medication, 
or 
• With both a missing start and stop date. 
AEs during the randomized treatment period starting at Day  1 will be defined as AEs:  
Protocol SUN101-402, Version 1.00 Lonhala Magnair (Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution) 
Confidential and Proprietary [ADDRESS_729665] 2019 • That occurred on or after the first dose of s tudy medication  given during the 
randomized treatment period, 
• With a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of s tudy medication  
given during the randomized treatment period, or  
with both a missing start and stop date. 
The following AEs during the randomized treatment period will be summarized an d presented by 
[CONTACT_555722]: 
• All AEs (including number of events and subject incidence).  
• AEs by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe).  
• AEs by [CONTACT_29978] (related, or not related).  
Additional AE analyses may be conducted as appropriate. 
The following conventions will be followed in summarizing the AEs during the randomized 
treatment period : 
• For subject incidence summaries, each subject will be counted only once within each 
SOC and within each preferred term.  
• An AE that occurs on or after the date/time of the treatment, up through and excluding the date/time of the next treatment, will be assigned to the treatment group associated with the former treatment. An AE that occurs on or after the date/time of 
the last treatment will be assigned to the treatment group associated with the last 
treatment.  
• If the AE start date is missing, then the AE will be assigned to all treatments received 
on or prior to the known AE end date. If both the AE start date and end date are missing, then the AE will be assigned to all treatments the subject received.  
• If a subject reports more than one AE within a preferred term and/or a body system, 
the AE with the highest known severity within each body system and within each preferred term will be included in the summaries by [CONTACT_926].  Any AE with a missing 
severity will be treated as “severe” and counted in the severe category.  
• For summaries by [CONTACT_29979], AEs will be grouped as 
“related” or “not related.” AEs assessed as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” will be grouped as “related.” If a s ubject reports more than one AE within the same 
treatment, SOC and PT, and any are related, it will be summarized as related.  
Summaries of non-serious AEs with a 5% cutoff, SAEs, and AEs leading to study discontinuation may be provided. 
A listing of all AEs, as well as a listing of deaths , SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and a 
listing of pre -treatment untoward medical events will be presented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical lab assessments are collected at Screening for eligibility. Any clinical lab parameter  data 
(hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be provided in a listing only.

Findings from the physical examination will be presented as follows: pre -existing clinically 
significant conditions recorded as medical history will be summarized, and new clinically 
significant conditions recorded as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All medications will be coded using WHO- DD. All medications will be coded to indication -
specific Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and PT according to the WHO -
DD (see the DMP for version number). 
Other than the study drug, any medications that start prior to the randomized treatment period, 
but continue into the randomized treatment period, and those that start during the randomized 
treatment period, will be considered as concomitant. Medications stopped prior to the date/time 
of the first st udy medication during the randomized treatment period will be considered as prior 
medications.  
The number and percentage of subjects using each prior and concomitant medication will be summarized for each treatment by [CONTACT_555723]. Subjects with multip le uses of a 
medication will be counted only once for a given drug class or PT.

15.3.8. Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned. 
15.3.9. Treatment of Missing Data  
Methods to account for missing data will include the following: 
• For the calculation of an AUC, any intermittent missing measurements will be ignored , 
and the trapezoidal rule will simply span the missing time point(s). For AUC0 -6h, the 
6-hour time point will be use d as the end of the interval. If the 6-hour time point is 
missing, then the AUC0-6h calculation will be based on the time interval up to the last 
non-missing time point prior to hour 6. Similar  rules will be applied  for other AUC 
calculations .

1. Requirements for Testing  
ECG equipment and supplies will be provided by [CONTACT_555726]-clinic protocol ECG assessments.  
• All 12-lead ECGs will be recorded in the same manner.  
• The study center  personnel must be adequately trained in performing ECGs on the 
specific ECG equipment used in this protocol. 
• To the extent possible, the same ECG machine and personnel should be used to acquire a subject’s ECGs throughout the period of their participation in the s tudy. 
• ECGs will be recorded with at least one [ADDRESS_729677] Restrictions and Instructions  
• Prior to ECG acquisition, the subject will have rested at least 5  minutes in the s upi[INVESTIGATOR_555695]. 
3. Reporting  
• It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data for changes from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to 
determine subje cts’ eligibility or continuance in the study. Abnormalities require 
comment as NCS (Not Clinically Significant) or CS (Clinically Significant). 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], CS designated events will be reported as adverse events.  
• ECGs will be reviewed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_30005] 
1572 (MD or DO) after each ECG collection. The same Investigator should review all ECG reports for a given subject whenever possible. 
• The ECG tracing will be kept with subject’s source documentation and / or CRF unless it is specified otherwise. The original ECG will be retained at the study center  
and the Sponsor may collect a copy.

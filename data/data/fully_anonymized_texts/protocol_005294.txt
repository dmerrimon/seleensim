1.0       PURPOSE  
1.1 Name [CONTACT_914558][INVESTIGATOR_914540]20-FIRM-LIPO study. 
 1.2 Objectives   
Primary Objective:  
 Evaluate histological tissue re sponse as seen in biopsies. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1285174] participates in 
all required visits, then the subjec t’s participation in this study may last up to [ADDRESS_1285175] approximately  7 months.  
 
1.4 Context of the Proposed Investigation  
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly us ed in surgery, noninvasive treatments and 
aesthetic applications. RF tec hnology is a safe method for no n-ablative (A non-wounding device 
treatment which heats underlying skin) treatment  because energy can be precisely delivered 
through the skin to the dermal tissue be neath without damaging the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  
 Aging skin shows decreased collag en synthesis and altera tion of fiber networks . By [CONTACT_81908] (which is comprised of colla gen, elastic fibers an d ground substance), both 
immediate effects (collagen cont raction) and long-term effect s (wound-healing response with 
neocollagen production) will occur. RF-induced ther mal injury to the dermal tissue will produce a 
microinflammatory response to induce collagen denaturation, contraction, and subsequent 
synthesis as well as elastin and ground substance production.
[ADDRESS_1285176] ivation, fibroplasia and neocollagenesis in the 
different skin layers is based on a complex multivariate mechanism, which depends on the 
temperature distribution and timing.
2 Further investigation of parameter optimization is necessary 
to achieve safe and efficacious results.    
 
2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they have completed their part icipation in the 
CYN20-FIRM-LIPO study. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled at up to 4 study centers. Subjects 
will receive 2 biopsies, 1 biopsy in  the treatment area on the flank and 1 biopsy on the contralateral 
side to serve as a control.

Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in non-ablativ e aesthetic treatm ents and will 
drive demand for innovated products , procedures, and practice design.[ADDRESS_1285177] few years and the nonsurgi cal treatment using this energy 
source offers great promise to our aging population.4 Radiofrequency technology for the treatment 
of abdominal wrinkles needs to be  further investigated to optimi ze treatment parameters for safe 
and effective non-ablative aesthetic treatments.  
 Relevance: Over time, skin structure degrades due to a variet y of internal and external conditions. As enzymes 
break down collagen and elastin, skin loses its su ppleness and becomes loose.  UV exposure, diet, 
and smoking among other behavior s all contribute to the skin becoming lax.  Body wrinkles, 
particularly on the abdomen, are a sign of aging and are also a pr evalent concern with postpartum 
women or subjects who have lost we ight. It is estimated that adult skin loses approximately 1% of 
its dermal collagen content on an annual basis due to increased collagen degradation and decreased 
collagen synthesis.
[ADDRESS_1285178] profiles and modes of administration. 
 Testability: The improvement in the appearance of skin has b een previously linked to a histological evaluation 
of the treatment area and can be used to verify an increase in  collagen after a radiofrequency 
treatment.  [CONTACT_914562] in  2008 published an article titled Tissue Tightening Technologies: 
Fact or Fiction which discusses the link between changes in collagen and improvement in skin 
tightening, including wrinkles.  The collection of biopsies will allow a histological evaluation of 
the treatment area to confirm the device is safely  and effectively affectin g the collagen in the 
dermis.   
 Compatibility: Not applicable – feasibility study.  Predictive power: While this study will observe the effects of the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_914541], results could potentially 
be applied to a variety of body ar eas and other potential applicat ions.  Assuming that there is 
significant improvement, it would be appropriate to expect results in different areas where other 
products and devices have significant results.  
 
2.2 Protocol Study Design

 Sutures may be used to close the incision site. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1285183] Biopsy Instructions 
 Slight redness, initial tenderne ss to the wound site is normal; however, if you experience 
more redness, swelling, pain, pus, or drai nage contact [CONTACT_914547], 
 If the biopsy site begins to bl eed, apply direct pressure for 10-20 minutes. If it continues to 
bleed, call the study site immediately. 
 Keep the wound dry today and remove bandage in [ADDRESS_1285184] off. 
 Avoid hot tubs, pools, and ocean until sutures are removed.  Avoid soaking in water until 
14 days after your biopsy. 
 When showering, wash carefully  and do not scrub or  traumatize the trea ted skin, or allow 
spray of shower to strike the skin directly.  If the skin is treated harshly, this can increase 
the risk of scarring. 
 After showering, lightly pat dry the wound or let it air dry, then  cover the biopsy site with 
an application of Vaseline (o r petroleum jelly) at least 1-[ADDRESS_1285185] formation over the wound.  
 Band-Aids (or any generic Adhe sive Bandages) may be used  for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_649586]/irrita ted.   Whenever possible, keep Band-Aid (or 
generic Adhesive Bandage) off of the area and keep the area moist with Vaseline (or 
petroleum jelly) as previously  described but do not allow drying out and forming a hard 
scab.  
 For any wound discomfort, you may take Tylenol as needed, or use cold compresses for up 
to 20 minutes hourly as needed.  If using ice,  it should be wrapped in a plastic and then a 
cloth to avoid burning your skin and wetting your bandage. 
 Avoid pi[INVESTIGATOR_914543], which incr eases risk of infe ction and scarring. 
o In order for the wound to heal properly a nd not leave bumpy scars,  be careful not to 
overstretch the wound site area.  As a w ound heals, it will be weaker than the 
surrounding skin and can even "pop open" th e sutures (stitches)  if stretched too 
much.  Sport or strenuous exercises that can  pull at the wound s ite are best avoided 
for at least the next 3 days and up to one week. 
 Return for suture removal within [ADDRESS_1285186] be kept dry as they are more likely to separate when wet. Steri-strips will 
usually fall off by [CONTACT_914548]. 
 ONCE SUTURES ARE OUT: To minimize sore formation and to improve the final 
appearance of your skin, it is very important to keep the wound site area covered with the 
Vaseline for the next few days, until there is no more crust forming and the skin has 
completely healed.  
 Temporary discoloration at the wound site is normal and sh ould gradually fade over the 
next few months.  Please protect newly heal ed biopsied area with SPF and avoid sunburn. 
 2.9 Follow Up 
 The subject may be asked to attend a 1 week (7 -10 days) post biopsy foll ow up visit to remove 
the sutures.

2.13 Evaluation Methods 
Skin Biopsies: Biopsies will be obtained to examine the effects on the skin following radiofrequency treatments. 
Sections of skin will be removed using the punch biopsy technique to render a microscopic 
diagnosis. Each specimen will first be preser ved with a fixative and then stained using 
Hemotoxylin & Eosin, Verhoeff and Masson Red/Fast  Green and/or nitroblue tetrazolium chloride 
(NBTC) staining methods. If us ing Hemotoxylin & Eosin, Verhoe ff and Masson Red/Fast Green 
staining, samples will be assessed and evaluated by [CONTACT_649593]. If 
using NBTC staining, samples will be assessed a nd evaluated to differen tiate between the blue-
stained viable cells and the unstained thermally damaged cells. A report will be provided for each 
sample by [CONTACT_914550] t or the Investigator.

Biopsies Complication with biopsies can include pain, redn ess, swelling, infecti on, bleeding, scarring and 
skin texture irregularities. 
 
 Lidocaine 
1% lidocaine (Lidocaine) Injecti on with or without Epi[INVESTIGATOR_914544]. You may also experience 
redness, rash, infection, skin da mage or nerve damage at the site of the injection. You may 
experience temporary loss of sensation and mu scle function at the site of injection. 
 
Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_914545]-type reactions including anaphylactic sy mptoms and life-threat ening or less severe 
asthmatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_538361].  Adverse Events Pertaining to Surgical Marker: Using surgical marker has minimal risks and ma y produce effects on the body such as redness or a 
rash. Markings may remain vi sible for a few days or may be removed with alcohol.  
 
 3.0  RISK MANAGEMENT  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been  invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or simil ar systems and industry experience.  Experience 
with biopsies is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods will be used.  
The value of the compensation to th e clinical investigator for conduc ting the study is not influenced 
by [CONTACT_81906].    All other known risks will be disclo sed to the subject via the inform ed consent process. Since this 
is an elective procedure and the subjects are volun teers, it can be assumed that their signature [CONTACT_914559] r agreement to accept the risks involved. 
 The risks to the subjects who par ticipate in this study are the same as those for most subjects 
undergoing biopsies when enrolled in  a non-ablative radi ofrequency study.  
  4.[ADDRESS_1285192] Operating Procedure (SOP) for monitoring the inves tigative site will be 
followed. The sponsor will train the site following sponsor SOP’s and may be  present at initiation 
of treatment.  The sponsor will al so monitor the site periodically. The Investigator/Institution will 
permit trial-related moni toring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspections by [CONTACT_81911].  The sponsor ma y request intermediate da ta following each visit

Adverse Events (AE) occurring will be capture d and followed until the condition resolves, 
stabilizes, is otherwise e xplained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Subjects will be instructed that 
they may contact [CONTACT_314661] a ny time throughout the c ourse of the study. 
The Investigator and/or designate d study staff will review each even t and assess its relationship to 
the study device (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating rela tionship to the TempSure™ treatments:  
 Not related – The event is clearly related to othe r factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant me dications administered  to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions , or a concomitant medication ad ministered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known re sponse pattern to the i nvestigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows a reasonable tempor al sequence from the tim e of investigational 
product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant me dications administered  to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from the time  of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_914554] t’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant me dications administered  to the subject. 
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational produc t administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventi ons, or concomitant medica tions administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_100025] i nvestigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site.  Each adverse event reported will be graded  on a 3-point severit y. Using the following 
definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discom fort, and not interferi ng with normal everyday 
activities. 

 Moderate – sufficiently discom forting and may interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or pr eventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experi ence that results in any of the

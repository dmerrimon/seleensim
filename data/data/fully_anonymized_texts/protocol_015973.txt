Study Title:   A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel -Arm, Double 
Masked, Vehicle Controlled Phase 3a Study Evaluating the 
Safety and Eff icacy of OTX -TP in the Treatment of Subjects 
with Open -Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension  
Test Article:  Test Article: OTX- TP (sustained release travoprost ) 
Intracanalicular Depot  
Control: PV (Placebo Vehicle) Intracanalicular Depot  
Phase of Clinical S tudy:  3a 
Study Objective:  To evaluate the safety and IOP lowering efficacy  of OTX-TP, a 
sustained release travoprost drug product, placed in the 
canaliculus of the eyelid in the treatment of subjects with open-
angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
Produ ct Description:  The OTX-TP drug product is a dried polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
based, rod- shaped hydrogel intracanalicular depot  designed to be 
placed in the superior or inferior canaliculus . The hydrogel 
swells on contact [CONTACT_261224],  thus 
holding the intracanalicular depot  in place.  Once OTX- TP 
swells to fill the canaliculus, it is contained in the canaliculus until the hydrogel is resorbed. Embedded in the hydrogel intracanalicular depot  are bioabsorbable poly (lactic acid) (PLA) 
microparticles containing encapsulated travoprost. OTX- TP 
contains conjugated fluorescein to serve as a visualization aid for the Investigator through the use of a blue light source and yellow 
filter to confirm product presence. The intracanalicular depot also has an inert PEG tip to aid in insertion. 
The PV used as the study control is the same fluorescein -
conjugated PEG hydrogel intracanalicular depot  with inert PEG 
tip as OTX-TP, except that it does not contain travoprost.  
Travoprost is a synthetic prostaglandin F2α analogue used for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in subjects with open -
angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Travoprost is the active pharmaceutical  ingredient in Travatan
®, Travatan Z® and Izba™ 
(Alcon Laboratories Inc ., Fort Worth, TX) which have been 
approved by [CONTACT_666896] 021257, 021994, and 204822, respectively.   
OTX-TP is an extended release drug delivery depot designed to 
release travoprost over a period of up to 12 weeks .

Intended Use:  OTX-TP (sustained release travoprost) Intracanalicular Depot is 
intended for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in 
subjects with open- angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OH).  
Study Design:  
 This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel -arm, 
double masked, placebo vehicle controlled trial to evaluate the safety and IOP-lowering efficacy of OTX-TP, a sustained 
release drug product placed in the canaliculus of the eye in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  A total of up to 550 subjects ( 1100 eyes) with a clinical diagnosis 
of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in  both eyes will 
be receive either OTX -TP or PV in this trial to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of  the OTX-TP drug product.   
The subjects enrolled in this parallel arm study will be 
randomized to receive either OTX -TP (sustained release 
travoprost) Intracanalicular Depot or PV (placebo vehicle) 
intracanalicular depot, respectively.   Subjects randomized to the 
treatment group will receive OTX-TP in either the superior or 
inferior canaliculus  of each affected eye on Day 1.  Subjects 
randomized to the control group will receive PV in either the 
superior or inferior canaliculus  of each affected eye on Day 1.   
Subject randomization is 3:2 with a total of approximately 330 
subjects in the OTX -TP arm and 220 in the PV arm.

OTX-16-002 Page 11 of 75 
Rev E: May 2, 2017 Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_666897] -hypertensive therapy  with 3 levels: 
Stratum A : Subjects who were on prostaglandin treatment at the 
time of the Screening Visit and have shown an adequate IOP rise 
after a 6-week washout (interval from Screening to Baseline 
Visit 1 is 6 weeks).   This may include subjects exiting from a 
prior ophthalmic investigational research study based on criteria specified in  
Appendix A  . 
Stratum B : Subjects who were treatment -naïve at Screening and 
have shown an adequate prostaglandin response after a 2- week 
run-in period on prostaglandin treatment followed by a 6- week 
washout (interval from Screening to Baseline Visit 1 is 8 weeks). This may include subjects exiting from a prior opht halmic 
investigational research study based on criteria specified in Appendix A  . 
Stratum C : Subjects who have recently exited from a prior 
ophthalmic investigational research study and have written approval from the Medical Monitor to be allowed to participate in the current study without additional exposure to prostaglandin (Refer to Appendix A  ). 
Once it is determined that the subject continues to meet eligibility for  the study at Baseline Visit 2, the subject will be 
randomized into the study corresponding to the subject’ s 
previous ocular anti -hypertensive therapy category and both eyes 
will be provided with the same assigned treatment, OTX- TP or 
PV. 
Both eyes will receive either OTX -TP or PV , but only the eye 
with the higher IOP at 8:00AM at  Baseline Visit [ADDRESS_900252] the same IOP at 8AM on Baseline Visit 2 (Day 
1), the right eye will be the study eye and the left eye will be considered the secondary study eye. All eyes will be included in 
the safety analysis.  
Subjects currently being treated with a prostaglandin analogue at 
the time of the Screening Visit will undergo a 6 week (- 2 days/+ 
3 days) washout period starting at the Screening Visit and prior 
to Baseline Visit 1.  The Baseline Visit 2/Insertion Visit, Day 1 
will be conducted two to four days after the Baseline Visit 1.  
IOP measurements at the baseline visits will confirm that the 
washout period was sufficient.

Rev E: May 2, [ADDRESS_900253] two IOP 
measurements will be taken over a two week period ( Run-in 
Visit 1 at 2 days [+ 3 days] post-initiation of prostaglandin 
therapy; and Run-in Visit 2 at 11 days [ + 3 days] post-initiation 
of prostaglandin therapy). The Run- in IOP measurements will be 
conducted at 8 AM +/ - 1 hour, to confirm the response to 
prostaglandin therapy. Once the response is confirmed, the subjects will undergo a 6 week (- 2 days/+ 3 days ) washout 
period prior to Baseline Visit 1 . The Baseline Visit 2/Inse rtion

captured on the appropriate eCRF. Timing and requirements for the period between Screening and Baseline Visit 1 will vary, please refer to  Appendix A   for additional specificatio ns.  
At Baseline Visit 2/Insertion V isit (Day 1) , if insertion is 
unsuccessful in one eye, the intracanalicular depot  from the 
contralateral eye (if already inserted) will not be removed. The 
subject will be prescribed IOP-lowering drops at the Investigato r’s discretion for the eye that did not receive a depot.  
These subjects will be followed for safety only, and the eye that 
received a depot will be included in the safety analysis. The 
study will be supplemented with additional subjects to account for these subjects in order to ensure that the necessary number of  
subjects who receive a depot bilaterally are followed through the

For subjects with Early Loss of Intracanalicular Depot Prior to 
the 6 Week  Visit: 
At any visit prior to the 6 Week Visit, if the intracanalicular 
depot is not visualized  in one or both eyes by [CONTACT_737], 
the Investigator will insert a new intracanalicular depot  in the 
respective eye(s) after confirming patency . For any depot 
replacemen ts, IOP assessments should be completed prior to 
replacement. The subject will continue to return for follow-up 
visits per the study schedule through the 12 Week Visit. The 
number of replacements will be tracked and documented on the appropriate Case Repor t Form (CRF).  
If the intracanalicular depot is still present at the [ADDRESS_900257] will return at th e 20 Week  Visit. The 
Investigator will attempt removal of the intracanalicular depot (s) 
from the respective eye(s) at this visit. The subject may be 
prescribed IOP -lowering drops if necessary at the 12 Week Visit 
at the Investigator’s discretion. 
For subje cts with Early Loss of Intracanalicular depot from 
the 6 Week  Visit prior to the 12 Week  Visit: 
At any visit from the 6 Week Visit prior to the 12 Week  Visit, if 
the intracanalicular depot  is not visualized  in one or both eyes by

Statistical Methods  Hypotheses: 
H0: The difference between study eyes that received  OTX-TP 
and study eyes that received  PV (OTX-TP minus PV), in mean 
IOP at the following time points: 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM at the 2 
Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week Visits, is ≥ [ADDRESS_900281] 
one time point over all visits.  
H1: The difference between study eyes that received  OTX-TP 
and study eyes that received  PV (OTX-TP minus PV), in mean 
IOP at the following time points: 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM at the 2 
Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week Visits, is < 0 mmHg for a ll time 
points over all visits.  
Sample Size : 
Assuming a common standard deviation of 3.75 mmHg within a 
treatment group, a mean difference of 1.5 mmHg or greater between treatment groups at each of the 3 time points of each of the 3 visits, and a 3:2 randomization ratio, 294 subjects in the 
OTX-TP arm and 196 subjects in the PV arm  yield >90% power 
to conclude superiority of OTX- TP to PV in mean IOP at all of 
the 9 time points using a 2-sided alpha = 0.05 and assuming independence among time points.  The power increases with increasing positive correlation among time points.  
To account for 10% of subjects discontinuing before the 12 Week Visit , approximately 330 subjects will be randomized into 
the OTX-TP arm and 220 subjects will be randomized into the 
PV arm.

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
OTX-16-002 Page 25 of 75 
Rev E: May 2, 2017 The primary analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will 
employ a linear model with IOP at the given visit ( 2 Week, 6 
Week, and 12 Week) and time point (8 AM, 10AM, and 4PM ) as 
the response, time point specific baseline IOP as a covariate, and 
treatment as a main effect factor, using the intent to treat 
population with multiple imputation methods using Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach to impute missing data  and using last 
time-consistent observation carried forward  to impute data for 
time points after a subject’s study eye is prescribed IOP-
lowering drops .  Each time point within each visit will be 
modeled separately.  The least squares mean differences (test – 
control) between OTX -TP and PV will be presented along with 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the difference and 2-sided p- values testing the difference equal to 0.  Inference 
will be made on the 2- sided p-value at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 at 
each time point and visit.   
The study will be considered a success if the 2 -sided p-value < 
0.05 and the point estimate of the difference is < [ADDRESS_900282] 
(LOCF), and baseline time-consistent observation carried 
forward to impute missing values and observed data only.  Additionally, sensitivity analyses will be performed on the per protocol population using observed data only.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 3. INTRODUCTION 
Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (OTX) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_666883] g products to address unmet and underserved medical needs in ophthalmology. 
OTX was founded to further develop its proprietary polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel 
technology in various ophthalmic applications. Ocular Therapeutix has designed a bioabsorbable intracanalicular depot as the platform for drug delivery products, which can be used to deliver 
various active pharmaceutical ingredients  that have been included in other FDA-approved drug 
products.  The intracanalicular depot  is designed to be inserted into the inferior or superior 
punctum and then be retained in the canaliculus  for the entire duration in which the drug is being 
delivered.  Over this time and through hydrolysis, the intracanalicular depot  softens, liquefies 
and is cleared through the naso lacrimal duct. Another similar hydrogel product, ReSure Sealant, 
manufactured by [CONTACT_666902] (reference PMA P130004) on January 8, 2014.

Elevated fluid pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure, IOP), defined as pressures above the normal range of [ADDRESS_900285] is a synthetic prostaglandin F 2α analogue. Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] (Z)-7- [(1 R ,2 R ,3 R ,5 S )-3,5-dihydroxy-2-[(1 E ,3 R )-3-hydroxy-4- [(α,α,α-trifluoro-m–isopropyl-tolyl)oxy]-1-
butenyl]-cyclopentyl] -5-heptenoate.  It is a prostaglandin analogue that is enzymatically 
converted to a free acid form in human cornea. Travoprost free acid is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed t o reduce IOP by [CONTACT_666903].  Travoprost is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Travatan

• Limited accuracy of drops getting into the eye  
• Potential washout of drops  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  
• Prostaglandin associated periorbitopathy4 
With potential blindness being the long term effect of poorly managed glaucoma, subject compliance and proper inst illation of eye drop medications become highly critical issue s.  Studies 
have shown less than 50% of glaucoma subjects continue therapy and refill prescriptions as required

expected to have significant advantages over the commercially available eye drops treatments  in 
that it:   
• Remains in the lacrimal canal iculus for desired duration of therapy, eliminating subject 
non-compliance.   
• Delivers therapeutic levels of travoprost continuously for the intended duration of 
therapy.

prospective, single- arm feasibility clinical evaluation  enrolled a total of 20 subjects (20 eyes).  
All subjects were adults undergoing clear corneal cataract surgery. There were no adverse events or serious adverse events reported.  Additionally, the safety assessments performed throughout the follow-up period did not raise any safety concerns. Ocular Therapeutix is conducting non- significant risk  IDE medical device clinical trials in the 
[LOCATION_002] to evaluate the PEG hydrogel intracanalicular depot for acute placement, retention, 
visualization and comfort as well as the safety of the intracanalicular depot  replacement as would 
be required for ongoing delivery of treatment in a chronic disorder. This is a bioabsorbable hydrogel i ntracanalicular depot  (i.e., the PV) that does not contain any active  pharmaceutical 
ingredient. To date, no serious adverse events related to the PV have been reported, and no safety 
concerns have been raised.  
3.2.1. Prior Experience with Travoprost  
Travoprost, the active drug component of the OTX-TP, is a synthetic prostaglandin F2α analogue used for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in subjects with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Travoprost is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Travatan®, Travatan Z ® and 
Izba™ (Alcon Laboratories Inc ., Fort Worth, TX) which have been approved by [CONTACT_666906] 021257, 021994 and 204822, respectively.  
3.3. Description of Intracanalicular depot   
3.3.1. OTX -TP (sustained release travoprost) Intracanalicular Depot  
The OTX-TP drug product is a fluorescent dried polyethylene glycol based, rod- shaped hydrogel 
intracanalicular depot  designed to be placed in the superior or inferior canaliculus . The hydrogel 
swells on contact [CONTACT_261224], thus holding the intracanalicular depot  in 
place.  Once OTX -TP swells to fill the canaliculus, it is contained in the canaliculus until the 
hydrogel is resorbed. OTX-TP contains conjugated fluorescein to serve as a visualization aid through the use of a blue light source and yellow filter to confirm product presence.  
Embedded in OTX-TP are poly (- lactic- acid) (PLA) microparticles which contain encapsulated 
travoprost, the active pharmaceutical ingredient.  The microparticles are bioabsorbable particles designed to release travoprost in a controlled fashion over the intended duration of therapy. OTX-TP contains approximately 0.[ADDRESS_900299] is slowly released over a period of up to approximately 90 days.

Rev E: May 2, [ADDRESS_900300] is packaged in a hermetically sealed foil p ouch to maintain stability and sterility 
over time.  It is placed into the punctum by [CONTACT_261225].  
3.3.2. Placebo Vehicle Intracanalicular depot  (PV)  
The PV consists of the same components as OTX-TP, except that it does not contain travoprost. 
The PV will be provided in the same packaging as OTX- TP to maintain masking for the clinical 
trial. 
3.4. Intended Use  
The intended use that will be utilized in this study is stated below.  
OTX-TP (sustained release travoprost) Intracanalicular Depot is intended for the reduction of 
elevated intraocular pressure in subjects with open -angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OH). 
3.5. Study Design and Duration  
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel -arm, double masked, placebo vehicle 
controlled tri al to evaluate the safety and IOP-lowering efficacy of OTX -TP, a sustained release 
drug product placed in the canaliculus of the eye lid in subjects with open- angle glaucoma or 
ocular hypertension.  A total of up to 550 subjects ( 1100 eyes) with a clinical diagnosis of open-
angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes will receive either OTX -TP or PV  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX -TP.   
The subjects enrolled in this parallel -arm study will be randomized to receive either OTX -TP 
(sustained r elease travoprost)  Intracanalicular Depot  or PV (placebo vehicle) intracanalicular 
depot, respectively.  Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive OTX- TP in either 
the superior or inferior canaliculus of each affected eye on Day 1.  Subjects randomized to the 
control group will receive PV in either the superior or inferior canaliculus  of each affected eye 
on Day 1.   Subject randomization is 3:2 with a total of approximately 330 subjects in the OTX- TP arm and 
220 in the PV  arm. Randomization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_666907]-hypertensive therapy.  
Both eyes will receive either OTX -TP or PV , but only the eye with the higher IOP at 8:00AM at 
Baseline Visit [ADDRESS_900301] the same IOP at 
8AM on Baseline Visit 2 (Day 1), the right eye will be the study eye and the left eye will be considered the secondary study eye. All eyes will be included in the safety analysis. All eyes will 
be included in the safety analysis.  
Subjects currently being treated with a prostaglandin analogue  at the time of the Screening Visit 
will undergo a 6 week (- 2 days/+ 3 days)  washout period starting at t he Screening Visit and 
prior to Baseline Visit 1.  The Baseline Visit 2/Insertion Visit, Day [ADDRESS_900302] two 
IOP measurements will be taken over a two week period (Run- in Visit 1 at 2 days [+ 3 days]

of prostaglandin therapy). The Run- in IOP measurements will be conducted at 8 AM +/ - 1 hour, 
to confirm the response to prostaglandin the rapy. Once the response is confirmed, the subjects 
will undergo a 6 week (- 2 days/+ 3 days)  washout period prior to Baseline Visit 1. The Baseline

after completing Informed Consent and the Screening  Visit. They will then be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor, in order to obtain written approval to be allowed to participate in the current study. The approval will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. Timing and requirements for the period between Screening and Baseline Visit 1 will vary, please refer to Appendix A   for 
additional specifications.  At Baseline Visit 2/Insertion Visit, if insertion is unsuccessful in one eye, the intracanalicular depot from the contralateral eye (if already inserted) will not be removed. The subject will be 
prescribed IOP -lowering drops at the Investigator’s discretion for the eye that did not receive a 
depot.  The subjects will be followed for safety only, and the eye that received a depot will be 
included in the safety analysis. The study will be supplemented with additional subjects to account for t hese subjects in order to ensure that the necessary number of subjects who received 
a depot bilaterally are followed through the [ADDRESS_900306] will begin IOP-lowering drops at the Investigator’s discretion and 
followed through the remainder of the study for safety. 
For subjects w ith Early Loss of Intracanalicular Depot P rior to the 6 Week Visit : 
At any visit prior to the 6 Week Visit, if the intracanalicular depot  is not visualized  in one 
or both eyes by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator will insert a new intracanalicular depot  
in the respective eye(s) after confirming patency . For any depot replacements, IOP 
assessments should be completed prior to replacement. The subject will continue to 
return for follow -up visits per the study schedule through the 12 Week  Visit. The number 
of replacements will be tracked and documented on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF). 
If the intracanalicular depot is still present in one or both eyes at the 12 Week Visit, the 
Investigator will attempt to remove it (For removal methods, refer to Appendix C ). If 
removal is successful  bilaterally , the subject will be exited from the study upon 
confirmation of the bilateral absence of the intracanalicular depot. If the intracanalicular 
depot is not present bilaterally at the [ADDRESS_900307] will 
return at the 20 Week  Visit. The Investigator will attempt removal of intracanalicular 
depot from the respective eye (s) at this visit. The subject may be prescribed IOP -
lowering drops if necessary at the 12 Week  Visit at the Investigator’s discretion.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 For subjects with Early Loss of Intracanalicular depot from the 6 Week  Visit prior to the 12 
Week Visit: 
At any visit from the 6 Week Visit prior to the 12 Week  Visit, if the intracanalicular 
depot is not visualized  in one or both eyes by [CONTACT_737] , the Investigator will insert 
a new intracanalicular depot in the respective eye(s) after confirming patency. For any 
depot replacements, IOP assessments should be completed prior to replacement. The 
subject will return for follow -up visits through the 12 Week  Visit and then at the 20 
Week Visit. The number of replacements will be tracked and documented on the 
appropriate CRF.  
At the 20 Week Visit, the Investigator will attempt removal of the replacement 
intracanalicular depot (s), if still present. If removal at the [ADDRESS_900308] will be 
required to return to the clinic every 30 (± 10) days until the intracanalicular depot  is 
confirmed to be no longer present or removal of the intracanalicular depot  is successful  
for the respective eye(s) . Removal will be attempted at every visit until the 
intracanalicular depot  is no longer present. 
If the intracanalicular depot is not pre sent bilaterally at the [ADDRESS_900309] may be prescribed IOP-
lowering drops if necessary at the 20 Week  Visit at the Investigator’s discretion.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 Rescue Therapy for Subjects with unacceptable IOP increase after treatment:  
If at any visit prior to and including the [ADDRESS_900310]’s IOP is increasing to unacceptable levels , the Investigator will prescribe IOP 
lowering drops at his or her discretion and will confirm adequate IOP lowering response 
at the next visit.  The IOP lowering medication should be recorded on the appropriate CRF. The intracanalicular depot will not be removed, and the subject will be followed 
through the 12 Week Visit for the remaining scheduled study visits .  
Additionally, if at any point in the study, the Investigator determines that the IOP is not adequately controlled, IOP -lowering drops may be provided as rescue therapy at the 
Investigator’s discretion to ensure the subject’s safety.  
The study will be conducted at up to [ADDRESS_900311] (IRB) approval. A site may randomize up  to a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_900312] received previous treatment, and how long the intracanalicular depot is retained

Rev E: May 2, 2017 4.5.2. Data Collection 
Data collected from all study procedures and assessments will be collected and documented on 
the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF) for the study.  All data should be entered in compliance 
with the latest version of the eCRF Completion Guidelines.  
4.5.3. Subject Enrollment  
Prior to enrollment in the study, subjects will be evaluated to determine potential eligibility. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be determined. If the 
subject desires to participate in the study, written informed consent will be obtained prior to 
performance of any study -specific examinations. Following all the ba seline assessments, the 
subject will be assessed to determine if the eligibility criteria are met. If the subject meets the 
procedural eligibility requirement and agrees to participate, the subject will be  randomized.  
A subject is considered enrolled in t he study at the time the subject signs the Informed Consent 
Form.  Once a subject qualifies for the study and is randomized, they must be followed whether 
or not the subject received the study assigned treatment. In the event that after randomization the insertion of the intracanalicular depot is successful in the first eye, but unsuccessful in the second eye, the intracanalicular depot  will not be removed from the first eye and the subject will be 
prescribed IOP -lowering drops at the Investigator’s discretion for the eye that did not receive the 
depot.  The subjects will be followed for safety only, and the eye that received the depot will be included in the safety analysis. The study will be supplemented with additional subjects  in order 
to ensure that up to [ADDRESS_900321] version of the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines. For subjects who fail eligibility criteria at the Baseline Visit, the reason for the screen  failure will 
be clearly delineated on the applicable eCRF.   
All subjects who receive a depot in the study will be required to adhere to the follow-up schedule 
outlined in this protocol.  Subjects withdrawing consent after insertion initiation will not be required to undergo follow-up after withdrawal; however, t hese subjects will still be considered 
part of the study cohort to which they were originally assigned. 
4.5.4. Informed Consent  
Once a study candidate’s eligibility has been determined and the Investigator agrees, a member 
of the research team will present the st udy to the subject. The background of the proposed study, 
the study procedures, follow up schedule, and the risks and potential benefits of the procedures and study will be explained to the subject. Prior to enrollment in the study, all subjects must review and complete an IRB approved Informed Consent Form (ICF). Failure to obtain a signed ICF renders the subject ineligible for the study.  Subjects must be willing to return to the clinic

Rev E: May 2, 2017 for study visits at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks after the insertion as required.  Additional visits 
may be required based on depot replacement.   
4.5.5. Randomization 
Prior to the initiation of the study, a treatment randomization sc heme will be generated using a 
3:2 ratio (Active Treatment to Placebo Control) .  Randomization wil l be stratified by 
[CONTACT_76537] (i.e., one randomization schema per study site) and previous ocular anti -
hypertensive therapy with 3 levels:  
Stratum A : Subjects who were on prostaglandin treatment at the time of the Screening 
Visit and have shown an adequate IOP rise after a 6 -week washout (interval from 
Screening to Baseline Visit  1 is 6 weeks).  This may include subjects exiting from a prior 
ophthalmic investigational research study based on based on criteria specified in 
Appendix A  . 
Stratum B : Subjects who were treatment -naïve at Screening and have shown an adequate 
prostaglandin response after a 2- week run-in period on prostaglandin treatment followed 
by a 6-week washout (interval from Screening to Ba seline Visit 1 is 8 weeks). This  may 
include subjects exiting from a prior ophthalmic investigational research study  based on 
based on criteria specified in Appendix A  . 
Stratum C : Subjects who have recently exit ed from a prior ophthalmic investigational 
research study and have written approval from the Medical Monitor to be allowed to participate in the current study  without additional exposure to prostaglandin (Refer to  
Appendix A  ). 
Once it is determined that the subject continues to meet eligibility  for the study at Baseline Visit 
2, the subject will be randomized into the study through assigning the next sequential kit within the kits corresponding to the subjects previous ocular anti -hypertensive therapy category and 
both eyes will be provided with the same assigned treatment, OTX -TP or PV. 
4.5.6. Masking  
The Investigator and the subject will be masked to the treatment assignment throughout the duration of therapy.  At the conclusion of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_666888]-TP or PV. Subjects in both groups 
will be prescribed IOP -lowering drops based on the Investigator’s discretion.   
OTX-TP and the PV are identical in appearance, and will be supplied in identical packages so as they cannot be distinguished by [CONTACT_28024].  If it is medically necessary to identify the product used, the Investigator will follow procedures outlined in Section  5.6.  
4.5.7. Study Assessments  
Please refer to Appendix B  for procedures for conducting the study assessments (e.g. BCVA, slit 
lamp biomicroscopy, ocular hyperemia grading, pachymetry, IOP measurement, dilated fundus 
exam, gonioscopy, automated perimetry and punctum exam).

4.7.2. Minimization of Risks  
With any new product, there is always chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_124923] .  Not all risks of 
using OTX-TP are known.  However, the risks associated with OTX-TP have been minimized by 
[CONTACT_666917]- TP clinical development program as 
well as by  [CONTACT_666918] a long history of 
safe use in ophthalmic drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. Furthermore, results of biocompatibility and preclinical testing when evaluated at a comparable dose, demonst rate OTX -
TP does not invoke an inflammatory or toxic response from ocular tissues. 
Subjects will be selected and enrolled using clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure that subjects with ocular or periocular anatomy and/or comorbidities that put them at 
higher risk for procedural complications are excluded. Appropriate therapeutic intervention following standard medical practices will be used in the event of medical complications including the use of rescue medication. If IOP is unreasona bly high in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], the protocol allows rescue medication to be administered to the subjects , at any 
point throughout the study. The specific medication regimen will be at the Principal 
Investigators’ discretion.  Safety checks wil l be conducted at every scheduled visit, however the 
investigator may initiate rescue therapy and any time during the study.  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_1052]/or its CRO designates to ensure the 
identification, documentation and analysis of all adverse events, compliance with the protocol, the terms of the participating IRB’s to protect the safety and rights of all subjects, and applicable Federal regulations. To minimize safety risks to the subjects, o nly those investigators trained for

OTX-16-002   Page 54 of 75 
Rev E: May 2, 2017 treating subjects with glaucoma or ocular hypertension will be considered for participation as 
investigators in this study. For all investigators who will use the intracanalicular depot , only 
those who are experienced in intracanalicular depot  insertion will be  considered and all 
investigators will be required to undergo training per the OTX- TP Instructions for Use by [CONTACT_9323]/or its designates prior to initial use.  
4.7.3. Potential Benefits  
The benefits of OTX-TP are not yet known, but are thought to be the reduction of elevated 
intraocular pressure and improved treatment outcome through eliminating subject non-
compliance with the use of daily drops.   
4.8. Product Malfunctions  
All malfunctions of OTX -TP or PV will be documented on the appropriate eCRF and reported to 
Ocular Therapeutix within 24 hours. Ocular Therapeutix will advise whether the intracanalicular 
depot(s) should be returned for analysis. The incidence of malfunctions will be included in the final analysis.  
4.9. Subject Withdrawal  
For any subject who withdraws their consent following randomization, to the extent possible, the reason(s) for withdrawal will be documented on the End of Study eCRF. Subjects will be asked, but not required, to return for removal of the intracanalicular depot (if still present) prior to withdrawing from the study.  Every attempt will be made to contact [CONTACT_666919]-compliant or lost to follow -up and such attempts will be documented in the subject’s study 
record.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 5. ADVERSE EVENTS (AES)  
Throughout the course of the study, all e fforts will be made to remain alert to possible adverse 
events or untoward findings.  If adverse events occur, the first concern will be the safety and 
welfare of the subject.  Appropriate medical intervention will be undertaken.  Any adverse events observed by [CONTACT_357578], whether or not ascribed to the study treatment, will be recorded on the subject’s Adverse Event Case Report Form.  A new Adverse Event Case Report Form is used for each adverse event.  
Documentation regarding the adverse event should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, and relationship to study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].   
5.1. Definitions 
Adverse Event (or Adverse Experience, AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
Adverse Ocular Event  
An adverse ocular event is an adverse event that affects ocular tissues, the nasolacrimal duct, sinuses or vision. All adverse ocular events are a subset of adverse events Note: Subjects will be queried for the presence or absence of the following ocular complaints: 
excessive tearing, fo reign body sensation, stinging/burning, and itching. Positive responses to 
these standardized ocular complaint inquiries should be reported as ocular complaints and not adverse ocular events unless the complaint: meets  the criteria of a specific event as l isted, and/ or 
is: outside of normal limits,  associated with clinical sequelae (e.g., adverse slit lamp examination 
findings), and requires an intervention to be resolved. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Ocular Event (or TE AE)  
An adverse ocular event  will be co nsidered a treatment -emergent AE  if it occurs or worsens on 
or after the initiation of the intracanalicular depot  insertion.  
Adverse Reaction (or Related Adverse Event or Adverse Effect)  
An adverse reaction is any noxious and unintended response to the tr eatment. 
Unexpected Adverse Reaction (Unanticipated Adverse Effect)  
An unexpected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature (including specificity and 
outcome) or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information. For this study, the study protocol; Investigator's Brochure; and prescribing information for the registered formulation of travoprost (Travatan
®) will be used to assess events for unexpectedness.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 Serious Adverse Event (Serious Adverse Experience)  
A serious adver se event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death  
• is life-threatening  
(The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the even t; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• is sight threatening  
Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result  in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46822]. These should also usually be considered serious.
8 
5.2. Severity  
Severity of an adverse event is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild:  Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with  the subject’s daily activities . 
• Moderate: Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
 interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe: Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, 
and  interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
 
                                                 
 
8 The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events  that pose a threat to life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) and causality serve as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. (Severity of all adverse events, ocular and non- ocular, will be 
reported according to the terminology defined in the protocol.)

Rev E: May 2, 2017 5.3. Relationship to OTX -TP or PV 
The following table will be used by [CONTACT_1694] a guide when assessing the causal 
relationship of an adverse event to the intracanalicular depot  and the insertion procedure. 
NO RELATIONSHIP 
SUSPECTED  This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful consideration , are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
RELATIONSHIP 
SUSPECTED  
 The following criteria should be applied in considering inclusion of an adverse event in this category:  
1) It bears a reasonable temporal relatio nship to the insertion procedure or the 
presence of the intracanalicular depot. 
2)  It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
3)  It disappears or decreases on removal of the intracanalicular depot . 
4)  It follows a known pattern of response to the insertion procedure or the 
intracanalicular depot . 
UNABLE TO DETERMINE*  The Investigator is unable to assess the relati onship of the event to the insertion 
procedure or the intracanalicular depot . 
*Where the causal relationship of the AE to the insertion procedure or the intracanalicular depot  has not been 
determined or is unknown, the AE will be treated as if a relations hip is suspected for the purposes of regulatory 
reporting.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study drug caused the adverse event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event. Types of evidence 
that would suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event include: a 
single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure; one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
5.4. Expectedness  
The expectedness of an adverse event should be determined based upon existing safety information about the study drug using these explanations: 
• Unexpected:  An adverse ev ent or adverse reaction that is not listed in the study 
protocol, Investigator’s brochure, or  prescribing information for the 
registered formulation of travoprost (Travatan
®) or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected : An adverse event that is listed in the Investigator’s brochure at the 
 specificity and severity that has been observed.  
Adverse events that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation are to be considered unexpected.

5.5. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All adverse events that are “serious ” and “unexpected” and related to the study drug are to be 
reported to Ocular Therapeutix and the IRB as required by [CONTACT_1201], federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities.  All serious events, regardless of their expectedness or relatedness are to be reported to Ocular Therapeutix within [ADDRESS_900340] will be recorded on the appropriate case report form(s). To the extent possible, the event to be recorded and reported is the event diagnos is as 
opposed to event symptoms  (e.g., symptoms of vision loss or diplopia associated with 
intraocular lens dislocation; the event should be documented as intraocular lens dislocation).  Details and symptomology associated with the event may be reported in  the narrative section of 
the Adverse Event Case Report Form.   Any serious adverse experiences or any severe, sight -threatening adverse reactions, whether 
ascribed to the study treatment or not, will be communicated within [ADDRESS_900341] obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject; provide OTX with a complete case history, which 
includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the study drug; and inform the IRB of the adverse event within the IRB’s guidelines for reporting SAEs.  A written report detailing the event, signed by [CONTACT_737], shall be submitted to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_900342] be followed up and the outcome reported.   
5.5.1. Specific Anticipated Adverse Ocular Events  
Anticipated adverse ocular events that may be associated with OTX -TP or PV include, but are 
not necessarily limited to: 
• Ocular hyperemia should be considered as an AE only if the subject complains of it or if 
the subject  is discontinued because of ocular hyperemia 
• Prostaglandin Associated Orbitopathy 
• Iris discoloration  
• Blepharitis  
• Worsening in BCVA defined as ≥ 3 lines ( ≥15letters)  
• Subconjunctival hemorrhage 
• Cataract 
• Macular edema  
• Conjunctivitis  
• Keratitis 
• Perforation of or trauma to the punctum and/or surrounding tissues 
• Allergic reaction  
• Chemosis

• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_119230], defined as clinically significant excessive tearing outside of normal limits  
• Dacryocystitis 
• Tearing with mucopurulent discharge  
• Stenosis of the punctum  
• Infection*  
*Note: In the case of a suspected infection, a culture should be performed and the organism identified , if possible . 
5.6. Procedures for Unmasking  
When medically necessary, the Investigator may need to determine the treatment that has been 
assigned to a subject. The Investigator will contact [CONTACT_666920]. Ocular Therapeutix will make the final determination if the unmasking request will be granted. If granted, the Investigator will be permitted to use the unmasking instructions available on site.  
At the conclusion of the [ADDRESS_900343] been removed bilaterally, the Investigator may be unmasked to the treatment assignment of 
the subjects who were assigned  to OTX-TP or PV as those subjects may require IOP-lowering 
drops.   
5.7. Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
Adverse Events (AEs) will be followed until:  
• Resolution (return to baseline status or to ‘normal’) 
o AEs may be determined to have resolved (completely) or resolved with sequelae.  
• Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_167246], for events that do not end (i.e., metastasis), the 
condition to be chronic. The event can be determined to be resolved or resolved with 
sequelae. 
• Stabilization of the event has occurred (no worsening expected by [CONTACT_31691]) 
Adverse events will be documented on the appropriate Case Report Form.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
6.1. Study Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT): The ITT population will include all randomized subjects with a primary 
study eye in which an  intracanalicular depot  was inserted . Analysis on the ITT population will be 
used as the primary  efficacy analysis and will be performed for all  efficacy endpoints, analyzing 
subjects under the treatment to which they were randomized.  
Per Protocol (PP):  The PP population will include all ITT subjects who do not deviate from the 
protocol in any way likely to seriously affect the efficacy outcomes of the study.  Analysis on the 
PP population will be used as secondary efficacy analysis and will be performed for select  
efficacy endpo ints, analyzing subjects under the treatment actually received.  Important protocol 
deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial, subject management, or subject assessment will be identified prior to locking the study d atabase. 
Safety:  The Safety population will include all subjects who received any investigation study 
medication (OTX -TP or PV). Analyses performed on the Safety population will be according to 
the treatment  the subjects actually received . 
6.2. Unit of Analysi s 
The unit of analysis in this study will be the primary study eye for  all efficacy summaries and 
any eye that received a depot for ocular safety summaries. The primary study eye will be defined 
as the study eligible eye with ocular hypertension or open an gle glaucoma that meets the IOP 
enrollment criteria and has an  intracanalicular depot  successfully inserted.  If a subject has both 
eyes eligible, then the primary study eye will be the eye with the highest IOP at 8AM on 
Baseline Visit 2 (Day 1)  and the other eye will be considered to be the secondary study eye ; if 
both eyes are eligible and have the same IOP at 8AM on Baseline Visit 2 (Day 1), the right eye 
will be the study eye and the left eye will be considered the secondary study eye.    Ocular adverse events will be presented at the eye and subject level and non -ocular adverse events will 
be presented at the subject level.  
6.3. Imputation Methods  
The primary analyses of efficacy data (IOP) will employ multiple imputation methods using 
Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach to impute missing data and using last time-consistent 
observation carried forward (LOCF) to impute data for time  points after a subject’s primary 
study eye is prescribed IOP-lowering drops.  Sensitivity analyses, to determine robustness of results, will be performed using Monte Carlo 
Markov Chain approach to impute non-monotone missing information and pattern mixture 
models control-based pattern imputation for monotone missing information (including subjects who drop out and data for time points after a subject’s primary study eye is prescribed IOP -
lowering drops) , LOCF to impute both missing data and data after a subject’s primary study eye 
is prescribed IOP -lowering drops, and baseline time-consistent observation carried forward to 
impute both missing data and data after a subject’s primary study eye is prescribed IOP -lowering 
drops and observed data only.  Additionally, sensitivity analyses will be performed on the per protocol population using observed data only.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 6.4. Hypotheses  
H0: The difference between study eyes that received  OTX-TP and study eyes that received  PV 
(OTX-TP minus PV), in mean IOP at the following time points: 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM at the 2 
Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week Visits, is ≥ [ADDRESS_900344] one time point over all visits.  
H1: The difference between study eyes that received  OTX-TP and study eyes that received  PV 
(OTX-TP minus PV), in mean IOP at the following time points: 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM at the 2 
Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week Visits, is < 0 mmHg for a ll time points over all visits.  
6.5. Efficacy Variables  
6.5.1. Primary  
• Mean IOP at the following time points 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM at the 2 Week, 6 Week, and 
12 Week Visits .  
6.5.2. Secondary  
• Mean change from baseline IOP at the followin g time points 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM at the 2 
Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week Visits.  
• Mean percent change from baseline IOP at the following time points 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM 
at the 2 Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week Visits.  
6.6. Safety Variables  
The safety variables are:  
• Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
• Assessment and grade of ocular hyperemia (at slit lamp)  
• Subject ocular comfort assessment  
• Dilated fundus exam 
• Adverse events  
6.7. Sample Size  
Assuming a common standard deviation of 3.75 mmHg within a treatment group, a mean 
difference of 1.5 mmHg or greater between treatment groups at each of the 3 time points of each of the 3 visits, and a 3:2 randomization ratio, 294 subjects in the OTX- TP arm subjects and 196 
subjects in the PV arm yield >90% power to conclude superiority of OTX-TP to PV in mean IOP 
at all of the 9 time points using a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 and assuming independence among time 
points.  The power increases with increasing positive correlation among time points. 
To account for 10% of subjects discontinuing before the 12 Week Visit , approximately 330 
subjects will be randomized into the OTX- TP arm and 220 subjects will be randomized into the 
PV arm.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 6.8. Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis is planned after all subjects complete the 12 Week Visit.  As this interim 
analysis will be the final analysis for efficacy:  
1) All efficacy data will be cleaned and monitored prior to unmasking and conducting the 
interim analysis  
2) No alpha adjustments for multiplicity will be made.  
  
At this interim analysis, th e study team will be unmasked with the exception of the 
Investigator/investigative site staff and the subject 
6.9. Methods of Analyses  
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Minima and maxima will be reported with the same precision as the raw values; means, standard deviations, and medians will be presented to one additional decimal place than reported in the raw values. Summaries for discrete variables will include frequencies an d percentages. All percentages will be rounded to one decimal place (i.e., 
XX.X%). Differences between treatment groups will be calculated as OTX -TP minus PV and 
change from baseline will be calculated as follow -up visit minus baseline. The baseline visit will 
be defined as the last non- missing measure prior to initiation of investigational treatment.  For 
IOP the baseline time point will be defined as the last non -missing time equivalent measure prior 
to initiation of investigational treatment and after wa shout of previous IOP medication.  All 
efficacy summaries will be presented for the primary study eye.  Additional analyses may be reported for secondary study eyes. All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_666921].  
6.10. Demogra phic and Baseline Medical History  
Subject demographics: gender, ethnicity, race,  age category ( < 65 years and ≥ 65 years) , and iris 
color will be presented using discrete summary statistics. Age will also be presented using continuous summary statistics.  
Non-ocular and ocular medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_666922].  
6.11. Efficacy Analyses  
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will employ a linear model with IOP at the given visit ( 2 Week, 6 Week, and 12 Week) and time point (8AM , 10AM, and 4PM ) as the 
response, time point specific baseline IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, 
using the ITT population with multiple imputation methods using Monte Carlo Markov Chain 
approach to impute missin g data and using LOCF to impute data for time  points after a subject’s 
study eye is prescribed IOP-lowering drops .  Each time point within each visit will be modeled 
separately.  The least squares mean differences (test – control) between OTX-TP and PV will be 
presented along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the difference and 2-sided 
p-values testing the difference equal to 0.  Inference will be made on the 2 -sided p-value at a 2 -
sided alpha = 0.05 at each time point and visit.  The study will be considered a success if the 2 -
sided p-value < 0.05 (demonstrating statistical superiority)  and the point estimate of the 
difference is < 0 at all time points over the three visits.

Rev E: May 2, [ADDRESS_900345] p-values and two -sided 95% t-distribution CI’s will also be computed around 
the difference in mean IOP between treatment groups at each time point and visit for the primary analysis data (ITT population employing  multiple imputation metho ds using Monte Carlo 
Markov Chain approach to impute missing data and using LOCF to impute data for time  points 
after a subject’s study eye is prescribed IOP -lowering drops as rescue therapy ).  Similar 
summaries will be presented on the ITT population using LOCF to impute both missing data and data after a subject’s primary study eye is prescribed IOP -lowering drops as rescue therapy and 
for the ITT and per protocol populations using observed data only. 
Mean change from baseline IOP will be analyzed similar ly to the primary endpoint analysis, 
including all sensitivity analyses.   
Mean percent change from baseline IOP will be analyzed using two -sample t-tests and two -sided 
95% t-distribution CI’s for the primary analysis data ( ITT population employing  multiple 
imputation methods using Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach to impute missing data and using LOCF to impute data for time  points after a subject’s study eye is prescribed IOP- lowering 
drops as rescue therapy ).  Similar summaries will be presented on the I TT population using 
LOCF to impute both missing data and data after a subject’s primary study eye is prescribed IOP-lowering drops as rescue therapy and for the ITT and per protocol populations using 
observed data only.   IOP measures and change from basel ine IOP measures from non- primary visits will be analyzed 
and summarized similarly to the mean percent change from baseline IOP.  
Additionally, as secondary analyses to further understand efficacy within each previous ocular anti-hypertensive therapy category, the primary analysis strategy will be completed separately 
for the subgroups of subjects within each previous ocular anti -hypertensive therapy category.  
6.12. Other Analyses 
Visualization of the intracanalicular depot  by [CONTACT_666923] w ill be 
summarized at each time point using discrete summary statistics.  
Ocular complaints will be summarized using discrete summary statistics at the eye level as well as at the subject level for all eyes  that received a depot . 
6.13. Safety Analyses  
The primary safety analysis will summarize treatment emergent ocular AEs (TEAE) separately for primary study eyes and secondary study eyes using discrete summaries at the eye and event level by [CONTACT_20623].  A TEAE wil l be 
defined as occurring on or after the day  treatment is initiated. Treatment emergent non -ocular 
AEs will be summarized using discrete summaries at the subject and event level by [CONTACT_20623]. Treatment related treatment emergent ocular and non-ocular AEs will be summarized similarly. Treatment emergent ocular and non -ocular 
AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_926].  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated fundoscopy measures will be summarized at each time point using discrete summary statistics.

0 = None             1 = Mild            2 = Moderate            3 = Severe  
Using the slit lamp biomicroscope, the subject’s eye(s) should be examined and compared to the 
images depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2. A grade (0 -3) should be assigned and noted on the appropriate CRF 
based on the images. 0.[ADDRESS_900354]’s hyperemia is between 2 images.  
D.  Pachymetry  
The following procedure is recommended for conducting pachymetry: Central corneal thickness measurements of each eye will be made at the screening visit using an ultrasonic pachymeter. Measurements will  be made after IOP is taken. For ultrasound probes, the 
Probe Quality Factor must be greater than or equal to 85% (if applicable). With the subject seated and visualizing a consistent fixation target, position the probe tip on the cornea, perpendicular to the corneal surface, on the visual axis (i.e., centered on the pupil). Once the probe tip is positioned properly, take a measurement. A total of [ADDRESS_900355] in

Rev E: May 2, [ADDRESS_900356] for tonometry is quite accurate and 
reproducible if proper technique is used.  When performing Goldmann tonometry the following procedures should be followed: 1. Pre-tonometry procedures:  Set tonometer in the correct position and make sure the prism 
is in the horizontal position on the slit lamp. Set the tension at [ADDRESS_900357] the tarsal conjunctiva of the lower lid  of each eye, taking care not to 
flood the ocular surface with fluorescein dye. Alternatively a  drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413]-
fluorescein (e.g., Fluress) solution may be instilled into  the lower conjunctival fornix of 
each eye, taking care not to flood the ocular surface with fluorescein dye.  Ask subject to blink a few times just prior to tonometry.   
3. Place subject in adjustable chair so chin can fit comfortably on the slit lamp chin rest and the forehead can be snug against the forehead bar.  
4. Apply tonometer to the subject’s eye while subject looks straight ahead and increase the force of applanation until the observer sees the inner portion of the two half fluorescein circles are touching. Record pressure on the case report form. 
IOP measuremen t will be masked based on the following procedure: 
Measurements will be taken by [CONTACT_666927] a Goldmann applanation tonometer affixed to a slit lamp with the subject seated.  One person will adjust the dial in maske d fashion and a second person will read and record the value.  The subject and slit 
lamp should be adjusted so that the subject’s head is firmly positioned on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without leaning forward or straining.  Both eyes will be tested, with the right eye preceding the left eye.  Each IOP measurement is to be recorded.  
One person (“the measurer”) looks through the binocular viewer of the slit lamp at low power.  The tension knob is pre- set at a low pressure value (4 to 6 mmHg) .  The measurer follows the 
image of the fluorescein -stained semicircles while he/she slowly rotates the tension knob until 
the inner borders of the fluorescein rings touch each other at the midpoint of their pulsation in response to the cardiac cycle.  When this image is reached, the measurer takes his/her fingers off the tension knob and the second person (“the reader”) reads and records the IOP reading along 
with the date and time of day in the source document, thus maintaining a masked IOP reading. Two measurements should be performed, and if the IOP is within [ADDRESS_900358] ophthalmoscopy examination without scleral depression. Each of the following will be evaluated and documented as normal , abnormal clinically significant or abnormal not clinically 
significant: macula, peripheral retina and  optic nerve.  The cup to disc (C/D) ratio will also be 
measured. Explanation/comment should be provided on the case report form for any abnormal pathology.

Rev E: May 2, 2017 G.  Gonioscopy 
The following procedure is recommended for conducting gonioscopy: 
Clean and sterilize the front (curved) surface of the goniolens. Apply lubricating fluid to the front surface. Anaesthetize the subject's cornea with topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413]. Prepare the slit lamp for 
viewing through the goniolens. Gently move the subject's eyelids away from the cornea. Slowly apply the goniolens to the ocular surface, forming suction. Fine- tune the slit lamp to optimize the 
view. The angle can now be viewed by [CONTACT_666928] 360 degrees.  Grade the 
angle based on the Shaffer System as follows.  Subjects with a Grade 2 or lower should be excluded for angle closure glaucoma.  
Grade 4 - 45º to 35º ang le Wide open  
Grade 3 - 35º to 20º angle Wide open 
Grade 2 - 20º angle Narrow 
Grade 1 - ≤ 10º angle Extremely narrow 
Slit - 0º angle Narrowed to slit 
H.  Automated Perimetry  
The following procedure is recommended for conducting automated perimetry. 
Measure the subject's pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324] (to the nearest 0.5 mm). If they are less than 3 mm in diameter, dilate them 
with 2.5% phenylephrine drops, unless contraindicated. If the brow is heavy or the upper lid is droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
tape accordingly. Visual field results must be reliable (i.e., 33% fixation losses, false positive or false 
negative errors) or the field should be repeated within two weeks. Visual field examinations will be performed using a Humphrey automated perimetry test (full threshold 24-[ADDRESS_900359] assessment ). Preferred equipment is the Humphrey 700 HFA-2 series machines (e.g., 740 or 750). 
Visual fields will be reported as normal or abnormal and the mean deviation will also be recorded in 
decibels (dB).  
Begin by [CONTACT_666929]. Adju st the chin rest and the table height as needed to achieve proper 
alignment as well as to maintain the subject in a comfortable seated position throughout the test. It is 
permissible to encourage the subject occasionally if the subject seems to be fatigued  or losing 
concentration, and to allow the subject to pause and rest if necessary. The subject should also be informed 
that a good time to blink is when the response button is pushed so as not to affect the results of the test.  
Repeat for the left eye.  
I.  Punctum Examination 
The punctum and surrounding area is to be examined and the following assessed: 
• Punctal appearance:  score as normal or abnormal  
• Lid apposition:  score as normal or abnormal 
• Tear meniscus:  score as normal or abnormal  
All abnormal findings will be graded as clinically significant or not clinically significant. 
Explanation/comments should be provided on the case report form for any abnormal observations.

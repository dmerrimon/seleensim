1.0 OBJECTIVES  
Primary: To assess overall survival from the date of diagnosis  in subjects with stage IV gastric and 
gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or imaging occult carcinomatosis after laparoscopic 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration.  
Secondary:   
1) To assess the safety of laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration 
for subjects with gastric and gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or imaging occult 
carcinomatosis . 
2) To assess the gastric resection rate in subjects with stage IV gastric and gastroesophageal  
cancer representing positive cytology or imaging occult carcinomatosis after laparoscopic 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration.   
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
Peritoneal carcinomatosis and microscopic peritoneal disease represents an aggressive mode of 
spread for gastric cancer which ultimately results in death.  Heated r egional peritoneal 
chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be effective in mesothel ioma  and appendiceal tumors.1, 2  
In addition, intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been found to improve survival in gastric cancer.3-5 
From January 1995 to December 2005, 3747 patients presented to M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.  Of those, 381 were without metastatic 
disease on radiologic imaging and underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for further staging prior to 
consideration for  neoadjuvant treatment.   Eighty -three patients had carcinomatosis on laparoscopy 
while 39 had positiv e cytology in the absence of carcinomatosis.  Carcinomatosis and positive 
cytology are classified as metastatic or Stage IV disease according to the American Joint 
Commission on Cancer Staging Manual (7th edition).[ADDRESS_313370] from serosal invasion and peritoneal 
spread rather than hematologic or lymphatic spread, and therefore are good candidates for local 
chemotherapy administration.  The population of patients with isolated peritoneal disease are also 
good candidates for a clinical trial as traditional treatment regimens yield dismal survival rates.  
Median OS (overall survival) for patients with positive peritoneal cytology and no visible metastatic 
disease at laparoscopy was 12.8 months while median OS was 10.2 months for patients with 
carcinomatosis at laparoscopy as displayed in Figure 1.7  For the patients with positive per itoneal 
cytology and no visible metastatic disease, use of neoadjuvant therapy (most often induction 5- FU 
and oxaliplatin followed by [CONTACT_30022] 45 Gy) resulted in a 3-year OS rate of 12% 
versus 0% for patients treated as having incurable stage IV disease.  For the patients with 
carcinomatosis at laparoscopy, outcomes were worse with 0% 3- year OS.  For the 122 patients with 
carcinomatosis at laparoscopy or positive cyt ology, only 8 (6.7%) underwent resection.  The 
proposed trial will focus  on the combined population of patients with radiologically occult 
carcinomatosis or positive cytology at laparoscopy.  
2013- [ADDRESS_313371]  19, 2015  
Page 5  
 
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)  is a surgical t echnique for combining 
hyperthermia and chemotherapeutic agents to the peritoneal surface via a heated perfusion circuit.[ADDRESS_313372] that 
performing laparoscopic HIPEC without cytoreduction and gastrectomy is a low risk procedure.  A 
recent systematic review of laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy suggests this 
is a safe procedure with no mortalities and < 10% morbidity in 183 patients.  Of note, however, is 
that only 5 patients in this series underwent this procedure as part of a neoadjuvant approach prior 
to cancer treatment.10  Therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy and 
safety of  laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with Mitomycin C and Cisplatin in 
patients  with stage IV gastric cancer after treatment with  systemic chemotherapy.

criteria (see eligibility criteria). HIPEC will be administered as defined by [CONTACT_760]. Patients will 
undergo lapar oscopic H IPEC as displayed in Figure 1.  Laparoscopic HIPEC will consist of 
Mitomycin C 30 mg and Cisplatin 200 mg in 3-7 liters of infusate circulated using an extracorporeal 
circulation d evice at a flow rate of 700- 1500 mL/minute for [ADDRESS_313377] scan , MRI, or PET/CT scan . Restaging will define 
two groups of subjects: 1) those whose disease progressed locally or who developed imaging 
evidence of distant metastatic disease, and 2) those whose disease has responded or remained 
stable. In addition, diagnos tic laparoscopy with peritoneal cytology and biopsy of any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_257963].  After laparosc opic HIPEC, 
subjects whose disease did not progress will proceed to surgery with diagnostic laparoscopy and 
possibly exploratory laparotomy to assess resectability, and if their cancer is resectable will undergo 
gastrectomy . After completion of study –related treatment, subjects will be followed until recurrence 
and/or death for up to five years.

2. After completion of the laparoscopic HIPEC  procedures , subjects without peritoneal 
carcinomatosis or positive cytology will be considered for gastrectomy.  Subjects will 
have a minimum [ADDRESS_313385]:  
1. History and physical and concurrent medications will be collected.  
2. Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) on days of clinic evaluation.  
3. Standard of care postoperative laboratory analysis.  
Survival  
1. The primary endpoint in this study is overall survival, as measured from the time of 
diagnosis . Patterns of tumor recurrence and survival will be assessed by [CONTACT_257975] . 
2. After completion of the treatment (HIPEC or gastrectomy),  all subjects will be followed 
with imaging  approximately every 6 months for five years.  
 
Criteria for Removal from Study:  
1. Inability of subject to comply with study requirements  
2. Determination by [CONTACT_257976] t he subject to continue 
therapy  
Correlative Studies: Tissue Banking  
All tissue samples will be collected according to MD Anderson  Tissue Protocol LAB01 -[ADDRESS_313386] format is on file with the IRB (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_30010] A. Ajani, 
M.D.).  Patients are consented prior to any endoscopic procedures performed at MD Anderson.  
Per the protocol and consent, i f the patient requires surgery as part of his/her treatment, a 
portion of the remaining  tissue will be stored.  No additional surgical maneuvers or procedures 
are necessary for the collection of study tissues, since all tissue samples will be collected from 
tissue that has already been removed as part of standard care. When feasible, tissue adequate 
2013- [ADDRESS_313387]  19, 2015  
Page 11  
 
for preparation of 50 slides (5 mm thick) will be stored from each collection. In brief, the 
objectives of this protocol are to:  
1. To collect and store, both prospectively and retrospectively, tissue, blood, body fluids 
and information for the sole purpose of banking pre- malignant and malignant lesions of 
the gastrointestinal tract. An IRB approved I nformed Consent  in standard format is on 
file with the IRB.  
2. To collect, store, and analyze, both prospect ively and retrospectively, data on disease 
characterization, treatment and outcomes for patients with suspected premalignant and 
malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal  tract at the University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson 
Cancer Center (UTMDACC).  
3. To collect, store, and analyze data on patients with gastrointestinal malignancies  of the 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) from patients’ primary 
physicians or other treatment centers prior to, during and after the patients’ visits at 
UTMDACC.  
4. To collect, store or discard residual tissue, blood and other body fluids obtained during 
the performance of research activities for which consent and authorization have been 
obtained from the participant.  
 
 
5.0 ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
Investigators are required to report to the MD Anderson IRB ALL serious treatment emergent 
adverse event (STEAE) as soon as possible. The methods for collecting safety data are 
described below.  
Adverse Events 
1. Definitions  
The definitions of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and other significant 
adverse events (OAEs) are given below.  It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved in 
the study is familiar with the content of this section.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_257965].  
2. Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration 
of a pre- existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), or signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver).  In 
clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, 
includin g run -in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.   
3. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
2013- [ADDRESS_313388]  19, 2015  
Page 12  
 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run- in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), and at any dose of the investigati onal product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is immediately life -threatening  
c. Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
e. Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect in the offspring of the subject  
f. Is an important medical even that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening, or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54068]. These 
should also usually be considered serious.  
 
The causality of SAEs (i.e., their relationship to study treatment) will be assessed by [CONTACT_167167](s), who in completing the relevant case report form must answer “yes” or “no” to 
the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_33641]?”   
 
4. Other Significant Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs will b e identified by [CONTACT_257977].  Significant 
adverse events of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the subject from study treatment, will be classified as OAEs.  Examples of 
these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that 
lead to intervention (other than those already classi fied as serious), dose reduction or 
significant additional treatment.  For each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the 
Clinical Study Report.  
Recording of Adverse Events:  
Any detrimental change in a subject’s condition, subsequent to the subject entering the study 
should be considered an AE. AE reporting will be performing using CTCAE version 4.0.  
Method of detecting AE/SAE:  
At each visit the method of detecting AE and SAEs in this study will be by:  
1. Information volunteered by [CONTACT_423], or caregiver  
2013- [ADDRESS_313389] at every visit such as the 
following: How are you feeling? Have you had any (other) medical problems since your 
last visit  
3. Observation by [CONTACT_51857], other care providers or  relatives  
 
6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
For the futility monitoring of overall survival (OS), we have assumed a median OS of 11 
months for historical treatment and a median of 15 months (i.e., 4 months improvement) with 
the experimental therapy based on the preliminary data (Appendix C). For tox icity monitoring, 
we have assumed that 30% or higher rate of toxicity is intolerable.  
 
This is a single arm phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion for gastric carcinomatosis or positive cytology. 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the overall survival (OS) in subjects with stage 
IV gastric cancer representing positive cytology or imaging occult carcinomatosis after 
laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy admi nistration.  
 
The study will be continuously monitored for the primary endpoint, OS, using the method of 
Thall, Wooten, and Tannir.2  It is assumed that the OS for each patient is exponentially 
distributed with a median of λE among patients who receive the experimental treatment and a 
median of λ H for the historical treatment.   Further, λH was assumed to follow an inverse 
gamma distribution, i.e., λH ~ IG(60, 649),  which has a mean of  [ADDRESS_313390] the little prior knowledge of λE we assumed an inverse gamma prior distribution 
with the same mean of 11 months and a much larger variance of 121, i.e., λE ~ IG(3, 22).  The 
trial will be stopped early if Pr( λE  > λH +δdata) < pL, where δ = [ADDRESS_313391]=0.[ADDRESS_313392] (CTC) website 
(https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct/) maintained by [CONTACT_257978].  
 
The operating characteristics of the design, based on an overall assumed accrual rate of 1 -2 
patient s per month with 5000 simulated trials per scenario, are given in the following table:

For the purpose of monitoring, toxicity is defined as > 30% Grade III or Grade IV toxicities 
occurring during the HIPEC  and within 14 days after the HIPEC, as defined by [CONTACT_257979] v4.0. The toxicity will be monitored using the method 
of Thall, Simon, and Estey.11, 12  Following are the rules for the monitoring of toxicities for the 
experimental treatment: the probability of toxicity is denoted by [CONTACT_153056]. We assume PE ~ beta 
(0.6, 1.4).  Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_83724]: Pr(PE > 0.30 | 
data)>0.95. That is, we will stop the study if, at any time during the study, we determine that 
there is more than 95% chance that the toxicity rate is more than 30%. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257966], based on these assumpti ons and monitoring conditions are found in 
table “Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_195442]”. We will apply these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257967] 3rd patient and then in cohorts of 3. For example, accrual will cease if [ADDRESS_313394] 6 patients treated. The operating characteristics are 
summarized in “Operating characteristics for Toxicity Monitoring”. Both the decision rule and 
operating characteristics were calculated using the stopbound procedure in Stata version 12.1.

Statistical Analysis:  
All patients who received treatment will be included in the analysis for efficacy and safety.  
Demographic/clinical characteristics and safety data of the patients will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and  range. Resection rates will 
be presented with 95% confidence intervals. The association between resection rates and 
patient’s clinical characteristics will be examined by [CONTACT_195463]’s rank sum test or Fisher’s exact 
2013- [ADDRESS_313397]. Overall survival time will be estim ated using the Kaplan- Meier method. Patients who drop 
out of the study will be included in the time to event data as “censored data”.  The two- sided 
log-rank test will be used to assess the differences of time to events between groups.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_313398] (IRB) may perform audits or 
inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of such an audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization (IC H), and any applicable regulatory requirements.

also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any  time. The subject should 
be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided. The subject’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before 
conducting any procedure specifically for the study.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_30015], signed Written Informed Consent Form in the 
subject’s medical record as well as his/her study subject file.  A copy of the signed Written 
Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject. The consent process wi ll be documented 
in the subject’s medical records.  
Subject Data Protection:  
The Written Informed Consent Form will explain that for data verification purposes, a regulatory 
authority, and the IRB may require direct access to parts of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257973], including subjects’ medical history.  
12.0 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES  
Procedures in Case of Medical Emergency:  
The principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are 
available to handle medic al emergencies during the study.  
Procedures in Case of Overdose:  
There is currently no known antidote for the systemic chemotherapy in this study .  The 
treatment of AEs associated with overdose should be supportive for the underlying adverse 
symptoms.  
Dose s of study treatment in excess of that specified in the clinical study protocol are 
considered to be an overdose. Overdose, with or without associated symptoms should be 
handled in the same way as a deviation and sent to IRB.  Signs or symptoms of an overdose 
that meet the criteria of serious should be reported as a SAE in the appropriate timeframes and 
be documented as cl inical sequelae to an overdose.

Project title  
Ketone Monitoring in T1D:  Effect of SGLT2i during Usual Care and with Insulin 
Deficiency  
 
Project description  
 
Rationale  
Type 1 diabetes (T1D)  continue s to increase in incidence and in prevalence due to improved acute and 
chronic disease management.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_686670] 20 years in short and long -acting 
insulins, in insulin administration through pen devices and insulin pumps, and more rec ently the addition 
of continuous glucose monitoring systems, glucose control has not improved substantially in persons with 
T1D.1  Consequently, the battle to reduce th e incidence  of long term complications such as diabetic 
nephropathy in persons with T1D has not been won.  The risk of microvascular complications, particularly 
kidney disease, is strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease in T1D.2  Both need 
improved prevention and treatment strategies.   
 
Sodium -glucose cotransport2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been irrefutably proven to reduce progression of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_686671] 2 diabetes.3–[ADDRESS_930884], the results show such significant benefits that SGLT2 i are now recommended by [CONTACT_686723] (a nd in 
some cases without) type [ADDRESS_930885] been conducted in T1D for purposes of gaining regulatory approval for use in this population for glucose lowering and amelioration of weight gain and in some cases reduction of hypoglycemia.
7–14  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_45901] l trials for glucose lowering are  typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 24 – 26 weeks in 
length, with safety studies lasting 1 – [ADDRESS_930886] been conducted in adults with T1D, 
commonly with HbA1c levels greater than 7 – 7.5%.  Most of the clinical programs in T1D have included 
two trials, so for each of the four SGLT2i (canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin and sotagliflozin), 
hundreds to more than a thousand persons with T1D have been included with more than half taking the active SGLT2i.  With one exception of low dose empagliflozin (2.5 mg, a dose not otherwise available),
15  
there has been a consistent signal o f increased occurrence of ketosis -related  adverse events, including 
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).16  In general, the incidence of DKA in the SGLT2i groups is 2 – 3X the 
incidence in the placebo groups.[ADDRESS_930887] clinicians to be unacceptable, and thus persons with T1D are not able to benefit from the reduction in cardiovascular and kidney out comes afforded by [CONTACT_170149].  
Applicant ( McGill, Janet B): 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_930888] eluded clinical measurement, such as blood 
acetoacetate (AcAc) and acetone.  Acetone is highly volatile and is excreted primarily through the lung , 
as shown below .  The rapid breathing that occurs in T1D persons in DKA is an attempt to excrete acetone 
and reduce the level of circulating ketones.19  Acetone diffusion and excretion can be measured in 
exhaled air, ideally from alveolar spaces at the end of exhalation.  Prior work has shown that there is a 
linear relationship between breath acetone  (BrACE) and plasma acetone20 and between BrACE and beta 
hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) such that BrACE could be used in risk prediction model for diabetic 
ketoacidosis.21  A study that compared BrAce with blood BOHB in non- diabetic persons showed a 
relatively weak correlation, R=0.57, however the ROC analysis confirmed that BrAce can identify levels of 
ketosis that would be actionable to a person with T1D.22   BrACE is susceptible to interferences from 
foods, alcohol and environ mental volatile organic compounds  (VOC) such as hand sanitiizers, cleansers 
and nail polish remover, which needs consideration during home use.23   
 
There is still quite a lot to learn about the relationship between BrAce and BOHB levels , particularly in 
persons with T1D, who are at risk of ketosis and DKA.  Is there a correlation between BrAce and BOHB in 
persons with fluctuating glucose and insuli n levels, characteristic of T1D?  Can measuring BrAce identify 
actionable levels of ketones with or without a strong correlation with BOHB?  Do elevated ketones always 
occur in the setting of elevated blood glucose, or is there a risk of ketogenesis with l ow glucose such as 
when fasting?24  Monitoring of “ketone status” which is to say, identifying ketone levels that rise to 
actionable levels prior to the development of classic symptoms of ketosis, is now considered urgent.   
 
 
 Herring et al. propose that the increase in BOHB with the SGLT2i dapagliflozin is due to multiple factors, 
including increased lipolysis, reduced renal excretion, reduced uptake of BOHB by [CONTACT_686724] 
a metabolic switch to ketogenesis in the liver.
25  Ferrannini et al found that in persons with type 2 
diabetes (T2D), the increase in BOHB se condary to SGLT2i was due to overproduction of ketones.26   
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with blood glucose that is lower than expected, known as euglycemic DKA, is 
now a recognized risk in persons with T2D who take SGLT2i.27  A similar phenomenon can occur in T1D.    
 
We propose a study that includes both real world testing at home, and testing during insulin deficiency 
that is patterned after the studies by [CONTACT_686725] .25,28   The study purpose, which is to 
Applicant ( McGill, Janet B): 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_930889] wheth er measurement of BrAce , currently used to support persons on a ketogenic d iet, can be re -
purposed for ketone tracking in persons with T1D.  The choice of the B iosense®  (Readout) breath ketone 
analyzer (B KA) was predicated on its designation as a Class 1 device by [CONTACT_8415].  In the prior clinical trial in 
non-diabetic persons, both BrAce and blood BOHB were found to vary widely throughout the day.22  
Multiple factors are known to create variability in ketone production and excretion in breath, including 
fasting, restriction in carbohydrate intake and exercise.  Other factors at play may be cross contamination 
with other VOC such as alcohol, hand sanitizer, etc.  The Biosense® BKA to be used in this study will 
have a filter to reduce the effects of competing substances  during the on- site visits with insulin deficiency 
to mitigate this problem under controlled circumstances .   
 
This proposed study of [ADDRESS_930890] segments that include routine testing of ketones during usual care, 
during insulin d eficiency,  and while taking a  SGLT2i in addition to usual care, then with insulin deficiency 
after the SGLT2i has reached  steady state  and ingested that morning.  We will study 20 adults with 
T1D who are using Dexcom G6  continuous glucose monitor (CGM), plus any form of insulin delivery.  
Study participants will be randomized to Group A or Group B as shown below  in Figure 1.  Simultaneous 
ketone monitoring using a the Biosense ® BKA and capi[INVESTIGATOR_686672] 2- 3X 
daily for 2 weeks during each of the outpatient segments.  This will generate > [ADDRESS_930891] on the Washington University Intensive 
Research Unit (IRU), frequent monitoring with capi[INVESTIGATOR_686673] (Precision Xtra ®, 
Abbott) wil l be compared with breath BrAce  measurements (Biosense ®, Readout) and laboratory 
measurements of BOHB and acetoacetate.  Ele ctrolytes and glucose  will also be measured .   
The schematic is shown below:   
 
 
         
  
  
 Figure 1.  Study plan and study groups.   
 
The goals of the study are to better understand ketone fluctuations in persons with T1D during usual 
care and when taking a SGLT2i in addition to usual care through frequent ketone monitoring.  Additional 
information about usability of the breath ketone analyzer will be tested with simple questions using a 
Likert scale and a structured interview  at the end of the study.  The question is not whether the ketone 
measurements correlate perfectly with t he go ld standard BOHB measurements, but whether breath 
ketone measurements by [CONTACT_686726] “ketone status” 
and identify states of rising  ketones early enough for mitigation strategies to work.16   The potential 
advantage s of using a breath analyzer are  that it is non- invasive ; it is easy to use repeatedly without 
additional cost or pain from fingersticks, and it may be sufficiently informative  to employ a ketone action 
plan before ketones rise to hazardous levels .     
 
The long term goals of this study extend beyond the completion of the study to the development of DKA 
mitigation strategies that are manageable and accepted by [CONTACT_1962].  A ketone mitigation strategy must

previously tested in persons with T1D.   
 
 
Objective(s)  
 The objectives of this study are several, and the following hypotheses will be tested:  
1. Ketone generation in persons with T1D can be identified by [CONTACT_686727][INVESTIGATOR_686674] -
hydroxybutyrate or breath acetone using a breath ketone analyzer during insulin deficiency, and 
the values will show a significant correlation.   
2. Breath ketone measurements  tested during usual care will correlate with capi[INVESTIGATOR_686675] -hydroxybutyrate.   
3. SGLT2i use will increase blood and breath ketones in persons with T1D during insulin deficiency, 
and simultaneous measurements of blood beta -hydroxybutyrat e and breath acetone will show a 
significant correlation.   
4. Breath ketone measurements tested during 2- weeks of SGLT2i therapy will correlate with 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_686676] -hydroxybutyrate.   
5. Patients will be able to identify epi[INVESTIGATOR_686677]2i therapy prospectively, before symptoms of ketosis occur, with the breath ketone 
analyzer .  
6. Use of the breath ketone analyzer will be accepted by [CONTACT_374272] T1D for routine and 
symptomatic monitoring of ketone levels  such that mitigation strategies can be employed before 
elevations in ketones become severe.   
 
Methodology  
Research Design  
 
This study is a single -center, investigator- designed and led clinical trial testing the efficacy of the breath 
ketone a nalyzer, Biosense, for the detection of ketogenesis during four distinct study periods, which will 
allow comparisons of the Biosense measured breath ketones with capi[INVESTIGATOR_686678] (POC) tests with laboratory measured BOHB and a cetoacetate (AcAc).  Ethics approval will be 
from the Washington University Human Studies Protection Office, and obtained prior to contact [CONTACT_686728].  Participants with T1D using a stable form of insulin delivery, either insulin pump o r 
multiple daily injections (MDI) and will perform paired measurements of capi[INVESTIGATOR_686679] a  SGLT2i.  Paired testing will then be done  during insulin 
withdrawal in usual care and insulin withdrawal while taking a SGLT2i that has reached steady state.  
 Participants will be randomized to Group A, in which the usual care segment and insulin withdrawal day is done first followed by [CONTACT_686729]2i and insulin withdrawal with SGLT2i or Group B , in which 
the SGLT2i will be taken during usual care for [ADDRESS_930893] , and will 
allow more than 800 paired measuremen ts of breath ketones with capi[INVESTIGATOR_686680], 
more than 800 paired measurements during usual care plus SGLT2i therapy.  Additionally, due to 
concerns about ketogenesis during times of insulin deficiency, and the demonstrated increase in ketone generation with SGLT2i therapy, the pair -wise comparisons will be informative about the correlation of 
BrACE  as measured with the Biosense device with POC and laboratory BOHB measurements and 
laboratory measured AcAc.

Page [ADDRESS_930905].  The prescreening 
study staff will explain the study purpose, study activities , study expectations and the risks and benefits  
of participation. The informed consent will sent via email  with the patient’s permission to use email 
communication.  A second discussion may take place by [CONTACT_686731] n at the screening visit to 
answer questions about information provided in the informed consent document , study procedures and 
risks and benefits .    
 VISIT [ADDRESS_930906] 3 days .  If participant is on MDI 
therapy taking basal insulin in the evening and/or uses other than glargine as basal ins ulin, study 
physician will adjust delivery time to morning and/or make changes to basal insulin glargine for at 
minimum 48 hours prior to visits 2 and 3. History of alcohol use, smoking (including marijuana) and any 
CNS depressants (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_45156], pain me dications ) will be reviewed , and may be a cause for investigator 
recommended non- participation if paired testing cannot be completed without interferences .  Women 
with child -bearing potential must be using acceptable birth control (barrier, hormonal, IUD, confirmed 
abstinence  or surgical ) during the study and must consent to pregnancy testing at specified intervals.  
Breast -feeding is a cause for exclusion from the study. Vital signs, height, weight and HbA1c will be 
obtained.  An optional BMP and/or CBC may be done if evaluation of kidney function or red blood cell 
count is determined to be important to meet eligibility criteria.  All data will be entered into a dedicated 
Redcap database.    
 
After the investigator or sub -investigator determines that the pa rticipant meets all of the inclusion and 
none of the exclusion criteria, the study team will proceed with interrogation of the participant’s CGM to 
ensure appropriate connectivity with the study team.  Participants will be asked to demonstrate 
competency i n making cha nges to insulin pump settings.  The study team members will train the 
participant in the use of the Precision Xtra ketone meter and the Biosense BKA.  Participants will be 
instructed to wait 60 minutes after eating, smoking/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], drinking sod as or flavored waters or 
consuming items such as toothpaste, mouthwash, cough drops, breath mints, chewing gum, lip balm and artificial sweeteners before doing a BrACE measurement.  If using alcohol, participants should wait [ADDRESS_930907] run will be 
conducted.  A diary will be provided for entry of BOHB ketone measurements and BrAce  with space for 
comments in case of known interference with BrAce or other problems with measurements.   A written 
ketone action plan will be provided to all participants in the study.  Participants will be informed that they 
may stop participating in the study at any time without loss of usual care of their diabetes.   
 A ketone action plan w ill be provided to each participant that will include the following elements:  
ingestion of carbohydrates, fluid intake and insulin administration with doses of insulin adjusted according to individual requirements.
16,17  Participants will be asked to employ the ketone action plan if BOHB  
reading is >1.5 mmol/L.  BrACE levels of >15 in the absence of corresponding BOHB level >1.5 mmol will 
be considered due to contamination and the participant will be asked to repeat the levels in 1 – [ADDRESS_930908] draw in l ots of 4 to Group A or Group B

USUAL CARE  (Group A will do this first, Group B will do this segment after the SGLT2i)  
The participant will manage his or her diabetes in the usual way, with no effort to modula te glucose 
levels for the study.  Participant s will check breath ketones with the Biosense BKA and capi[INVESTIGATOR_686689], plus any 
optional measurements .  See instructions above for avoidance of biologic or enviro nmental contaminants.   
There is no mandated contact [CONTACT_6635], but participants can contact [CONTACT_686732], to report device issues or discuss glucose or ketone levels .    
 
On-site Visit  
The on -site will be conducted a t the Intensive Research Unit at Washington University.  Patients will be 
asked to arrive fasting, to stop their basal insulin delivery 1 hour before arrival at the center if on an 
insulin pump or to hold injectable insulin doses.  Prior to leaving home, t he participant’s blood glucose 
should be 90 – 250 mg/dL, and BOHB <1.5 mmol/L, or the test day will be rescheduled.  Time of the last 
insulin dose will be recorded.  Vital signs and baseline labs including a CBC, BMP and pregnancy test in women with child -bearing potential will be done.  Measurements of capi[INVESTIGATOR_686690] X7 or 8 if the patient remains relatively 
asymptomatic, and the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686691] 4 mmol/ L.  If the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686692]

hour intervals.  Venous blood samples for BMP, BOHB and AcAc * will be drawn at baseline and every 2 
hours X 3 plus the end of the study.   
 
The insulin withdrawal portion of the study will end (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]) upon patient request for any reason, if the patient becomes symp tomatic with nausea or vomiting (even if he or she does not request that the 
study be stopped), after 7 hours of fasting without insulin, or if either the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686695] >4 mmol/L or 
the CGM blood glucose is >400 mg/dL.  BMP will be done every [ADDRESS_930909], with 
photographic proof that it is negative before starting dapagliflozin.   
 
The ketone action plan will be discussed again with each participant .  Elements of the plan will during

will be asked to employ the ketone action plan if BOHB reading is >1.5 mmol/L.  BrACE levels of >15 in 
the absence of corresponding BOHB level >1.5 mmol will be considered due to contamination and the 
participant will be asked to repeat the levels in 1 – 2 hours.   Participants will be given numbers of study 
personnel to call for ongoi ng advice about management of ketosis.   
 
USUAL CARE + SGLT2i (Group B will do this segment first, followed by [CONTACT_686733]2i)  
The participant will commence taking dapagliflozin, 10 mg daily, for 14 days before Visit 3.  Insulin doses 
will be re duced by 10% basal and 15% bolus.  Insulin dose adjustments will be determined by [CONTACT_686734] 2.  Participants will check BrACE  with the Biosense BKA and capi[INVESTIGATOR_686697].  Each time 
point should be at least 4 hours after ingesting alcohol.  Participants will be instructed in avoidance of contamination with other alcohol sources such as swabs, nail polish remover, hand sanitizer and other 
Applicant ( McGill, Janet B): 
 
 
Page 11 of 18 solvents during the testing period.  The study team will remotely monitor the participant’s glucose within 
a few days of starting the SGLT2i  and again prior to the on -site visit to ensure safety.  There is no 
mandated contact [CONTACT_6635], but particip ants can contact [CONTACT_686735].    
 
On-site visit, SGLT2i  
The on -site visit with SGLT2i will be conducted at the Intensive Research Unit at Washington University, 
the same format as described for usual care .  Patients will be asked to arrive fasting, to stop their basal 
insulin delivery 1 hour before arrival at the center if on an insulin pump or to hold injectable insulin doses.  Prior to leaving home, the participant’s blood glucose should be 90 – 250 mg/dL, and BOHB <1.5 
mmol/L, or the test day will be rescheduled. Time of the last insulin dose will be recorded.  Patients will 
be given a dose of dapagliflozin, [ADDRESS_930910] in women with child -bearing potential will be done.  Measurements of 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_686698] X7 if the patient remains relatively asymptomatic, and the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686691] 4 
mmol/L. If the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686692] 2.5 mmol/L or capi[INVESTIGATOR_686693] 250 mg/dL, the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686699] 30 minute intervals. The venous blood samples will continue to be collected on the hour intervals.   Venous blood samples for BMP, BOHB and 
AcAc* will be drawn at baseline and every 2 hours X3 plus the end of the study.   
 
The insulin withdrawal portion of the study will end (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]) upon patient request for any reason, 
if the patient become s symptomatic with nausea or vomiting (even if he or she does not request that the 
study be stopped), after 7 hours of fasting without insulin, or if either the capi[INVESTIGATOR_686695] >4 mmol/L or 
the CGM blood glucose is >400 mg/dL.  BMP will be done every [ADDRESS_930911] made with t he patient for safety.   
 
*Acetoacetate (AcAc) has been rarely measured in studies of ketone metabolism due to lack of a reliable 
assay, stability of the analyte and high cost.   A plate -based nonenzymatic spectrophotometric assay is 
now available, but it is new to the WU Core Laboratory.[ADDRESS_930912] of the assay .  This will 
be reflected in the informed consent.    
 
 
Sample Size  
 
The sample size is based on the study by [CONTACT_686736]., which documented wide variability in ketone 
measurements during the day in persons undergoing dietary modification to enhance ketogenesis , also in 
the control group .  In that study of 21 participants, over 1000 paired measurements were generated to 
determine the correlation between BrAce with BOHB using the Precision X tra ketone meter, providing R2 
=0.57.  Further analysis demonstrated receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC >0.80 for values 
of BOHB at the 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM thresholds.  This study will generate ~1400 paired measurements, 
which are expected to be in the same range during usual care and usual care plus SGLT2i.  Since the 
main objective of the study is to determine whether the Biosense BKA provides sufficient information for 
the patient to consider action steps to avoid worsening ketosis, the ROC an alysis is crucial and  the 
Applicant ( McGill, Janet B): 
 
 
Page 12 of 18 number of observations needed is expected to be about 1000.  For the insulin withdrawal studies, a 
difference of BOHB levels of 1.0 mmol/L between usual care and usual care plus dapagliflozin, a sample 
size of 16 completing both s tudy days can be detected with 80% power and two sided significance level 
of 5%.    
 
Data Management and Analysis  
 
Participants will be assigned a randomly generated patient ID number, not in order of participation.  All 
data will be entered into a dedicat ed Redcap database without patient identifiers for analysis.  Baseline 
cohort information will include demographic information, diabetes duration, history of last DKA epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 
complications, eGFR and insulin doses during usual care and at the end of the us ual care + SGLT2i 
therapy.  Glucose parameters, including time in range, time above and below range will be recorded at 
the end of each 2- week segments  from CGM downloads during the usual care and usual care + SGLT2i 
study segments .  Capi[INVESTIGATOR_686700], and only those taken 
within a 1 hour window will be entered as data during the usual care  and usual care + SGLT2i  (study 
segments 1 and 2) .  Data entry for on -site insulin- withdrawal visits will include patient vitals and weight, 
all laboratory values, hourly paired capi[INVESTIGATOR_686701].  
Adverse events during the study will be manually tabulated.   
 
The study will be monitored  for data integerity by [CONTACT_686737] , omissions  and to generate a report to the DSMB.   
 
Data analysis will be done using SAS through either the WU CTSA Statistics center or a faculty member in 
the division with SAS capability.    
 
 
Assessment of Efficacy  
 The main efficacy parameter will be the correlation between BrAce levels and capi[INVESTIGATOR_686702] 1 and 2, usual care and usual care + SGLT2i of the study using linear regression.  
Efficacy will be established with R
2 >0.6. S eparate linear regressions  will determine the correlation of 
BrAce level s with capi[INVESTIGATOR_17276] B OHB, of  BrAce levels and laboratory BOHB, and of BrAce levels and 
AcAc.  Efficacy of BrAce for correctly indicating actionable ketosis will be establ ished with R2 >0.6.  
Additionally, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis will be performed to clarify the diagnostic ability of BrAce compared to capi[INVESTIGATOR_686703] a person with T1D, or >1.5 mmol/L.     
 
Qualitative analysis will be undertaken based on a simple Likert scale questionnaire with the following 
questions rated from 1 to 5:  
• Did testing breath ketones help you to understand your “ketone stat us”? 
• Were you able to identify epi[INVESTIGATOR_686704]?   
• Are you likely to continue to use the Biosense breath ketone analyzer for this purpose ?  
 The main efficacy parameter will be assessed with an interim analysis after completion of 12 subjects in 
the trial, with results reported to the DSMB and to the funding partner, JDRF.  Adverse events will be 
manually tabulated and reported.   
 
Assessment of Safety  
 Safety parameters will be analyzed separately for the us ual care segments and for the insulin withdrawal 
days.  For the usual care segment , the main safety concern is a level of capi[INVESTIGATOR_686705] >1.5 
mmol/L at any time.  P articipants  will be asked to call the study coordinator or investiga tor for advice if 
this happens , and to start a ketone action plan.  The participant can call for concerns  about any level of 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_686706], but in particular while taking an SGLT2i.  T he participant  will be 
Applicant ( McGill, Janet B): 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_930913] every 1 – 2 hours until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378].  Any capi[INVESTIGATOR_686707] >1.5 mmol/L will be 
report ed as an event  of special interest, with follow -up ketone action plan results noted .  BrACE levels of 
>15 without corresponding BOHB level >1.0 mmol/L will be considered likely due to contamination and 
repeated in 1 hour.   Likewise, any severe hypoglycemia event will be  report ed as an adverse event. 
Patients with level 2 hypoglycemia, glucoses <54 mg/dL for more then 1% of the day on weekly CGM 
reviews will have insulin doses adjusted and a dis cussion with the investigator.  
 
The most important sa fety parameter of the insulin withdrawal test days will be capi[INVESTIGATOR_686708] >3 mmol/L, or symptoms of nausea or vomiting at any level of BOHB.  Capi[INVESTIGATOR_686709] >3 mmol/L constitutes a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_686710], and immediate treatment with 
fluids, insulin and carbohydrates will be commenced, and the patient followed on-site until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_438121].  Resolution will be defined as cessation  of symptoms and capi[INVESTIGATOR_686711] <1.0 mmol/L, 
with blood glucose <250 mg /dL.  Note that in a similar study of insulin withdrawal before and after 
treatment with the SGLT2i, canagliflozin, it took about 6 hours for glucose to increase from 100 to 300 
mg/dl (pre -treatment) and from 100 to 220 mg/dL with canagliflozin.
28 During the six hours, BOHB 
increased from 0.2 to 1 .2 mmol/L (pre -treatment) and from 0.4 to 1.5 mmol/L with canagliflozin.[ADDRESS_930914] be 
tested for normality using the D’Agostino -Pearson omnibus K2 test. If both capi[INVESTIGATOR_686705] d ata and 
BrACE data are normally distributed, then the Pearson r will be calculated. Otherwise, the Spearman ρ 
will be calculated. A correlation coefficient > 0.7 will be interpreted as strong.  Similar correlation 
procedures will be carried out to analyze the relationships between: 1) capi[INVESTIGATOR_686712] 2- week SGLT2i -treatment period of the study; 2) capi[INVESTIGATOR_686713]; 3) venous blood BOHB and BrACE level during insulin 
withdrawal; 4) venous blood AcAc and BrACE level during insulin withdrawal; 5) venous blood BOHB and 
venous blood AcAc during insulin withdrawal.   
 
The relationship between time from insulin withdrawal and: 1) capi[INVESTIGATOR_686705], 2) BrACE, and 3) 
venous blood BOHB will be modeled by [CONTACT_171462] -squares linear regression. T he slopes of these [ADDRESS_930915]. A receiver- operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve will be generated to describe the ability of BrACE to identify clinically actionable ketonemia, defined 
as capi[INVESTIGATOR_686705] > 1.5 mmol/L, by [CONTACT_686738][INVESTIGATOR_686714]. Separate curves will be generated 
during the segment s with and without SGLT2i treatment.  
 The effect of SGLT2i on random BrACE and random capi[INVESTIGATOR_686715] 2- week free -living 
period will be assessed using unpaired two -tailed Student’s 
t-tests. The effect of SGLT2i on 1) frequency 
of random capi[INVESTIGATOR_686705] > 1.5 mmol/L during the 2- week free -living period, and 2) frequency of 
venous blood BOHB > 1.5 mmol/L during the insulin withdrawal study, will be assessed using Fisher’s 
exact test. The effect of SGLT2i on the correlation between BrACE and BOHB during the 2- week free -
living period, and the effec t of SGLT2i on the slope and y- intercept of the best -fit line relating time from

compare linear regression models.  
 
Baseline participant characteristics, laboratory results, CGM glucose metrics, and Likert scale values 
regarding breath ketone meter usage will be reported as mean ± SD.  
Statistical analyses will be performed using GraphPad Prism 9.   Interim analyses of these ou tcomes will 
be performed after [ADDRESS_930917] completed the study protocol.  
    
 
Ethical considerations  
 
This study will be submitted to the Washington University Human Research Protection Office  (HRPO), 
which is the institutional review board  for ethics review and approval .  The informed consent will carefully 
detail the previously described risks to  persons with T1D taking a SGLT2i .  The risks of insulin withdrawal 
including hyperglycemia and the development of mild ketosis will be described, along with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_686716].  A written informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_686739], will be used in the study, and consent obtained prior to any study procedure being performed.  
Ethics concerns for this study include:  
• Loss of confidentia lity is a risk with this clinical study.  This risk will be handled by [CONTACT_686740] -identification of data.  All research personnel have been 
trained in confidentiality measures and good clinical practice.   
• Loss of time while performing study -related procedures , both  over 4 weeks of ketone monitoring 
while at home, and on- site study visits .  There is no mitigation strategy for this risk, but 
communication about time commitments and scheduling concerns will be handled both ve rbally 
and in writing in the informed consent.   
• Hyperglycemia and development of ketones will occur during on- site study visit days due to 
insulin withdrawal.  This could result in symptoms of feeling unwell, nausea or vomiting.   This is 
a clearly identi fiable risk.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_686717].  An investigator will either be 
present at the end of the visit or be in close proximity for consultation.   
• Adverse effects of dapagliflozin will be described.  Mitigation strategies will be offered  (such as 
treatment of genital infections), and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_686718].   
• Hyperglycemia from insulin dose reduction while starting dapagliflozin or hypoglycemia due to 
insufficient insulin dose reduction can occur.  Both of these risks will be explained at the beginning of the study and at the start of the SGLT2i treatment.  Mitigation strategies include daily assessment of glucoses by [CONTACT_686741]-hyperglylcemic treatment.   
 A local data safety and monitoring committee composed of two faculty clinicians familiar with SGLT2i 
therapy plus a statistician or three clinicians if one has a background in stat istics will be convened.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_686719].  An interim analysis will be conducted after completion of 12 subjects to review efficacy and safety.  Adverse events will be collated a nd reported.  The DSMB report will be made available to the HRPO and to JDRF.

10Jan2023 – Updated stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_686722] -site visits: blood ketone ≥ 4mmol/L or glucose ≥ 
400 mg/dL. This does not present an increase in risk/benefit for particip ants. Finger sticks 
for glucose/ketone monitoring may be collected every 30 minutes to 1 hour for the duration 
of the study.

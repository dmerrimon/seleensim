[ADDRESS_1134072] s with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.  One such treatment modality is 
stereotactic body irradiation (SBRT).  SBRT has been shown to af ford good local control 
and acceptable safety when utilized in subject s with locally advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma.  We propose to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_818880] a bridging strategy for subject s with hepatocellular carci noma undergoing 
orthotopic liver transplantation.   The preliminary data obtained from this trial will help 
inform the design and sample size calculations for subsequent, multi -site trials.  
 
B.  SPECIFIC AIMS  
Hypothesis:  SBRT will be associated with longer time intervals between initial treatment 
and the need for retreatment, compared to  TACE , as a “bridge” to orthotopic liver 
transplantation in subject s with hepatocellular carcinoma.

C.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer with an increasing 
incidence worldwide, and is the third leading cause of cancer -related death ( 1-5). Given 
that most people who develop hepatocel lular carcinoma have concomitant cirrhosis, the 
best opportunity for cure for many remains liver transplantation.  Because cadaveric liver 
transplants are in short supply  in the [LOCATION_002] , subject s who are eligible for l iver 
transplantation frequently  can wait a year or longer before a transplantation .  Recently, 
local regional interventions have been utilized as a temporizing strategy to "bridge" 
individuals waiting for transplantation.  The aims of bridging treatments include; 
decreasing the waiting l ist drop out rate for transplantation; reducing recurrent 
hepatocellular carcinoma after transplantation; and improving post transplant overall 
4 
Amendment  18 September  2017 version 7.0  
 survival (6). For subject s undergoing local regional therapy as a bridge to transplantation, 
(TACE) is the most commonly utilized treatment (7).  
 
TACE is a therapy that combines the local delivery of chemotherapy with the induction 
of tumor ischemia through obstruction of the feeding vessels. Recently two randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), conducted in Europe and Asia, showed an increased survival for 
subject s treated by [CONTACT_818891] a chemotherapy agent and iodized 
oil when compared to conservative treatment. Llovet et al. reported 1 and 2 year survival 
probabilities of 82 and 63%, respectively . Lo et al. found significant improvement in 
survival for Asian HCC subject s treated by [CONTACT_818892] (8 ,9). The Drug -Eluting 
Bead (DEB) is a novel agent for chemoembolization with a unique availability to load 
doxorubicin. In vitro data has shown a sl ow release of doxorubicin over time with a 
decreased systemic blood serum level and an increased tumor tissue level of the 
chemotherapeutic agent (10 -13).  
 
Several pi[INVESTIGATOR_818881]. Poon et al 
showed good tum or response and limited toxicity in subject s with incurable HCC and 
Child -Pugh class A cirrhosis. No dose -limiting toxicity was observed for up to 150 mg 
doxorubicin. The pharmacokinetic study showed a low peak plasma doxorubicin 
concentration and no syste mic toxicity was observed. The treatment -related complication 
rate was 11.4%. There was no treatment -related death. Among [ADDRESS_1134073] s who 
completed 2 courses of TACE, the partial response rate and the complete response rates 
were 50 and 0%, respectively, b y response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 
criteria at computerized tomography scan [ADDRESS_1134074] criteria, taking into account the extent of tumor necrosis, 19 (63.3%) subject s 
had a partial response and 2 (6.7%) had a complete response (14). Varela et al evaluated 
the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TACE using drug eluting beads (DEB). 
DEB -TACE was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Two cases developed 
liver abscess, one leading to d eath. Response rate was 75% (66.6% on intention -to-treat). 
Doxorubicin Cmax and AUC were significantly lower in DEB -TACE subject s than in 
conventional TACE. After a median follow -up of 27.6 months, 1 - and 2 -year survival is 
92.5 and 88.9%, respectively (15 ). 
 
Malagari et al conducted an open -label, single -center, single -arm study including [ADDRESS_1134075] s with documented single unresectable HCC. Mean tumor diameter was 
5.6 cm (range, 3 -9 cm) classified as Okuda stages 1 (n=53) and 2 (n=9). Subject s 
received repeat embolizations with doxorubicin -loaded beads every 3 months (maximum 
of three). The maximum doxorubicin dose was 150 mg per embolization, loaded in DC 
Beads of 100 -300 or 300 -500 m. Post -treatment, a n objective response according to the 
Europ ean Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria was observed in 59.6, 
81.8, and 70.8% across three treatments. At 9 months a complete response was seen in 
12.2% of subject s. Severe procedure -related complications were seen in 3.2% 
(cholecystitis , n=1; liver abscess, n=1). Post -embolization syndrome was observed in all 
subject s (16). Several studies have since shown that DEB -TACE not only is favorable 
compare to conventional TACE with regards to side effects but also has a better overall 
5 
Amendment  18 September  2017 version 7.0  
 outcome. Song demonstrated in the Asian population a better treatment response and 
delayed tumor progression with DEB -TACE ( 17). 
 
In a multicenter study including [ADDRESS_1134076] s (PRECISION V), use of D C 
Beads resulted in a marked and statistically significan t reduction in liver toxicity and 
drug-related adverse events compared with conventional TACE with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_818882] ( 18,19 ). Two other trials reported higher rates of tumor response and longer 
time to progression for the loaded DC Bead as compared to a bland embolic microsphere 
with similar characteristics ( 20).  As a result of these investigations, DEBDOX has been 
increasingly used as the treatment of choice is local regional therapy as preoperative 
treatment in subject s awaiting transplantation wi th HCC (21).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_818883], TACE as a bridge to liver transplantation remains of 
uncertain benefit. To date, multiple retrospective analyses suggest a benefit of pre -
operative treatment for subject s with HCC awaiting liver transplantat ion, but no data 
from prospective randomized trials are available establishing TACE as an effective 
strategy to reduce the risk of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma following transplantation 
or to improve survival (22).  In the absence of clear benefit, t here is no definitive standard 
of care and different preoperative treatment strategies are employed at different 
institutions for different individual subject s. Additionally, there has been no attempt to 
compare TACE, radiofrequency ablation, resection, or  other strategies when utilized to 
bridge subject s to liver transplantation.  
 
A new strategy for the treatment of both cancers metastatic to the liver and primary 
hepatocellular carcinoma is SBRT.  Historically, external beam radiation lacked adequate 
precision and was considered too toxic for radiation therapy to be utilized to target 
lesions within the liver.  When attempte d, external beam radiation engender ed radiation -
induced liver disease (RILD) at sufficient rates as to render treatment untenable (23 -26).  
However, over the past [ADDRESS_1134077] 
improved conformal radiation such that it has become a feasible and safe technique for 
focal treatment to the liver with RILD rates of less than or equal to 5% in ex perienced 
hands.  SBRT uses a small number of high dose fractions of highly conformal radiation 
therapy with high geometric precision and accuracy.  Retrospective studies and two 
prospective studies suggest that SBRT to the liver can be used safely for the  treatment of 
metastatic cancer with local control rates of 75% to 100% at 1 to 2 years (27).  Recently 
published data from Bujold et.al., utilizing SBRT for locally advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma, shows good effect and acceptable toxicity when compared  to historical data 
regarding  TACE or other equivalent strategies . The one year tumor control rate was 87%  
(28).  While not a direct comparison, SBRT may be as equally efficacious.  
 
SBRT offers some theoretical advantages compared to other local regional s trategies for 
the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.  First, a uniform dose of radiation is 
delivered to the entire tumor. There is no necessity of uniform blood flow which can be 
an issue with treatments directed through liver vasculature.  Se cond, no direct 
manipulation of the primary tumor is necessary.  Hence, any concerns for HCC spread 
through  needle tract dissemination such as can occur in radiofrequency a blation or other 
[ADDRESS_1134078] s undergoing TACE.  
 
In the current study, we propose to compare individualized stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) to TACE as a bridge to liver transplantation in subject s with 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  
 
D.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1134079] one of the following:  
 Biopsy proven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); or  
 A discrete hepatic t umor(s) as defined by [CONTACT_810267]  (29) criteria for 
cirrhotic  subject s, ≥2cm with arterial hypervascularity and venous or 
delayed phase washout  on CT or MRI.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_1134080] s are liver transplant candidates  (activ ely awaiting organ transplant  
per transplant services in documentation), or, potential liver transplant candidates ( at the 
discretion of the liver team and /or Principal Investigator ) advised by [CONTACT_818893].

 examination, baseline assessments of organ function and documentation of  
measurable disease (CT or MRI) parameters  chest CT or Chest X -ray ), 
weight, and   Quality of Life Questionnaires    
2.2 Laboratory evaluation per Study Calendar  
2.3 Assessment of clinical measures of severity of liver disease: The Model for  
End-Stage Live r Disease  (30) (ME LD) and the CTP classification are models 
used for the clinical assessment of subject s with liver dysfunction (Appendix 
A). Subject s with CTP classification Grade A versus Grade B appear to have 
increased sensitivity to radiation. Additio nally, in a study of subject s treated 
with SBRT for HCC or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 17% experienced 
progression from CTP Grade A to Grade B within 3 months after RT  (31, 32), 
suggesting that CTP may be a useful assessment of worsening liver functio n. 
MELD may perform even better than CTP at evaluating liver function ( 33). 
We propose to record these clinical measures (MELD and CTP), and assess 
their potential  contribution to individualize our assessment of liver injury that 
could be used to adjust li ver dose. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1134084] scan.  
4.3.2 Energy: Treatment will be delivered with 6 - 16 MV photons  
4.3.3 Localization, simulation, and immobilization: All subject s must  
undergo CT simulation prior to treatment, with IV and oral 
contrast if clinically appropriate. Subject s will be immobilized 
with a body cast. Liver motion will be minimize d with the use of 
either breath -hold technology or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -gaiting technology 
(respi[INVESTIGATOR_818884]-based 4D gated technique). Subject s that are 
unable to tolerate either breath -hold or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -gaiting will be 
treated free -breathing using a 4D  interna l target volume (ITV). 
Free breathing may also be used if tumor motion is <[ADDRESS_1134085] imaging orthogonal pair, using 
implanted fiducial markers, or a cone -beam C T scan.  
4.3.4 Radiation target volumes:  
The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined using the planning 
CT scan with the aid of a diagnostic imaging when clinically 
indicated (contrast -enhanced CT or MRI must be fused with the 
planning CT if IV contrast is  not given at the time of the planning 
CT scan).  GTV is defined as all parenchymal and vascular H CC 
(excluding bland thrombus). No prophylactic nodal RT is allowed.  
The CTV will be defined as the GTV for the majority of cases.  
However, CTV expansions to include regions at high risk for 
microscopic disease including non -tumor vascular th rombi, prior 
TACE sites, or adjacent RFA sites are permitted if these are 
clinically felt to be at risk. These CTV’s may be treated to a 
microscopic dose (27.5  Gy) or as hi gh as the prescription dose as 
determined by [CONTACT_099]’s discretion. The PTV around the 
GTV/CTV will be determined based upon the immobilization  
device(s) used. If breath -hold or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -gaiting technology is  
used (with daily localization), then th e total PTV margin  will be 
approximately 0.[ADDRESS_1134086] with the addition of 0.5  cm in all directions for PTV 
margin.  
4.4 SBRT Pla nning Guidelines - Radiation Doses:  
4.4.1 PTV Target Doses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Doses will be prescribed to a peripheral covering isodose  
covering the PTV.  Prescription isodose surface covers 95% 
of PTV with 90% of the prescription isodose  line covering 
99% of the PTV . The highest allowable doses to the target 
volumes that maintain normal tiss ue constraints should be 
used. A goal is that 100% of the CTV is encompa ssed by [CONTACT_247373]. Any dose > 110% must be within the PTV 
(except for adjacent tumors, in which  the maximum dose 
outside the PTV must be < 115%).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Variations  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Minor variation is defined as minimum PTV dose  
falling between 85 % and 90% (of the required 
100% isodose prescription).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Major variation (unacceptable) is defined as  
minimum PTV dose <  85% (for the required 100% 
isodose prescription).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Maximum doses are defined at 1 cc of volume.   
Maximum dose within the PTV <150% of the 
prescribed dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Minimum dose to the PTV is defined as minimum  
dose to 99.0% of th e PTV.

Vascular access is obtained via the common femoral artery and a 
guide -wire advanced under fluoroscopy. A 5/[ADDRESS_1134089] distribution 
covering the target.  
5.2.2 DEB -TACE will be performed with two vials of drug eluting beads 
of the size 75 -150 m or 100 -300 m each loaded with [ADDRESS_1134090] treatment date.  Images collected per transplant protocol 
within the 8 weeks of treatment will be repeated , as per study schematic,  to 
confirm response to treatment or progression.  
 
5.6 Crossover patients  and additional treatment in the assigned treatment 
arm:  Group  2 TACE (“Arm B”), subjects with residual disease, local 
recurrence or new lesions on radiologic imaging at the three month follow up, 
or subsequent follow ups, may be considered candi dates for additional 
treatments with  TACE or crossover to SBRT at the discretion of the provider. 
These subjects will be followed in accordance with the SBRT study calendar 
from that time point onward.  
 
For subjects treated with TACE, additional treatment s (beyond the protocol 
directed two treatments) may be administered.  SBRT subjects may be 
eligible, under provider discretion, to also have additional SBRT treatment 
done.  Refer to section 12.2 for “off study guidelines” for these subjects.

value to determine if the Grade 4 levels are transient (defined here as 
<10 days) or persistent. Subject s exhibiting hepatic toxicity ≥ 5 -20x 
baseline LFT’s will be evaluated with radiological imaging 
procedures to assess whether change in LFTs are due to tumor 
progression or treatment toxicity. Subject s whose progressive liver 
[ADDRESS_1134100] s will be evaluated for symptoms and signs of RILD or 
other  toxicity.  
8.2 Other Toxicity: The occurrence of treatment -related  Grade  4 adverse 
events in any organ system will prompt discontinuance of protocol 
therapy while appropriate physical  examination, laboratory, and imaging 
assessments are undertaken. Protocol treatment will  not be resumed in the 
absence of recovery from adverse events of this magnitude. Once  
recovery to ≤grade 2 has occurred, treatment may continue at the 
discretion of the treating  physician.  
8.3 Exceptions that will not be reported to IRB or require discontinuation of

10.4 Expected Toxicities  
10.4.1 Radiation Therapy (SBRT):  
  Nausea or vomiting.  
 Gastric or duodenal ulceration

Amendment  18 September  2017 version 7.0  
  Skin irritation, fatigue, and decrease d blood counts  
  
10.5 Liver Toxicity  
10.5.1 Radiation -induced liver disease (RILD) (veno -occlusive disease), 
including the possibility of damage severe enough to result in liver 
failure which could lead to death. In some sub jects it is not possible 
to avoid kidney irradiation which could produce a decrease in renal 
function  RILD is a clinical syndrome of anicteric ascites, 
hepatomegaly and elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) relative 
to other transaminases that may occur  2 weeks to 4 months following 
radiation to the liver.  
 ALP must be at least 2 -fold increased above the baseline  
               ALP.  
 If ascites develops at any time within [ADDRESS_1134103] and paracentesis with pathological 
evaluation of the ascitic fluid is recommended. If the ascitic 
fluid does not reveal malignancy and there is no evidence of 
disease progression in the liver or abdomen, it will be  assumed 
that RILD has occurred  
 If disease progression in the liver or abdomen has occurred, no 
diagnosis of RILD can be made.  
 In subject s who have elevation of liver enzymes near Grade 4 
levels and/or in subject s with early nonspecific signs or 
symptoms of liver injury, close follow -up is recommended 
with repeat blood work. If no t umor progression is documented 
in these subject s, liver injury will be presumed to be treatment 
related.  
10.[ADDRESS_1134104] s will be followed for GI toxicity at each follow up visit.

11.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
11.1 Local intrahepatic tumor: T he status of each treated tumor /target lesion  will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_818894] (excluding growth due to biloma or abscess formation), 
residual or new enhancement of the ablated tumor  (excluding benig n peri -
ablational  enhancement), or contiguous viable tumor. E ach treated 
intrahepatic lesion will be evaluated  utilizing mRECIST Criteria  for HCC . 
(Appendix B)  
11.2 Disease -Specific Mortality: For this study, disease -specific mortality will be 
defined as d eath due to the subject ’s disease, or death due to treatment for 
the subject ’s disease. Time zero will be defined the day of the last treatment 
fraction.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1134105] s who enroll in subsequent radiation therapeutic trials will 
be followed for survival only and for progression in the treated 
lesion(s). To further clarify, subjects who are followed for survival 
only will no longer receive protocol -directed treatment or testing.  
12.2.[ADDRESS_1134106] s who go on to receive additional  non-radiation  therapy (i.e. 
treatment that is not TACE or SBRT related)  will be followed for 
survival only.  To further clarify, subjects who are followed for 
survival only will no longer receive protocol -directed treatment or 
testing. They will also be followed for  progression within the 
treated lesion(s).  
12.2.[ADDRESS_1134107] for HCC  will 
be followed for sur vival only . To further clarify, subjects who are 
followed for survival only will no longer receive protocol -directed 
treatment or testing. They will also be followed for progression 
within the treated lesion(s).  
12.2.[ADDRESS_1134108].  
 
12.3 Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
12.3.1 Adverse Event definitions  
 An Adverse Event is any untoward medical event that  
occurs in a subject  who has  received an investigational 
treatment, and does not necessarily have a causal  
relationship with the investigational treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom,  or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational treatment, whether  or not relate d to the 
treatment.  
 Pre-existing diseases or symptoms or abnormal laboratory  
values present upon  recruitment are not considered an AE 
even when observed during the further course  of the 
study. However, every worsening of a pre -existing 
condition is consid ered as  an adverse event.  
19 
Amendment  18 September  2017 version 7.0  
  All AEs ≥ grade 3 will be collected  and attributed either as 
related to protocol treatment or not related to protocol 
treatment.  A dditional AE’s collected are :  
Any grade ≥2  gastritis, hepatic pain, vomiting, and 
fatigue.  
 The NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
4.03 (CTCAE) will be utilized to grade AE’s for AE  reporting.  
 During the course of an adverse event, severity and/or  
causality and/or seriousness may change. For CRF 
documentation this adverse event represents one entity 
from onset to resol ution and the worst of the observed 
categories shall be attributed.  
 When event reoccurs after it disappeared, it should be  
handled as a new AE.  However, AEs that occur  
intermittently can be recorded as one AE.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) shall be defin ed as an  
adverse advent which fulfills one or more of the following  
criteria:  
• Results in death . 
• Is immediately life -threatening . 
• Requires in -subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818885]  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability or  
   incapacity  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require medical  intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.   
 Any events or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818886] a n 
SAE.   
 The causality of SAEs (i.e., their relationship to study 
treatment) will be assessed by [CONTACT_818895], or not related to 
treatment.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_1134109] s’ 
medical record.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_1134110]  has another  
           liver-directed therapy or starts chemotherapy.  
12.3.4 The following types of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818887]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818888]  
 Admission for palliative care or pain management  
 Plann ed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810251], either

12.4 Data and Safety Monitoring  
This trial will be monitored in accordance with the Lahey Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818889] g Plan.  The study specific Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), consisting of the  protocol 
investigators, other health care professionals not affiliated with this study, 
the study data manager or designee , , will meet annualy . The discussion will 
include matters related to the safety of  study participants (SAE/UaP 
reporting), At the regular DSMC meetings, the protocol specific Data and 
Safety Monitoring Report  form will be completed. The report will be signed 
by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_271842]‐investigators. Data and 
Safety Monitoring Reports will be submitted to the  DSMC. on an annual  
basis for independent Review.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1134112] primary 
HCC. The trial endpoints are time to progression , number of retreatments, 
radiologic response, pathologic response, toxicity, and quality -of-life.. The planned 
accrual is sixty (60) subject s at Lahey Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] & Medical Center  over two years , an 
estimate which is based on the expected number of eligible subject s seen at Lahey . While 
this sample size will not provide adequate statistical power to test for significant 
differences in  treatment groups, it will provide effect estimates that will be used to inform 
the design of future, larger trials.  
 
  
13.[ADDRESS_1134113] s will be divided into those who receive transplant by o ne year, 
and those who do not (estimated at 50%), and stratified analyses will be 
perfor med. If differential loss to follow -up occurs between groups, analyses 
may include per -protocol and as -treated groups.  All estimates (e.g., 
proportions and means) will include 95% confidence intervals.  Descriptive 
statistics of the sample will be performed  to assess the balance of subject  
characteristics between groups, specifically age, gender, and Meld -Na score . 
The reasons why any enrolled subject s become ineligible for  further 
treatment or for transplant will be evaluated.   
13.1.1 Primary Objective : Subjects undergoing treatment will be imaged  
by [CONTACT_818896]. Any target lesions  meeting 
radiologic criteria for residual tumor or tumor progression will 
undergo repeat treatment with  either the modality first utilized 
unless such treatment is not possible , or physician discretion . The 
time to progression  will be measured and compared between 
[ADDRESS_1134114] ant, death, and stop of treatment 
before re -treatment .  
13.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 Toxicities will be summarized with frequency tables and  
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_818897] (as assessed by [CONTACT_818898]). The 
proporti on of subject s who receive any therapy that 
experience unacceptable toxicity will be estimated  and 
compared . 
 The rate of retreatments before transplantation will be 
compared between treatment groups , measured as the number 
of retreatments per subject -year of follow -up. 
 Among subject s who undergo transplantation  (estimated to be 
50% of total sample, or n=30) , Pathologic Response will be  
measured in the ex -plant liver . 
 Radiologic Response to treatment of the target lesion utilizing 
modified RECIST (mRECIST)  for HCC  at three months 
following completion of treatment wi ll be assessed as a  
dichotomous variable in subject s who complete therapy. The 
proportion  of subject s achieving lesion control in each group  at 
two months will be estimated.  
 Quality of Life will be  determined by [CONTACT_818899]-6, and the SF - 
36v2 Health Survey (35) questionnaires  at baseline,  
during treatment and follow -up. Analysis will be 
completed using the QM Certified Scoring (Insight) 
program obtained from qualitymetric.com . Mean quality -
of-life and PIQ  scores will be compared between groups.

 F.  APPENDICES  
 
Appendix A  
Model for End -Stage Liver Disease (MELD -Na) 
 
The MELD -Na score includes serum sodium level.  Sodium has been added to the formulation  
(as of January 2016)  and is  calculated using a relatively simple formula that relies on four 
readily available objective variables:  
Serum creatinine (Scr; mg/dL)  
Total bilirubin (Tbil; mg/dL)  
INR (international normalized ratio)  
Serum sodium (mmol/L)  
 
 
MELD -Na Score, UNOS modified  
 
The MELD score will be calculated to incorporate serum sodium  for candidates with a MELD score 
greater than 11. These candidates’ MELD scores will be calculated according to the initial MELD 
formula, and the MELD -Na score will be derived using the initial MELD score and the serum 
sodium value as follows:    
 
= MELD (i) + 1.32 x (137 -Na) – [0.033 x MELD (i)*(137 -Na)]  
Sodium values less than 125 mmol/L will be set to 125, and values greater than 137 
mmol/L will be set to 137.  
 
This does  not apply to candidates with a MELD score less than 12.  
 
 
The following rules must  be observed when using this formula:  
 1 is the minimum acceptable value for any of the  four variables.  
 The maximum acceptable value for serum creatinine is 4, to avoid higher MELD -Na 
       scores in subject s with concomitant intrinsic renal disease  
 The ma ximum value for the MELD -Na score is 40.

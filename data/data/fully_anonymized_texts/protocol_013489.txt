General Study Information  
 
Principal Investigator:      [INVESTIGATOR_446530], MD   
        
Study Title :    Seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 Antibodies in Previously undiagnosed Healthcare Workers  
 
Protocol version number  and date:     Version 1.0 04/17/2020  
 
Research Question and Aims  
 Hypothesis : Healthcare workers with suspected COVID -[ADDRESS_567763] demonstrate 
seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 Antibodies.  Aims, purpose , or objectives:  To identify healthcare workers with SARS CoV [ADDRESS_567764] not been 
previously dia gnosed and are presumed COVID -19 negative  and determine the level of immunity in this 
population which could inform further decisions about widespread antibody testing in a  healthcare worker 
population.   Background:    
Very little is known about the seropr evalence of SARS CoV -[ADDRESS_567765] scale to determine immunity.  Antibody testing is now available at Mayo Clinic in [LOCATION_012].  
 
Study Design and Me thods  
 Methods :  Describe in lay terms , completely detail ing the research activities that will be conducted by [CONTACT_89723] . 
 Healthcare workers in surgical and procedural areas will be contact[CONTACT_446532]. Those employees, who were identified as potentially being exposed to COVID -19 and were screened with PCR testing 
twice (with negative results), will be asked to participate in this study to check for antibodies presence in their blood. Principal Inv estigator and Co- Investigators will reach out to those employees and offer them 
participation in this study. A list of employees will be obtained from the Employee Health and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_446531].  
 Upon agreement to participate in this study, the participants  will complete a brief survey (attached).  
 
Responses to questions will be directly entered into REDCap and captured by [CONTACT_214297].  
 Study participants will be asked to have a blood test for antibodies performed at Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012]. Approximately 5ml of blood will be obtained for thi s test. The charge for this test is being covered by [CONTACT_32346]’ insurance per CARES Act.

 Official letter from Mayo Clinic to Medica included in the IRB application. Per email discussion with Cathryn 
Fraser, Christina Zorn, and Mark Parkulo, MD, the  antibodies testing will be paid for by [CONTACT_446533].  Should results come back with presence of antibodies;  the employees will be notified and instructed to follow 
up with their PCP. The test is not aimed at detecting pre sence of COVID -19, only antibodies.  
 
Subject Information  
 Target accrual  is the p roposed total number of subjects to be included in this study  at Mayo Clinic . A “Subject” 
may include medical records, images, or specimens  generated at  Mayo Clinic  and/or  received from external

Review of medical records, images, specimens   
 
 
Check all that apply  (data includes medical records, images, specimens ).  
 
  Only  data that exists be fore the IRB submission date  will be collected .   
 
Date Range for Specimens and/or Review of Medical Record s:   
Example s: 01/01/ 1999 through 12/31/2015, or all records through mm/dd/yyyy.  
 
Note: The Date Range must include the period for collection of baseline data, as well as  follow -up data, 
if applicable.  
 
  The study involves data  that exist at the time of IRB submission and  data that will be generat ed after IRB 
submission. Include  this activity in the Methods  section.  
Examples  
• The study plans to conduct a retrospective chart review and a sk subjec ts to complete a questionnaire .  
• The study plans to include subjects previously diagnosed with a specific  disease and add new ly 
diagnosed subjects in the future.  
 
  The study will use data that have been collected under another IRB protocol . Include in the Methods  section 
and e nter the IRB number from which the research material will be obtained. When appropriate , note when 
subjects have provided consent for future use of their data and/or specimens  as described in this protocol .  
 Enter one IRB number per line, add more lines as needed

 Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but end- point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if not including all of the infor mation.  
 Power Statement :   
This is an exploratory study and power statement is not applicable at this time.  Data Analysis Plan:  Descriptive statistics and mean, median will be reported for the entire data set. The information will be deducted based on the frequency of identified healthcare workers with demonstrated immunity to COVID -19.

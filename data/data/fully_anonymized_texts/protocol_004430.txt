5/7/[ADDRESS_311811] cancer, and achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR), usually defined as the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast and axillary nodes (ypT0/is N0) , 
in these patients is associated with excellent long -term outcomes  (1,2) . However, the 
optimal chemotherapy regimen, in terms of effic acy and toxicity, is not clear. In the 
adjuvant setting, patients exposed to both an anthracycline and trastuzumab have significantly higher rates of cardiac toxicity and leukemogenesis  than patients treated 
with a non-anthracycline- containing regimen and trastuzumab  (such as docetaxel, 
carboplatin and trastuzumab, TCH), while long- term breast cancer -free outcomes are not 
significantly different (3). In the neoadjuvant setting, the addition of pertuzumab to the 
combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab appears to substantially increase the percentage of patients who achieve a pCR, though the impact of this enhanced locoregional response on long- term outcomes is not yet known (4,5). On the randomized 
phase II TRYPHAENA neoadjuvant trial, patients who received a non- anthracycline -
containing regimen  consisting of TCH plus pertuzumab (TCHP) administered ev ery 3 
weeks for 6 cycles had a pCR rate of 64% compared to 55% for patients who received 
sequential therapy with an anthracycline -based regimen , with or without concurrent 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab, followed by [CONTACT_256476] (FEC+/ -HP→THP)  (5). While these results support the efficacy of the non-anthracycline-
containing TCHP regimen, they do not rule out the existence of a subset of HER2 -
positive patients who would benefit from treatment with an anthracycline . TCH is 
associated with such severe and prolonged neutropenia that m any patients require the 
administration of a myeloid growth factor such as peg filgrastim to reduc e the risk  of 
infections, and the addition of pertuzumab to this regimen inc reases the risk of severe and 
occasionally life- threatening toxicities,  especially neutropenia and diarrhea (5). In 
HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, t he combination of weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab 
and pertuzumab ha s similar  antitumor efficacy as docetaxel with trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab and a much more favorable toxicity profile (6). I n the neoadjuvant setting, 
administration of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin with trastuzumab has been shown to induce a high pCR rate  (7-9). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_256463]-tolerated combination in patients with stage I  (clinical 
T=2.0 cm)- III HER2 -positive breast cancer, and  to assess wheth er patients with a 
suboptimal response to 12 weeks of the weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin with 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab (wPCbTP) regimen benefit  from switching to an 
anthracycline- based r egimen , specifically doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC).   
 II. Objectives  
     A. Primary  
 1. Measure the percent of patients who achieve a pCR (ypT0/isN0) in the 
following populations:       a. The overall study population 
      b. Patients with an optimal clinical response (>50% reduction in the sum of 
their breast tumor’s two -dimensional measurements ) to wPCbTP at 12 weeks

   i. who complete 18 weeks of the wPCbTP regimen  
  ii. who complete less than 18 weeks of the wPCbTP regimen but do not receive any additional chemotherapy  
  iii. who switch to AC in the neoadjuvant setting for any reason       c. Patients with a suboptimal clinical response ( <50% reduction in the sum of 
their breast tumor’s two -dimensional measurements ) to wPCbTP at 12 weeks 
  i. who switch to AC in the neoadjuvant setting   ii. who complete 18 weeks of the wPCbTP regimen (did not switch despi[INVESTIGATOR_256464] 12 weeks)     iii. who complete less than 18 weeks of the wPCbTP regimen but did not receive any additional chemotherapy  
          2. Measure the percent of patients who achieve pCR or RCB I in the same patient populations           3. Measure the percentage of patients with optimal and suboptimal response to wPCbTP at 12 weeks           4. Measure the percentage of patients who develop major toxicities (defin ed below) 
during their neoadjuvant therapy (wPCbTP or AC)  
               a. Neutropenia (grade>2 )   
   b. Febrile neutropenia (grade 3 -4)  
    c. Thrombocytopenia (grade >2)  
    d. Anemia (grade >2) 
    e . Diarrhea (any grade, grade > 3)   
    f. Neuropathy (any grade, grade 2, grade >3) 
    g . Vomiting ( any grade, grade > 3)  
    h. O ther grade >3 toxicities  
          5. Measure delivery of treatment with the wPCbTP regimen over 12 weeks and (where appropriate) [ADDRESS_311812]-conserving surgery (BCS) at baseline who become candidates for BCS after treatment (whether or not the patient opts for BCS or mastectomy )  
    b. The percentage of patients who would have required a full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at study entry who become candidates for sentinel node sampling (SLN) after treatment 
   c. Assess the impact of splitting the loading dose of pertuzumab between weeks 
[ADDRESS_311813] loading dose (840 mg) on we ek 
1 on the incidence and severity of diarrhea and other toxicities experienced during cycles 
1 and 2 of wPCbTP.

cancer and , when indi cated, sampling (FNA or needle biopsy) of a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_256465], ultrasound and/or MRI of the breast for tumor measurement, baseline 
blood tests, including a pregnancy test when appropriate, cardiac evaluation (echocardiogram or MUGA scan) , and staging studies to rule out overt metastatic disease 
(strongly recommended for stage III or if clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798]).   
B. Once the patient agrees to participate in the study, her treating doctors will record their assessment as to whether, prior to tre atment, the patient would have required a 
mastectomy, and if so why, or if the patient would have been a candidate for BCS, and whether the patient would require an ALND or would be a candidate for SLN sampling.      
C. The  patient will then initiate neoadjuvant therapy  with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (or nab -
paclitaxel 80 -100 mg/m2) and carboplatin AUC 2 a dministered weekly with  no planned 
treatment breaks (3 weeks = 1 cycle) . Trastuzumab can be administered either every 3 
weeks ( 8 mg/kg cycle 1 then 6 mg/kg cycles 2 -4) or weekly (4 mg/kg week 1 then 2 
mg/kg week s 2-12). Pertuzumab will be administered every 3 weeks , with either a 
loading dose (840 mg) week 1  of cycle 1 , or two doses (420 mg each) weeks 1 and 2 of 
cycle 1 , with the week 2 dose held if the patient is already experiencing grade > [ADDRESS_311815], o ur 
recommendation is that chemotherapy be delayed or modified only for moderately se vere 
neutropenia (<800/mm3) or thrombocytopenia (<50,000/mm3) or persistent grade > 2 non-
hematologic toxicities (neuropathy, diarrhea, etc.) on the day of treatment , or for a 
serious or life -threatening toxicity, such as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_239132] a bleed 
requiring an urgent platelet transfusion, during the previous cycle . If chemotherapy is 
delayed, the HER2-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256466].  
E. Patients should be assessed clinically every q3 weeks  and as indicated f or any 
significant new symp toms or findings; patients with disease progression o n the wPCbTP 
regimen should be switched to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2  or 3 
weeks for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_44850], taken immediately to surgery or removed from the study (in which case they will be considered a non-pCR).  
F. At the end of [ADDRESS_311816] US or MRI to 
assess their response to treatment. Patients with >50% reduction in the sum of the [ADDRESS_311817] tumor  (or axillary node, if the breast tumor is occult) 
will be labelled optimal responders and should continue the wPCbTP regimen for another 2 cycles . Patients with < 50% reduction in the sum o f the [ADDRESS_311818] 4 
cycles of wPCbTP, each patient’s treatment is left to the discretion of the treating oncologist based on response evaluation and toxicity concerns.  
G. In patients switched to AC, a repeat cardiac evaluation to rule out a significant fall in

 their LVEF prior to starting that treatment is recommended . Patients who receive AC 
every 2 weeks (dose-dense AC) should receive growth factor support, either 
pegfilgrastim or filgrastim.  
H. If there is uncertainty regarding a patient’s response to treatment after 4 cycles of 
wPCbTP based on imaging studies, a repeat tumor biopsy can be performed; a complete 
or near -complete pathologic response in this biopsy sample would justify continuing 
wPCbTP as opposed to switching to AC.  
I. After the completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the patient ’s eligibility for breast 
conserving surgery vs. mastectomy and ALND vs. SLN sampling will be reassessed, and 
the surgical plan recorded.  
J. After surgery, the patient’s actual surgical management will be recorded. Her 
pathologic response to treatment will be scored by [CONTACT_256477] (if residual invasive disease is present).  
K. Post- op, patients may receive additional chemotherapy, endocrine therapy ( if ER or 
PR positive) and radiation treatments  at physician discretion, as well as completing a  year 
of trastuzumab. Adjuvant pertuzumab may be added if the results of the APHINITY trial demonstrate a benefit to this treatment. Post- op treatment s and any residual or delayed 
toxicities attributed to th e patient’s neoadjuvant therapy will be collected at a follow -up 
visit approximately [ADDRESS_311819] 2 months after completion of protocol chemotherapy (l onger if they receive post-op chemotherapy).    
L. Patients will be asked to give permission to collect r esidual tumor tissue from their 
diagnostic biopsies, any other biopsies that were performed (such as after week 12) and their surgical specimens (if pr esent) to be used for future correlative studies.   
M. Our assumption is that pCR (ypT0/isN0) will be achieved in at least 70% of patients with wPCbTP +/ - AC and this r esponse assessment/switching strategy .

5. Patients with multiple foci of invasive cancer in the same breast are eligible if any single lesion meets the above size criteria and all sampled lesions > 1 cm in maximum dimension are histologically similar and HER2+ . Patients are also 
eligible if there is a focus of HER2 - invasive cancer that is < [ADDRESS_311822] from the HER2+ cancer , such that 
its presence will not interfere with clinical or pathologic assessment of response of the HER2+ cancer ; whether radiographically detected lesions adjacent to but 
separate from the target lesion - ‘satellite’ lesions - are sampled for histologic 
evaluation and marker analysis is left to the discretion of the treating physicians. The presence of DCIS or LCIS in either b reast will not render a patient ineligible. 
Patients with a small focus of invasive cancer detected in the contralateral breast (clinical T1a/bN0) are eligible, whether the contralateral tumor i s HER2+ or 
HER2 -, while patients with a more advanced invasive cancer in the contralateral 
breast are not eligible; in patients with a small focus of invasive cancer in the contralateral breast or a small focus of HER2- cancer in the same breast only the histologic response in the HER2+ target lesion will be consider ed in determining 
the patient's pathologic response.

 VI. Suggested dose modifications for chemotherapy  
 While decisions regarding treatment delays or modifications will be left to the treating oncologist, and their occurrence and rationale collected, the following are guidelines and not requirements: 
A. Hematologic toxicities:  
1. Neutropenia – OK to proceed with paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  and carboplatin 
with ANC >800. If treatment is held for neutropenia this should be a treatment 
delay; skippi[INVESTIGATOR_256469]. If treatment is held 2 consecutive weeks for neutropenia, when treatment is resumed the dose of paclitaxel/nab -
paclitaxel  should be reduced by 25 % to paclitaxel 60 mg/m
2 or nab- paclitaxel 
60-75 mg/m2. Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg SC daily x 3 -5 days per week (between 
days 2 and 6) may be added to try to avoid further dose modification. If 
neutropenia requiring a second hold of [ADDRESS_311831] has the option of reducing the paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  dose by [CONTACT_20904] 25% and the carboplatin 
dose b y 25% or adding filgrastim (if not added previously) 5 mcg/kg SC daily 
x 3-5 days per week (between days 2 and 6) to try to avoid further reduction of 
the chemotherapy doses.  
2. Febrile neutropenia – Should r educe paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  by 25%. 
Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg SC da ily x 3 -5 days per week (between days 2 and 6) may  
be added to try to avoid further epi[INVESTIGATOR_256470].  
3. Thrombocytopenia – OK to proceed with paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  and 
carboplatin with platelet count >50,000. If treatment is held for 
thrombocytopenia even once, when treatment is resumed the dose of carboplatin should be reduced by 25% (to AUC 1.5). If treatment has to be held for thrombocytopenia on AUC 1.5, should reduce carboplatin to AUC 1.0. If treatment has to be held for thrombocytopenia on AUC 1.0, should discontinue carboplatin. 
4. Anemia – No recommended dose modifications. Transfuse as indicated.   
B. Non-hematologic toxicities  
1. Neuropathy – Should r educe paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  by 25% for grade 2  
peripheral  neuropathy. Should hold treatment for grade 3 neuropathy, resume 
with 25% reduction of paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  when improves to grade < 2. If 
does not improve to grade <2 within 3 weeks, or if progresses from grade 2 to

discontinue wPCbTP regimen and either switch to AC, take to surgery or 
remove from study.  
2. Diarrhea – A) Patients receiving pertuzumab [ADDRESS_311832] be assessed for diarrhea prior to administration of the week 2 dose, and the dose omitted for grade >1 diarrhea.  B) At all other times during study 
treatment, all treatment (including tras tuzumab and pertuzumab) should be 
held for grade > 2 when due to resume treatment . If treatment is held for >2 
weeks for grade 2 diarrhea or patient develops grade 3 diarrhea, when treatment resumes should temporarily discontinue pertuzumab; resumption of pertuzumab following improvement in or control of diarrhea on medication is at the discretion of the treating oncologist. If grade >2 diarrhea recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_256471], discontinue the wPC bTP regimen and either switch to AC, take to surgery or 
remove from study.  
3. Vomiting – Should hold treatment for grade >[ADDRESS_311833]- chemotherapy nausea or 
vomiting that resolves by [CONTACT_256482].  
4. Allergic reactions –  
a. Paclitaxel - Patients who experience a significant (grade > 2) 
hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may, at the discretion of the treating oncologist, be re -challenged with additional premedications 
and/or changes in the rate of administration of the drug or switched to nab-paclitaxel.  
b. Carboplatin – Patients who experience a significant (grade >2) 
hypersensitivity reaction to carboplatin may, at the discretion of the treating oncologist, be re -challenged with add itional premedications 
and/or changes in the rate of administration of the drug or undergo desensitization with the goal of continuing this part of their treatment, or treatment with carboplatin may  be permanently discontinued. If this 
occurs prior to the week 12 reassessment, the patient should continue on treatment with paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel, trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab (wPTP) until week 12. It is left to the discretion of the treating oncologist as to whether this would influence his/her decision to continue wPTP or switch to AC at any time after week 12.        
5. Other grade >2 toxicities. Physician discretion as to whether toxicity warrants 
treatment delay, dose modification or discontinuation of wPCbTP regimen. 
 
C. If paclitaxel/nab -paclitaxel  and carboplatin chemotherapy is delayed due to 
hematologic or non- hematologic toxicity,  the patient should continue trastuzumab 
(every 3 weeks or weekly) and pertuzumab (every 3 weeks).  
  
D. Dose modifications during AC are left to the discretion of the treating oncologist.

VII. Required data 
To reduce the burden of data collection, and because treatment modifications are primarily left up to the treating investigator, lab results will not be collected. Submis sion 
of data sheets collecting pertinent data is required at the following time points:  
 
A. On-study data sheet: Baseline tumor stage, measurements (US or MRI), histologic 
confirmation of malignancy with ER, PR and HER2 status (pathology report), clinical/histologic status of ipsilateral axilla PS, pretreatment assessment of operability (mastectomy vs. lumpectomy, ALND vs.SLN only).  On study information required for BrUOG review before registration. 
B. s/p 2 cycles wPCbTP : Treatment and toxicity data  
C. s/p 4 cycles wPCbTP: Treatment and toxicity data, results of reassessment (US or MRI), treatment plan going forward  
D. Pre-op (s/p 6 cycles of wPCbTP or 4 cycles of AC): Treatment and toxicity data, 
pre-op assessment of operability (including US or MRI, if done)  
E. Post-op: Surgical outcomes, pathology results, RCB number and class if not pCR 
F. [ADDRESS_311834]-op: Post-op treatment received and planned, delayed or persistent toxicities   
VIII. Pathologic analysis  
 
A. Definition of pCR: A patient will be considered to have achieved a pCR if there is no residual invasive cancer in the submitted breast tissue (the presence of DCIS or microinvasion (T1mic) will not disqualify a patient from being defined a pCR) or in any sampled axillary node s (the presence of isolated tumor cells – N0i+ - will 
not disqualify a patient from being defined a pCR).  
B. Residual Cancer Burden: In patients who do not meet the definition of pCR, the pathologist will be asked to quantify the residual cancer burden (RCB) , as defined 
by [CONTACT_256483]. The RCB value can be calculated using an online calculator that can be accessed at the site below, and the necessary data to calculate the value is listed below:

 IX. Recording Surgical options : Surgical data will not be collected on patients who come 
off study prior to the week 12 assessment, but response and surgical data (including 
pathology report results) will be collected on all patients who come off study any time after the 12 week assessment.  
A. Eligibility for BCS: At baseline and again after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the patient’s ph ysicians (ideally her surgeon) will be asked to assess 
whether she is a candidate for BCS – whether or not the patient is interested in BCS – and, if not, why (tumor size or location, multicentric invasive disease, DCIS or other imaging or histologic findings elsewhere in the breast, poor candidate for radiation, etc.) This will be recorded on the pre- and post- treatment 
surgical assessment form.  
B. Axillary management: At baseline and again after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the patient’s p hysicians (again, ideally her surgeon) will be asked to 
assess the clinical status of her axilla and whether she requires an ALND or, if clinically N0, is a candidate for SLN sampling only. This is also recorded on the surgical assessment form.  
C. At the pat ient post-op visit, the surgery performed (breast and axilla) should be 
recorded, and whether this was different from her pre-op surgical plan and if so why.  
X. Pharmaceutical information  – See Appendix II 
 XI. Record Retention  
 
The investigator will main tain all study records according to ICH- GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirement(s).   
 
The Brown University Oncology Research Group, as coordinator of this study, is responsible for ensuring proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and the validity of the data recorded on the case report forms. The Principal Investigators (William Sikov, M.D.  and Mary Lopresti, D.O.) and Brown University Oncology 
Research Group Director of Operations (Kayla Rosati) will monitor this study. The case report forms will be monitored against the submitted documents for accuracy, 
completeness, adherence to the protocol and regulatory compliance. 
 
 
All records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of drug, including CRFs, consents forms, laboratory test results and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_311835]  
 All trials initiated by [CONTACT_101448] (BrUOG) are 
subject to oversight by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB).  This board meets 
two times per year with any additional meetings scheduled when needed.  The responsibilities are as follows:

5/7/18 
 • Familiarize themselves with the research protocol (s)  
• The DSMB reviews trial performance information such as accrual information.   
• Review interim analyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries 
to determine whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be terminated based on these data.   
• The DSMB also determines whether and to whom outcome results should be 
released prior to the reporting of study results.  
• All adverse events are reviewed by [CONTACT_942], with assurances that these have 
been in fact sent for review to all pertinent IRBs. 
• Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study needs to be changed or terminated.  
• Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation (e.g., termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_101404], increasing target sample size).  
• Following each DSMB meeting, provide the study leadership with written 
information concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.  
 The study leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant recommendations to the local principal investigators to be shared with their IRB’s.   XIII. Statistical design  
 The study will continue until at least 30 evaluable patients are enrolled and treated. The pCR and pCR + RCB I rates for the overall study population and the subpopulations listed in Section II. A. 1- 2 will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals. If we 
achieve an overall pCR rate of 70% in 30 patients, the 95% confidence interval for the pCR rate ( 50-85% ) will essentially exclude an actual pCR with these regimens and this 
‘switching’ strategy of less than 50%, with  an alpha 0.07 and power of 77%, according to 
both the Fleming design and exac t binomial tests.

    c. Thrombocytopenia (grade > 2)  
    d. Anemia (grade > 2) 
    e. Diarrhea (any grade, grade > 3)

participation (declines participation) or at the time patient becomes a screen failure, 
whichever occurs first.  If a patient comes off study early, prior to completion of all 
treatment, the SAE review period will be [ADDRESS_311839] treatment.  
Regarding SAEs: A ll SAEs, whether related or unrelated, will be reported from the time 
a signed and dated ICF is obtained until [ADDRESS_311840] 
withdraws consent from study participation (declines participation) or at the time patient 
becomes a screen failure, whichever occurs first.  If a patient comes off study early, prior 
to completion of all treatment, the SAE review period will be [ADDRESS_311841] medical 
treatment given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in 
treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication).  
This study will utilize the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_311842] access to a copy of the CTCAE versio n 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical prod uct and that does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use treatmen t regimen whether or not 
considered related. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of drug.

5/7/[ADDRESS_311843]. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.)  
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded  in the case report form for the duration of the trial, 
regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medication. All AEs considered related to trial medication will be followed until resolution even if this occurs post- trial. 
Definitions  
An adverse event  is any new, undesirable medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered product- related.  
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
An adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes (CFR 312.32): 
• death  
• is life -threatening  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256472], transfusion support, disease staging/re- staging 
procedures, concomitant radiotherapy, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other serious events. 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• congenital anomaly / birth defect.  
The definition of s erious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical 
event . Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or  result in  death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256473].  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A new diagnosis of cancer during the course o f treatment should be considered an important medical event. 
The definition of “related” being that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience. 
Unexpected adverse event  
An adverse event that is not mentioned in the package insert or informed consent or the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the investigator's brochure or package insert.

BRUOG ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Investigators are required by [CONTACT_256485]. 
Questions regarding drugs as used in this study should be directed to the Brown 
University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG) Central Office, Phone: ([PHONE_5340] Fax ([PHONE_5341], which will in turn notify the Principal Inv estigator.  
Intensity for each adverse event will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage (http://ctep.info.nih.gov
).  All appropriate treatment ar eas have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with r espect to the test drug, and the 
patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness. 
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on study drug or within [ADDRESS_311845]’s last treatment are considered expedited reportable events.  If the subject is receiving treatment, the drugs are to be discontinued immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_256486] 24 hours and BrUOG will in turn report to FDA within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_17084]/or facsimile using the 3500A MedWatch form. Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on treatment (drug), or within 4 weeks (30 days) of the subject’s last treatment, are considered immediately reportable events. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to BrUOG via the Medwatch3500A form.
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify BrUOG of the outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a follow-up to the initial report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event to BrUOG who will then report to the FDA). 
Any suspected fetal exposure must be reported to BrUOG within 24 hours who will then 
report to the FDA within 1 working day of being made aware of the event.  The patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.

 Appendix II: Pharmaceutical information 
Qualified personnel who are famili ar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
themselves and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling and safe 
disposal of chemotherapeutic agents in a self -contained, protective environment. For full 
instructions and guidelines, please always refer to the package inserts for the drugs being used in this trial, below is just a summary of basic information for each drug.  
 1. Paclitaxel (Taxol) 
Formulation:  Commercially available for injection 6 mg/mL (5 mL, 16.7 mL, 25 mL, and 
50 mL) (contains alcohol and purified Cremophor EL {polyoxyethylated castor oil}).  
Preparation, Storage and Stability:  
Unopened vials of TAXOL (paclitaxel) Injection are stable until the date indicated on the 
package when stored between 20°–25° C (68°–77° F), in the original package. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product. Upon refrigeration, components in the TAXOL vial may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], but  will redissolve upon reaching room 
temperature with little or no agitation. There is no impact on product quality under these circumstances. If the solution remains cloudy or if an insoluble precipi[INVESTIGATOR_256474], the vial should be discarded. Solutions for infusion prepared as recommended are stable at ambient temperature (approximately 25° C) and lighting conditions for up to 27 hours. 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. TAXOL (paclitaxel) Injection must b e diluted prior to infusion. TAXOL should be diluted 
in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Ringer ’s Injection to a final 
concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL.  The solutions are physically and chemically stable for 
up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25° C) and room lighting conditions. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. 
Upon preparation, solutions may show haziness, which is attributed to the formulation 
vehicle. No significant losses in potency have been noted following simulated delivery of the solution through IV tubing containing an in-line (0.22 micron) filter. 
Administration: Administer under the supervision of a health care provider experienced in 
the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of complications is 
possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.  
TAXOL should be administered through an in- line filter with a microporous membrane not 
greater than 0.22 microns. 
Administer dose per the protocol. 
Drug Interactions:  
The metabolism of TAXOL is ca talyzed by [CONTACT_9058] P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when TAXOL is concomitantly administered with 
known substrates (eg, midazolam, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, and triazolam), inhibitors (eg, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir,

 itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and 
telithromycin), and inducers (eg, rifampin and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) of CYP3A4.  
Caution should also be exercised when TAXOL is concomitantly administered with known 
substrates (eg, repaglinide and rosiglitazone), inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil), and inducers (eg, rifampin) of CYP2C8.  
Adverse Events Consult the package insert for the most current and complete information. 
Percentages repo rted with single -agent therapy.  
TAXOL is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to 
TAXOL or other drugs formulated in Cremophor® 
EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil).  
 
Toxicities  
U.S. Boxed Warning: Bone marrow suppression is the dose -limiting toxicity; do not 
administer if baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <1500 cells/mm3 (1000 
cells/mm3 for patients with AIDS -related KS); reduce future doses by 20% for severe

 Nursing Guidelines:  
Premedicate with steroids, antihistamines, and H2 blockers as per institutional guidelines. 
Mix the infusion bag well. Thorough admixture of this drug often prevents a hypersensitivity reaction.  
Assess the patient frequently for the first 30 minutes. Taxol® hypersensitivity reactions, 
which may include chest pain, back pain, flushing, diaphoresis, dyspnea, pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm and/or urticaria, usually occur early in the infusion. Have the anaphylaxis tray available. If a reaction occurs, stop the infusion immediately. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], IV fluids, diphenhydramine, and methylprednisolone may be used as per phys ician ’s order.  
Approximately 60% of patients experience peripheral sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning pain, fine motor skills impairment, paresthesias, distal sensory loss). Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents and opi[INVESTIGATOR_256475].  
Monitor CBC closely. Neutropenia is most severe in patients who have had previous 
chemotherapy. Instruct patient to report signs or symptoms of infection, unusual bruising or bleeding to the health care team.  
Monitor IV  site closely and establish patency before administration. Paclitaxel is an irritant, 
however rarely rash, radiation recall, and ulceration have occurred with infiltration of drug.  
Monitor liver function tests  
Inform patient about total alopecia.  If giv en on the same day as a platinum agent, paclitaxel should be administered first to 
limit myelosuppression and enhance efficacy of agent. 
Availability: Commercial product will be utilized.  
2. Nab-Paclitaxel   
Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  Each single -use 50 ml vial will contain paclitaxel (100 mg) and approximately 900 mg 
human albumin (HA) as a stabilizer.  Unreconstituted Abraxane should be stored at 
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C or 68°  to 77°F) in its carton.  Reconstituted 
Abraxane should be  used immediately.  If not used immediately, the vial of reconstituted 
Abraxane must be placed in its carton and be placed in a refrigerator at 2 ° to 8°C (36 ° to 
46°F) for a maximum of [ADDRESS_311848] be accessible only to study personnel.  
     
Administration  
NOTE: It is not a requirement to use filter needles in the preparation of, or in- line filters 
during the administration of Abraxane. In any event, filters of pore -size less than [ADDRESS_311849] not be used. Abraxane will be reconstituted by [CONTACT_256488].  The investigator will calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient in order to determine the total amount of paclitaxel to be administered.

5/7/18 
 Administer dose per the protocol. 
 
Reconstitution and use of Abraxane: 
• Calculate the patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and if the 
weight changes by > 10% by [CONTACT_256489] s tudy manual.  
• Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered = BSA x 100 mg/m2 (unless 
dose is modified by [CONTACT_256490]).  
• Calculate the total number of vials required by: 
[CONTACT_192488] = Total Dose (mg) 
100 (mg/vial) 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when a fractional number of vials is obtained by [CONTACT_192489] (e.g., if the total number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol. Reconstitute each Abraxane vial by [CONTACT_44579] 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP or equivalent into each vial over a period of not less than 1 minute.  
• Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_311850]  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly onto the 
lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming.  
• Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) minutes to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.   
• Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minu tes until complete 
dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Rapid agitation or shaking will result in foaming. 
• If foaming or clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_4095], stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam 
subsides. 
• Each ml of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of p aclitaxel.  
• Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the 
patient: 
Dosing volume (ml) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/ml)  
• The reconstituted sample should be milky and homogeneous without visible particulates.  If unsuspended powder is visible, the vial should be  gently  
inverted again to ensure complete resuspension, prior to use.

 • Once the exact volume of reconstituted Abraxane has been withdrawn from the 
vials, discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard 
operating procedures. 
• Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted Abraxane suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC IV bag using an injection port.  Inject perpendicularly into the center of the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag.   
• Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted Abraxane suspension by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes.  The use of in- line filters is not necessary.  If 
used, in- line filters with pore sizes  of < 15µ should not be used. 
• Use within 8 hours of reconstitution.  If not used immediately, store 
reconstituted Abraxane in a refrigerator for no longer than 8 hours.

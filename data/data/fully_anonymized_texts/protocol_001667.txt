Glossary of terms 
Assessment  A procedure used to generate data required by [CONTACT_90166]  A specific group of subjects fulfilling certain criteria  
Control drug  Any drug (an active drug or an inactive drug, such as a placebo) which is 
used as a comparator to the investigational drug being tested in the trial 
Dosage  Dose of the study treatment given to the subject in a time unit (e.g. 100 mg 
once a day, 75 mg twice a day)  
Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC)  Electronic data capture (EDC) is the electronic acquisition of clinical study data using data collection systems, such as Web- based applications, 
interactive voice response systems and clinical laboratory interfaces. EDC 
includes the use of Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) which are used 
to capture data transcribed from paper source forms used at the point of 
care 
Enrollment  Point/time of subject entry into the study; the point at which informed consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to starting any of the procedures 
described in the protocol).  
Estimand   A precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question 
posed by [CONTACT_6553]. It summarizes at a population- level what the 
outcomes would be in the same patients under different treatment 
conditions being compared. Attributes of an estimand include the population,  variable (or endpoint) and treatment of interest, as well as the 
specification of how the remaining intercurrent events are addressed and a 
population -level summary for the variable.  
Investigational drug  The study drug whose properties are being tested in the study; this 
definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is synonymous 
with “investigational new drug” or “investigational medicinal product”.  
Medication number  A unique identifier on the label of each study drug package in studies that  
dispense study drug using an IRT system.  
Part A single component of a study which contains different objectives or 
populations within that single study. Common parts within a study are: a single dose part and a multiple dose part, or a part in patients w ith 
established disease and in those with newly -diagnosed disease.  
Patient  An individual with the condition of interest  
Period  A minor subdivision of the study timeline; divides phases into smaller 
functional segments such as screening, baseline, titrati on, washout, etc.  
Randomization 
number  A unique identifier assigned to each randomized subject, corresponding to a 
specific treatment arm assignment  
Screen Failure  A subject who is screened but is not treated or randomized  
Study completion  Point/time at which the subject came in for a final evaluation visit or when 
study drug was discontinued whichever is later.  
Study drug/treatment  Any drug (or combination of drugs) administered to the subject as part of the required study procedures; includes investigational drug, active drug 
run-ins or background therapy.  
Discontinuation from 
study  Point/time when the participant permanently stops receiving the study treatment and further protocol required assessments or follow -up, for any 
reason. No specific request is made to stop the use of their samples or 
data.  
Discontinuation from 
study treatment  Point/time when the participant permanently stops receiving the study 
treatment for any reason (prior to the planned completion of study drug 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 9 
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
administrati on, if any). Participant agrees to the other protocol required 
assessments including follow -up. No specific request is made to stop the 
use of their samples or data.  
Subject  An individual who has consented to participate in this study. The term 
Subject ma y be used to describe either a healthy volunteer or a patient.  
Subject number  A number assigned to each subject who enrolls in the study. When 
combined with the center number, a unique identifier is created for each 
subject in the study.  
Variable  A measured value or assessed response that is determined in specific 
assessments and used in data analysis to evaluate the drug being tested in 
the study  
Vehicle  A vehicle refers to the inactive version of the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) i.e., it contains all the components of the IMP with the 
exception of the drug (active ingredient).  In this protocol, the term placebo 
may be used interchangeably with vehicle as the placebo also does not 
contain any drug (active ingredient).  
Withdrawal of 
cons ent (WoC)  Withdrawal of consent from the study is defined as when a subject does not want to participate in the study any longer, and does not want any further 
visits or assessments, and does not want any further study related contact, 
and does not allow a nalysis of already obtained biologic material

Amendment rationale (Version No.3, 06-Oct -2021) 
The main purpose of this amendment is to modify the types of refractive surgery to be included, 
as well as revise some of the inclusion criteria so that the patients recruited for the study will be more representative of the true population of patients experiencing post -operative corneal 
induced chronic pain. This amendment also makes specific allowance for optometrists to serve as a primary care provider for the purposes of the study. 
 
• Section 5  “Population” and throughout the document : To modify the types of 
refractive surgery in the study population so that it is inclusive of subjects with various 
types of corneal refractive surgery or cataract surgery in both eyes (including LASEK, RK, SMILE and Cataract surgeries) with resulting CICP.  
• Section 5.1 Revised Inclusion Criteria #2 to #2a: Revision of the criterion to include 
optometrist since in some US states, optometrists may be the primary eye care professional managing patients with post-surgical CICP.  
• Section 5.1 Revised Inclusion Criteria #3 to #3a: Revision of Visit 1 pain severity 
question to “worst pain over the last 7 days”. Since chronic pain fluctuates, this single screening question may be more representative of their overall experience with CICP. The ocular pain severity VAS cutoff is revised from ≥ 50 mm to ≥ 30 mm.  
• Section 5.1 Revised Inclusion Criteria #5 to #5a: The last 7 days average pain severity 
VAS prior to the Baseline visit (Visit 2)  is revised from ≥ 50 mm to ≥ 30 mm to align 
with threshold value outlined in Inclusion Criteria #3a at screening visit.  
• Section 5.2 Revised Exclusion Criteria #1 to #1a: Since many CICP are using bandage 
and scleral lenses as non -pharmacological treatment for CICP, this patient group is now 
included. 
• Section 5.2 Revised Exclusion Criteria #20 to #20a: Remove the duplicative text similar 
to Exclusion Criteria #14. The criteria is also updated to exclude the subject who is unable or willing to comply with the protocol requirements.  
• Section 8.1 “Screening”: Addition of clarification under what circumstance re- screening 
is permitted under the current protocol version. 
• Tablet 8-1 and Table 8 -2: To include “Contact [CONTACT_12067]” as a mandatory task in the 
assessment schedule and the proposed sequence to perform the task   
• Section [IP_ADDRESS] “Post -Anesthetic Severity of Eye Pain: Anesthetic procedure is updated 
to align with other modifications in this amendment 
• Section 12.4.6 Revised the supplementary estimand based on treatment policy strategy.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors belong to the superfamily of TRP 
Ca2+-permeable non -selective cation channels ( Clapham  et al 2001). These channels are 
expressed primarily on a subset of somatic and visceral primary afferent sensory neurons (Holzer  2004; Gunthorpe et  al 2002; Hayes  et al 2000). TRPV1 can be activated by [CONTACT_304082], 
noxious heat, acidic solutions, mechanical distortion, hyperosmolarity and inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, prostaglandins and nerve growth factor (NGF), which are likely to be released or upregulated by [CONTACT_359987] 
(Caterina and  Julius 2001; Geppetti  and Trevisani  2004). The activation of TRPV1 results in 
nociceptive stimu li interpreted by [CONTACT_359988]. Importantly, chronic peripheral nociceptor 
activity can further increase the release of the inflammatory mediators which regulate TRPV1 activity, and results in a sensitization of the channel and a lowering of its thresholds for activation causing hyperalgesia and allodynia. Taken together, these findings indicate that TRPV1 is a key integrator of nociceptive and inflammatory response information. 
Accumulating data indicates a primary role for TRPV1 receptors in ocular pain 
(Zhang et  al 2007; Yang  et al 2013; Mergler  et al 2010). Furthermore, the chronic stimulation 
of corneal and conjunctival nerves in many ocular conditions, creates a cycle of stimulus amplifications due to damage on the ocular surface, inflammation, and constant exposure of inflammatory cytokines  in the tears. This is of particular importance in regards to the highly 
innervated cornea.  
SAF312 is a highly selective and potent antagonist of TRPV1. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_359952]312 in nonclinical studies has resulted in high ocular exposure wit h relatively low systemic 
exposure, which could enable ocular pain management while avoiding known systemic side effects associated with TRPV1 antagonism  (eg, heat insensitivity, transient hyperthermia, 
autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]).  Plasma exposure of SAF312 after 4-
times daily ocular administration of 15 mg/ml (1.5%) eye drops (the highest dose to be used in this study) was very low (Day 8 Cmax (maximum of serum concentration), 0.941 ng/mL and AUC0 -24h, 15.1 ng*h/ml) and at least 100- fold and 37- fold lower than corresponding exposure 
values (Cmax, 93.9 ng/ml and AUCtau, 554 ng*h/ml) after repeated oral dosing of 12.5 mg b.i.d. where tolerability risks were not observed, yet noted at higher oral doses.   
Two clinical studies with topi[INVESTIGATOR_50016]312 eye drops, suspension (eye drops) have been 
conducted to date. One study was the first in human (FIH) study assessing the safety of SAF312 eye drops, followed by a proof of concept study for acute pain relief after PRK surgery compa red to vehicle. The safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_50016]312 eye drops has been demonstrated in 
both studies for all tested dose concentrations of 1.5 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml (0.15% up to 2.5%), no indication of delayed wound healing, and esthesiometry measurements demonstrated no anesthetic effect when compared to tetracaine 0.5% (marketed topi[INVESTIGATOR_359953]) or vehicle (as negative control). These findings are of importance to provide 
reassurance that the drug is not simply anesthetizing the ocular surface and leaving the patient 
at risk due to inhibition of the natural ocular defensive mechanisms or inhibition of corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_359954] (e.g., response to injury). Proof of concept for the efficacy of SAF312 eye drops was demonstrated with the study meeting both primary endpoints of a statistically

significant difference in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  pain severity score at [ADDRESS_448949] -
operatively, and the average of 0 -12 hour VAS between SAF312- treated eyes and Vehicle-
treated eyes. For detailed information, please refer to the IB.  
Although many patients suffer from acute ocular pain due to various causes, the treatment of 
corneal induced chronic pain remains an unmet need since there are currently no topi[INVESTIGATOR_359955]. CICP may be considered as neuropathic 
in nature, but is perpetuated by [CONTACT_359989]. It is also known that many patients with chronic pain do not necessarily describe their symptom as “pain”, and that the description can change from day to day or even within a day. Therefore, the term “pain” is used as an umbrella term which can include other symptoms the patient may describe as painful like burning, stinging, foreign body sensation, stabbing, pressure, grittiness or sandiness.  
Due to the fact that CICP is driven by [CONTACT_359990], treatment with 
a topi[INVESTIGATOR_359956] a need for chronic treatment.  
SAF312 is currently under development as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_359957] (CICP). Chronic ocular pain has been reported with the most common types of elective ocular refractive vision correction surgical procedures, Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) and Laser -assisted in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK). It has 
been reported that approximately 95% of patients experience pain immediately following LASIK or PRK surgery. Many patients have resolution of their pain within 1 month after surgery. However, up to 60% of patients continue to have chronic pain beyond 1 month, and up to 44% after 6 months; in some cases the pain will continue for many years or even permanently (Shtein  2011; Levitt et  al 2015; Benatti  and Afshari  2016). Th erefore, the pain experienced by 
[CONTACT_359991] a form of peripheral neuropathy. Similarly chronic pain may occur following other surgeries such as laser -assisted sub epi[INVESTIGATOR_359958] (LASEK), 
radial keratectomy (RK), and small i ncision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and following 
cataract surgery.  
Patients who experience CICP regardless of the cause, may have concurrent (i.e., coexisting or underlying) ocular conditions which require the use of other ocular medications to treat the concurrent condition(s) as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_102]’s physician. Because SAF312 is intended to perform as an analgesic, current treatments the patient may be using for concurrent ocular conditions will be allowed to continue, and SAF312 eye drops will be administered in addition to those current treatments. 
1.2 Purpose 
The study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of two dose concentrations of SAF312 eye drops (5 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml) in subjects with CICP persisting at least for [ADDRESS_448950] for further development.

2.[ADDRESS_448951] the interpretation of the trial results (e.g premature discontinuation of treatment). 
The primary clinical question of interest is: What is the effect of SAF312 versus placebo on 
change from baseline in pai n severity after treatment in subjects with CICP, had they not taken 
rescue or prohibited medications and had they not discontinued treatment? 
 The justification for the primary estimands is that they will capture the effect of the study drug 
for the full duration when administered without confounding effects from prohibited medications or rescue medications. Further details can be found in Section 12. 
 
The primary estimands are described by [CONTACT_6570]: 
1. Population: subjects with CICP persisting at least 4 months after refractive surgery, and 
chronicity of pain confirmed during the 3- month observation period. Further details 
about the population are provided in Section 5 . 
2. Endpoint: change from baseline in ocular pain severity VAS. The score is derived by [CONTACT_359992].  
3. Treatment of interest: the randomized treatment (SAF312 or placebo)  with or without 
treatment for any underlying ocular conditions. Further details about the investigational treatment and control treatment are provided in Section 6 . 
Handling of remaining intercurrent events (IE): 
1. Rescue medications: had subjects not taken rescue medication and behaved like other subjects who did not take them (hypothetical strategy) 
2. Prohibited medications: had subjects not taken prohibited medication and behaved like other subjects who did not take them (hypothetical strategy) 
3. Treatment dis continuation for any reasons: had patients taken the assigned treatment for 
the entire study duration and behaved like other subjects who did not discontinue treatment  (hypothetical strategy)  
 
The summary measure: difference in variable means between SAF31 2 and placebo. 
Supplementary estimands to the primary estimand are defined in Section 12 .

3 Study design  
Figure 3-1 Study Design  
 
This study is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blinded, multi -center, parallel group, placebo -
controlled evaluation of the safety and efficacy of SAF312, 5 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml eye drops 
versus placebo used twice -daily in both eyes for [ADDRESS_448952] 
undergone refractive surgery (i.e., PRK, LASIK, LASEK, RK, or SMILE) in both eyes or cataract surgery in both eyes, with or without refractive enhancement in one or both eyes at least [ADDRESS_448953] recent surgery. In cases where more than one procedure was performed on an eye (eg, refractive surgery with CICP followed some time later by [CONTACT_359993], or cataract surgery followed some time later by [CONTACT_359994]), the Screening visit must be ≥ [ADDRESS_448954] also demonstrate chronicity of the pain as described in inclusion criteria.
 Overall 
approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in the study (i.e. approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment arm in 1:1:1 ratio).  
The study will consist of a 12 week observation period starting from Screening Visit (Visit 1) until the Baseline/Randomization Visit (Visit 2). Subjects who qualify for randomization will then be asked to attend visits every two weeks for the first 4 weeks, and then monthly for the remainder of the 12 week treatment period. End of Treatment (EOT) will occur at Visit [ADDRESS_448955] study treatment. End of Study (EOS) will occur 4 days after EOT.

Potential participants will be  required to provide written info rmed consent prior to any study-
specific Screening procedures being performed. Once informed consent is obtained subjects 
will be evaluated for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section 5 ). Final 
eligibility will be based on an assessment of the subject’s pain severity VAS prior to randomization, as well as their response to a si ngle drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_50019] (eg, 
tetracaine, proparacaine eye drops per clinical pr actice). Response to anesthetic is defined as a 
UHGXFWLRQLQRFXODUSDLQZLWKLQPLQXWHVDIWHULQVWLOODW LRQRIWKHDQHVWKHWLFGURS7KH
use of the anesthetic test is necessary for the selection of subjects with a primarily peripheral neuropathic type pain (i.e., primarily resulting from stimulation of the peripheral nerves) versus a purely central neuropathic pain. Subjects with a primarily central neuropathic pain are unlikely 
to experience significant improvement with a topi [INVESTIGATOR_359959]. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 2, will be randomized to one of the three 
treatment groups (SAF312 5 mg/ml, SAF312 15 mg/ml,  placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will 
visit the study site for assessments as outlin ed in the visit assessment schedule (see Table 8-1 ). 
All subjects will be allowed to continue their current treatment regimen for any underlying or 
unrelated ocular condition if applicable (eg, treatment for glaucoma, dry eye) as long as 
eligibility criteria are met. No new treatments can be initiated once the subject has begun participation in the study unless additional treatments are needed for proper management of an 
adverse event. Whenever topi[INVESTIGATOR_359960] (IMP) are administered, the subject s hould first dose with their concomitant 
medication(s) and wait approximately [ADDRESS_448956] for further development. 
The active and placebo IMPs will be presented in identical packaging to ensure no bias to the 
study results due to knowledge of the treatment assignment. Due to  the difference in appearance 
of SAF312 eye drops vs placebo eye drops (milky white vs clear, respec tively), sites will be 
required to have an unblinded staff member to manage drug dispensation, drug accountability, 
as well as collection of adverse events or s ubject reports of product comments/complaints. All 
other site staff and Sponsor staff will be blinde d to treatment assignments. To ensure masking 
of subjects to their treatment assignment, no subject will receive both placebo and active 
treatment so no change in appearance of the test article will be noticeable by a particular subject. 
Subjects may be informed that their study trea tment may appear cloudy or white, but must not 
be informed about the specific identity of the treatments based on differences in appearance. 
A 12-week observation period prior to randomiza tion is included as a method to confirm the 
chronicity of their ocular pain, observe tr ends in the subject’s pain occurrences (  
), and to observe behaviors with ar tificial tears and rescue medications 
prior to receiving randomized treatment. This observation period confirms the selection of PI
[CONTACT_76644] 24  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
appropriate subjects with chronic pain, as well as provides meaningful data  
 regarding changes induced by [CONTACT_204282]. During this observational period, 
subjects will be observed in their real -world setting with no changes to their medications or 
actions. The only requirement will be completion of eDiary data, and pain assessments. 
4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_359952]312 eye drops in non- clinical studies has resulted in high 
ocular exposure with minimal systemic exposure, which is expected to enable ocular pain 
management while avoiding systemic  side effects. In the FIH study CSAF312X2101, dose 
concentrations of 5 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml (0.5%, 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively) were administered as a single drop [ADDRESS_448957] for 7 days. A supra -therapeutic 
dose concentration of SAF312 eye drops was tested using the maximum feasible dose (MFD) of 25 mg/ml (2.5%) and administered [ADDRESS_448958] of SAF312 eye drops when compared to Tetracaine topi[INVESTIGATOR_359961]. 
In the proof- of-concept study for the treatment of acute ocular pain after PRK  (photorefractive 
keratectomy)  surgery, SAF312 at 25 mg/ml (2.5%) was administered 4 times daily (every 6 
hours) for 72 hours. SAF312 was safe and well tolerated with no notable systemic or ocular 
adverse events, and no delay in wound healing. Systemic exposure of SAF312 was confirmed to be minimal (Cmax 2.40 ng/mL on Day 4) which is consistent with the lack of observed systemic adverse events.  
An ocular PK study in rabbits was conducted to determine the tissue concentrations of SAF312 
eye drop in s elected ocular tissues and plasma following a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_359962], at four different dose concentrations of SAF312 at 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml 
and 25 mg/ml (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively). Concentrations of SAF312 in the 
cornea and conjunctiva were greater than ten times the IC
50 (estimate of the IC 90) for up to [ADDRESS_448959] -instillation (12 hours was the end of the evaluation period). There was an 
approximate dose -proportionality for increase in SAF312 area under  the curve (AUC)  and 
Cmax  in the cornea and conjunctiva, and Cmax between 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml, but less than 
dose- proportional above 10 mg/ml. There was also differentiation in exposure observed 
between 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml but no clear differentiation between 10 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml or 25 mg/ml.   
In toxicology studies completed to date, no notable adverse events were identified after 2 weeks 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_206571]. Likewise, no notable adverse in- life events were observed when 
SAF312 was administered up to a dose concentration of 25 mg/ml (2.5%) four times daily for 
13 weeks.  
Based on these data, the Phase 2 study includes dosing of SAF312 at concentrations of 5 mg/ml 
(0.5%, lowest feasible dose) and 15 mg/ml (1.5%, highest feasible dose) to ensure evaluation of the full range of possible concentrations, and evaluation of concentrations that have potential to reveal a dose response based on differentiated tissue exposure. With target tissue exposure concentrations remaining well above  the estimated IC
[ADDRESS_448960] 12 hours, b.i.d. dosing has 
been selected as the dosing frequency. 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 25  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
Twelve weeks of exposure will allow for proper assessment of: 1) the efficacy of treatment 
response, 2) the safety of prolonged TRPV1 inhibition in the eye, and 3) the sustainability of the effect of the treatment (eg, no loss of effect over time). Both eyes will be treated with the IMP. Because it is difficult for subjects to clearly delineate pain from one eye or the other, treating both eyes will avoid confounding the data with pain that may not be addressed in the eye that does not receive treatment. There have been no safety concerns identified with the use of SAF312 eye drops, and the systemic exposure via topi[INVESTIGATOR_359963], therefore dosing both eyes is not expected to pose additional safety risks to the subject. 
Because PK has already been evaluated in both the FIH and the Phase 2a PRK (PoC) studies, 
PK is not planned as part of this Phase 2 study in patients with CICP. Plasma samples may, however, b e collected ad hoc in cases of SAEs.  
4.3 Rationale for choice of control drugs (comparator/placebo) or 
combination drugs 
Currently, there is no standard of care for CICP. If pharmacological treatments are needed, treatments may include short -term off- label use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_359964], or non- steroidal anti-
inflammatory medications, or oral pain medications.  
Subjects will be allowed to continue using medications needed to treat concurrent ocular conditions. The use of placebo (vehicle) as a comparator is therefore not considered to be an undue risk to the subjects enrolled in the trial. Moreover, since there is no standard of care for the treatment of CICP, the use of placebo as a comparator will allow for the establishment of the magnitude of change in the clinical endpoints that may be seen spontaneously during treatment, and therefore provide a better estimate of the true treatment effect of SAF312. 
4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
Not applicable.  
4.5 Risks and benefits 
As of yet there i s no known benefit to receiving topi[INVESTIGATOR_50016]312 treatment for the Corneal 
Induced Chronic Pain (CICP) indication. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAF312 eye drops has been evaluated in two studies. A FIH  Phase 1 study established the  safety 
and tolerability of SAF312 eye drops when used at concentrations as high as 25 mg/mL (2.5%) up to [ADDRESS_448961] -
operative pain compared to placebo when dosed 4 times per day for 3 days. In both studies, the adverse effects observed with oral dosing of SAF312 (eg, heat insensitivity, transient hyperthermia, autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]) were not observed. Together, these data support the anticipated safety and efficacy of SAF312 eye drops for the treatment of CICP. Because there is no standard of care for CICP, and treatment options for chronic pain are limited, SAF312 may provide a novel approach to address the current unmet need for patients in need of a chronic treatment for CICP. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 26  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
Any risks to subjects in this current study may be minimized by [CONTACT_359995], as well as close monitoring by [CONTACT_5984]. 
When dosed orally, SAF312 resulted in autonomic dysreflexia in one subject with spi[INVESTIGATOR_105538]. Even though systemic exposure with SAF312 is very low with topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784], due to the severity of this potential event, patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_359965]. 
Patients will undergo certain ophthalmological procedures which are standard in clinical 
practice and ophthalmic clinical studies. The assessment of the ocular surface requires the use of fluorescein and lissamine vital dyes. As with any application of a substance to the ocular surface, the patient may have unknown hypersensitivities to the dyes. Any subject demonstrating a potential hypersensitivity reaction will receive appropriate medical care. To minimize any risks, the study and associated procedures will be carried out by [CONTACT_359996]. 
Subjects enrolled in the study will be allowed to continue any current medications they may be prescribed to treat a concurrent or underlying ocular condition which avoids any risk of worsening of those conditions due to study requirements. Although subjects may receive placebo instead of active drug, the use of placebo is not considered a risk since it is the same formulation as the IMP but without the active ingredient. If patients receive inadequate treatment of CICP  due to the use of placebo, patients will be allowed to use rescue medication 
to avoid any undue risk or suffering as a result of study requirements. 
Given the minimal systemic exposure after topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784], and the lack of safety 
findings in non- clinical o r clinical studies conducted to date, the foreseeable risks associated 
with SAF312 eye drops are considered low compared to the anticipated benefit for patients with CICP. There may be risks associated with the use of SAF312 which are unknown at this time.

subjects in approximately 30 centers. Assuming a screening failure rate of approximately 50%, approximately 300 subjects are planned to be screened.

6.1.4  Treatment duration  
Subjects will dose both eyes with their assigned treatment for 12 weeks (84 days). 
6.2 Other treatment(s) 
6.2.1  Concomitant therapy  
All medications (systemic or ocular), procedures, and significant non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_359970] (CR F). 
Artificial tears and rescue medications should only be used when needed, and should NOT be used prophylactically.  
If a subject is using other topi[INVESTIGATOR_359971], the subject should first dose with their concomitant medication(s) and wait approximately 10 minutes prior to instillation of the study medication.

However, on the discretion of the investigator, medication (local or systemic, over the counter 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 31  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
or prescription) used for pain relief will be allowed and will be specified if used for ocular or 
non-ocular pain. The data will be entered by [CONTACT_359999] (eDiary).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_448974] Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when the subject is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (Center No.) (assigned by [CONTACT_5359]) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it, so that each subject is numbered uniquely across the entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available.  
6.3.2  Treatment assignmen t, randomization  
At visit 2 after completion of the observation period, all eligible subjects will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_360000]/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subject to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for each package of study treatment to be dispensed to the subject. 
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that 
treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A subject randomization list will be prod uced by [CONTACT_6609] a validated system that automates 
the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced under the responsibility of [COMPANY_001] Global Clinical Supply (GCS) using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the study treatment. The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Office. 
Randomization will be stratified according to baseline mean pain severity over the 7 days prior 
to Baseline Visit ( ≥75mm or <75mm) .  
6.4 Treatment blinding 
Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, study monitors and Clinical Trial Team (CTT) will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods: (1) Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_131551]: unblinded site personnel will be required for initial dose administration, and discussions with subjects that may contain unblinding information (2) the identity of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_360001], labeling, and schedule of administration. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 32  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
Unblinding of the investigator may occur in the case of subj ect emergencies and at the 
conclusion of the study. 
6.5 Dose escalation and dose modification 
Investigational study treatment dose adjustments and/or interruptions are not permitted. 
6.5.1  Dose modifications  
Dose modification, adjustment and/or interruptions are not  allowed in this study. For subjects 
who do not tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, rescue medication should be used. 
If the subject is still unable to tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, the subject should 
be discontinued from the study treatment.  
6.5.[ADDRESS_448975]’s safety and the validity of the study. The subject should inform the investigator if he/she was unable for any reason to use the study treatment as required. This information should be captured in the s ource document at each visit.  
Study treatment will be packaged in droptainers for b.i.d. dosing of both eyes each day. A new droptainer will be opened daily for use during a single day. In addition to subject reported compliance, site staff will record use d versus unused bottles as support for assessment of 
treatment compliance. All study treatment dispensed and returned must be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log and returned to the Sponsor. 
6.6.[ADDRESS_448976] (AESI) that require specific treatment 
instructions. Investigators must treat adverse events as needed and according to investigator judgement. Medication used to treat adverse events (AEs) must be recorded on the appropriate CRF . 
6.6.[ADDRESS_448977], he/she must provide the requested  subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code 
for the subject. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 33  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will 
automatically inform the [COMPANY_001] study monitor for the site and the study team that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to 
allow access to the IRT at any time in case of emergency. The investigator will ensure appropriate site personnel are available as his/her backup if needed. Investigators will also ensure subjects are provided the appropriate contact [CONTACT_122275].  
Once the treatm ent code has been broken for a particular subject, that subject must be 
discontinued from study treatment, while adverse event (AE) treatment and follow -up continue 
as appropriate.  
6.7 Preparation and dispensation 
Each study site will be supplied with study drug in packaging as described under investigational and control drugs ( Section 6.1.1).  
A unique medication number is printed on the study medication label. 
Investigator staff will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by [CONTACT_37246](s). The study medication has a 2- part label (base 
plus tear -off label), immediately before dispensing the medica tion kit to the subject, site 
personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document. 
An unblinded site personnel will instruct the subject on proper drug storage and use, and will 
dispense the assigned medication to the subject, prior to instillation of the first dose of study 
medication at the site.  
As per Section  4.6, during a Public Health emergency as declared by [CONTACT_360002] i.e. pandemic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_6519], that limits or prevents on- site study visits, 
delivery of IMP directly to a subject's home may be permitted (if allowed by [CONTACT_360003] a ppropriate) in the event the Investigator has 
decided that an on- site visit by [CONTACT_360004], and that it is in 
the interest of the subject's health to administer the study treatment even without performing an on-site vis it. The dispatch of IMP from the site to the subject’s home remains under the 
accountability of the Investigator. Each shipment/provisioning will be for a maximum of 1 month supply. In this case, regular phone calls or virtual contacts (e.g., every 2 weeks  or more 
frequently if needed) will occur between the site and the subject for instructional purposes, safety monitoring, investigation of any adverse events, ensuring subjects continue to benefit from treatment, and discussion of the subject's health stat us until the subjects can resume visits 
at the study site.  
6.7.1  Handling of study treatment and additional treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of study treatment  
Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 34  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
site personnel have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the 
instructions specified on the labels and in the Investigator’s Brochure. Clinical suppl ies are to 
be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective [COMPANY_001] CO Quality Assurance. 
Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each 
country. They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the subject except for the medication number . 
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by [CONTACT_360005]. Subjects will be asked to return all used and unused study treatment and packaging at each returning visit and at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. 
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate, during the course of the study, the 
investigator will return all used and unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a c opy 
of the completed drug accountability log to the [COMPANY_001] study monitor or to the [COMPANY_001] address provided in the investigator folder at each site.

Not applicable 
7 Informed consent procedures  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing (witnessed, where required 
by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC-approved informed consent. 
If applicable, in cases where the subject's representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according 
to local requirements), the  subject must be informed about the study to the extent possible given 
his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate agreement by [CONTACT_30803]. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study- specific procedures (i.e., all of 
the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be 
documented in the subject source documents. 
[COMPANY_001] will provide to investigators in a  separate document a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_6619]/IEC. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safety profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification (IN) 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 35  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
or an aggregate safety finding. New information might require an update to the informed 
consent and then must be discussed with the subject. 
A copy of the approved version of all consent  forms must be provided to [COMPANY_001] after IRB/IEC 
approval. As per Section  4.6, during a Public Health emergency as declared by [CONTACT_6620] i.e., pandemic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_6519], that may challenge the ability to obtain 
a standard written informed consent due to limits that prevent an on- site visit, Investigator may 
conduct the informed consent discussion remotely (e.g., telephone, videoconference) if allowable by a local Health Authority. 
Guidance issued by [CONTACT_360006], prevail and must be implemented 
and appropriately documented (e.g., the presence of an impartial witness, sign/dating separate ICFs by [CONTACT_360007] d person obtaining informed consent, etc.). 
8 Visit schedule and assessments  
Assessment schedule ( Table 8 -1) lists all the assessments and when they are performed. All 
data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentation.  
Subjects should be seen for all visits/assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule (Table 8 -1) or as close to the designated day/time as possible, and follow the proposed in-
office assessment sequence as outline in ( Table 8 -2) . Missed or rescheduled visits should not 
lead to automatic discontinuation. Visits that occur after the rescheduling of a previous visit should be done based on the initial protocol visit timing, and not based on the previous visit. 
If the EOS follow -up contact [CONTACT_360008] (EOT+4 days), the contact [CONTACT_360009], but should not be made earlier (i.e., at least [ADDRESS_448978]).  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study, for any reason, should be scheduled f or a visit 
as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be 
performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled, and the AE and concomitant medications recorded on the CRF. 
Subjects should avoid dosing with any topi[INVESTIGATOR_359974] 4 hours of a scheduled visit. 
If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on -site study visits, in which IMP could not be 
dispensed and other study assessments may not be performed, alternative methods of IMP 
dispensing and safety monitoring may be implemented. Depending on local regulations, site capabilities and patient’s visit status in the study, phone calls or virtual contacts (e.g. teleconsult) can be perfo rmed for safety follow -up for the duration of the pandemic, until it is safe for the 
subject to visit the site again.

Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
8.1 Screening 
Subjects will be screened at the Screening Visit (Visit 1), and eligible subjects will be enrolled 
into the observational period of the study. 
Re-screening of subjects who fail entry criteria for any reason is permitted only under select 
circumstances as outlined below.  
• Screen failure due to stabilization timeframes: If it is determined prior to the completion of 
Screening Visit that the subject did not meet eligibility pertaining to any of the following: 
o < 4 months since the surgical procedure (Inclusion #2a), 
o Timeframe required for stabilization of chronic medications or medical history 
(Exclusion #1a, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 20a), or 
o Time window required for ocular medication or pain medication use prior to the screening visit (Exclusion #2), 
the subject will be screen failed and may be brought back at a later date  after the proper 
timeframes have been achieved  to re -attempt the screening process.  
• Screen failure under protocol version [ADDRESS_448984] been met under protocol version 03: If a subject was screen failed under 
protocol version 02 due to the following pain severity inclusion criteria: 
o Ocular pain severity VAS < 50 mm at Screening Visit (per Inclusion #3) 
the subject may be brought back at a later date to re- attempt the screening process.  
• Screen failure due to insufficient reduction in ocular pain during the anesthetic test caused 
by [CONTACT_360013] : If a subject was screen failed due to a n insufficient 
ocular pain reduction during the anesthetic test , the subject may be al lowed to re-screen in 
specific circumstances ( including device malfunction, procedur al errors ). In all cases, t he 
site must receive Sponsor approval prior to re- screening.  
In the case of re -screening, the subject will receive a new subject number and all screening 
assessments required at Screening Visit must be completed, regardless whether the assessments 
were conducted at the previous screening visit.  
Re-screening is only allowed one time for each subject, with the exception of subjects who 
screen failed due to pain severity eligibility criteria under protocol version 02. A subject who 
screen failed under this criterion potentially could be re -screened a second time based on the 
additional re -screening criteria stated above.  Re-screening must not be used as a method to force 
subject eligibility into the study.   
 
8.1.1  Information to be collected on screening failures  
Subjects who sign an informed consent form and are subsequently found to be ineligible prior 
to randomization will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure should be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The informed consent, demographic information, and Inclusion/Exclusion pages must also be completed for screen failure subjects. No other data 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 41  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
will be entered into the clinical database for subjects who are screen failures, unless the subject 
experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) during the screening phase (see 10.1.2 SAE section

8.3 Efficacy 
8.3.1  Pain Severity and Frequency Visual Analog Scales  
The pain severity Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  is to be completed through an electronic diary 
by [CONTACT_360014], and thereafter every evening (before bed during the 
observational period, and before their evening dose of study medication during the study treatment period). The subject will provide a score for severity of their ocular pain over the past 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 42  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
24 hours by [CONTACT_82045] a vertical mark on the horizontal scoring line. The severity scoring line 
utilizes the anchors of 'No Pain' to 'Very Severe' pain.  
The Pain Frequency Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  is to be completed through an electronic 
diary by [CONTACT_360014], and thereafter every evening (before bed during the 
observational period, and before their evening dose of study medication during the study treatment period). The subject will provide a score for frequency of their ocular pain over the past 24 hours by [CONTACT_82045] a vertical mark on the horizontal scoring line. The frequency scoring line utilizes the anchors of 'Rarely' to 'All the Time'.  
8.3.2  OPAS questionnaire  
The Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) questionnaire is completed electronically  by [CONTACT_360015]. The OPAS  will be used 
to assess the subject's ocular pain, aggravating factors, quality of life, and perception of overall improvement of ocular and non-ocular pain. The OPAS is a multidimensional tool specifically designed to assess ocular pain in subjects with eye pain of any origin.

requirements and the test results will be recorded in the source document. A positive urine pregnancy test requires immediate interruption of study drug until serum beta -human chorionic 
gonadotropin (B -hCG) is performed and found to be negative. If positive, the subject must be 
discontinued from the trial. 
8.4.3  Visual Acuity  
Visual acuity (VA) will be performed using a Snellen chart. VA testing should precede IOP 
measurement, the administration of eye drops to dilate or anesthetize the eye, or any 
examination requiring contact [CONTACT_222199]. 
8.4.4  Slit Lamp Examination  
At every scheduled visit, the anterior segment’s structures of the study eye will be carefully 
examined according to clinical practice. The slit lamp results will be recorded in the source documents.  
8.4.5  Intraocular Pressure  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured according to the  standard clinical practice and 
expressed in mmHg. Every effort should be made to use the same method/instrument 
throughout the study.  
If using Goldmann applination tonometry, the IOP measurement should be performed after 
the corneal fluorescein staining and lissamine conjunctival staining at Visit [ADDRESS_448988] use the specified brand of equipment for use on all subjects at the site. 
Certification of the equipment and examiners at each investigative site will occur prior to evaluation of study subjects. At the Baseline and End of Treatment Visits Specular microscopy of the corneal endothelial cell images will be obta ined by [CONTACT_360016] (CRC) to determine the changes in endothelial cell count, density, and shape from the initial baseline to the end of treatment. A standardized procedure for the collection of the Specular  microscopy images will be provided by [CONTACT_360017] a separate manual.

corneal nerve morphology in patients with CICP. 
The following ocular surface assessments (corneal and conjunctival staining, conjunctival 
redness, Schirmer’s test)  are included to evaluate whether long term inhibition of TRPV1 
receptors with SAF312 eye drops has an adverse effect on ocular surface parameters.  
 
  
Finally, the Pain Characterization questionnaire will be used to gain greater detail regarding the subject's ocular pain. 
Frequency of artificial tear/gel/lubricant use and rescue medication use will be captured in the 
eDiary on a daily basis to gain insights to subject behavior with these products. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   In Vivo Confocal Microscopy  
In Vivo Confocal Microscopy (IVCM) will be performed by [CONTACT_737] s only at selected 
sites for exploratory analysis. The images will be sent to an independent reader for objective 
and subjective evaluation to quantify and evaluate the distribution and morphology of corneal nerves. A standardized procedure for the collection of the images will be provided in a separate manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Conjunctival Redness  
Redness of the interpalpebral conjunctiva will be evaluated by [CONTACT_360018] ( Figure 8-1).  The inter -palpebral region of the  temporal and nasal regions 
will each be graded using the 0- 5 scale.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Corneal Fluore scein Staining  
Corneal fluorescein staining will be conducted by [CONTACT_737]. For individual subjects, 
corneal fluorescein staining should be assessed by [CONTACT_360019].  
Fluorescein impregnated strips (to be provided by [CONTACT_5343]) will be used to deliver dye to the ocular surface. To wet the strip, a single drop of sterile saline solution (or similar) is placed on the tip of the strip.  Anesthetic drops must NOT be used as a wetting agent.  
Immediately after application of the wetting drop, the strip should be gently flicked to remove excess fluid. Immediately after flicking the strip, the wet tip of the strip is allowed to gently touch the inner edge of the inferior cul -de-sac of the eye to draw the fluorescein onto the ocular 
surface. The subject should be instructed to not rub their eyes and gently blink several times to distribute the dye across the ocular surface. 
The degree of staining is based on the Corneal Fluorescein Modified NEI Sca le. Each of the 
five regions (as depi[INVESTIGATOR_359978], and defined as central (C), superior (S), inferior (I), 
temporal (T), and nasal (N)) will be graded based on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores suggestive of higher degrees of corneal staining ( Figure 8-2 ). The examiner will indicate the 
appropriate score for each region. If the assessment falls between grades, round up to the higher score. After entry of the scores per region, the total or composite (sum) score for each eye will be automatically calculated (maximum score = 20/eye).

Lissamine impregnated strips (to be provided by [CONTACT_5343]) will be used to deliver the dye to the 
ocular surface. To wet the strip, a single drop of sterile saline solution (or similar) is placed on the tip of the strip. Anesthetic drops must NOT be used as a wetting agent. 
Immediately after application of the wetting drop, the strip should be gently flicked to remove 
excess fluid. Immediately after flicking the strip, the wet tip of the strip is allowed to gently touch the inner  edge of the inferior cul -de-sac of the eye to draw the lissamine onto the ocular 
surface. The subject should be instructed to not rub their eyes and gently blink several times to distribute the dye across the ocular surface.  
The degree of lissamine stain ing in the temporal and nasal inter -palpebral conjunctiva will be 
assessed based on the proportion of the area that is covered by [INVESTIGATOR_23053]. The proportion of 
staining area will be assessed based on the table provided in Table 8 -3: 
Table 8-3 Grading of Conjunctival Staining   
Grading scale  Percentage of the staini ng area  
0 0% 
1 1%–15% 
2 16%–30% 
 3 31%–45% 
4 >45%  
The score for nasal and temporal regions will be captured separately and the total conjunctival lissamine staining will be the sum of the nasal and temporal scores (total score of 0 -8). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Schirmer's Test (without anesthesia)  
The Schirmer’s test will be performed without anesthetic in both eyes simultaneously, and after completion of ocular surface stainings. 
The subject should be seated in the examining chair with the room lights dimmed and their head 
against a headrest for comfort. Prepare the sterile strips (Tear Flo ™ or similar) while they are 
still in the package by [CONTACT_360021] (approximately 5 mm from 
the tip). The strip will be bent and inserted between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva over the inferior lid margin in the lateral third of the eyelid towards the lateral canthus, and left in 
place for 5 minutes with the eyes closed. Tear secretion is measured in millimeters of the length 
of strip wetted b y tears. The measurement (score) will be made to the nearest whole number.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mitigation of Placebo Response Training Video and Pain Assessment Knowledge Check  
At Screening Visit (Visit 1):  Upon completion of ICF but before starting the use of ePRO device, the subject will use the study tablet device, personal mobile device, laptop, or tablet to watch a video regarding placebo response mitigation.  
After completing the video, a printed copy of the Pain Assessment Knowledge Check will be 
given to the subject to have him/her complete the questions in order to check their level of 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 47 
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)  Protocol No. CSAF312B12201 
 
understanding of the video content. Site staff s hould review the responses with the subject and 
answer any questions they may have regarding inco rrect responses or the in formation as a whole. 
At Baseline/Randomization Visit (V isit 2): if the subject meets criteria for randomization, the 
study subject is expected to watch the Video once more BEFORE they leave the clinic. The 
Pain Assessment Knowledge Check can be opti onal for any subject who had completed the 
Knowledge Check already during Visit 1 (Screening). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pain Character ization Questionnaire 
The Pain Characterization questionnaire is a series  of questions asking abou t the specific details 
of the subject's ocular pain (e .g., pain descriptors, timing throughout the day) that is not already 
captured in the other questionnaires include d in the efficacy assessments. The pain 
characterization questionnaire will be collected electronically at Screening Visit only and therefore not intended for any safety or efficacy assessments. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-Anesthetic Severity of Eye Pain 
The anesthetic test will be administered to identify subjects with primarily peripheral 
neuropathic pain.  
The subject will be asked to complete the pre-anesthetic pain severity VAS question in the 
ePRO. After the subject records the pain severity  score, one drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_359979] y site standard prac tice (e.g., Tetracaine,

[ADDRESS_448992] occurs when study treatment is permanently 
stopped for any reason (prior to the planned completion of study drug administration, if any) 
and can be initiated by [CONTACT_332023]. 
The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given subject if, he/she believes that 
continuation would negati vely impact the subject's well-being. 
Discontinuation from study treatment is required under the following circumstances: 
• Subject decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Use of prohibited treatment as per recommendations in the prohibited treatment ( Section 
6.2.2) 
• Any situation in which continued study participation might result in a safety risk to the 
subject  
• Following emergency unblinding 
• Adverse events  
• Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect  
If discontinuation from study treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort 
to understand the primary reason for the subject’s discontinuation from study treatment and record this information. 
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment  agree to return  for the end of treatment and 
follow-up visits  indicated  in the Assessment Schedule (refer to Section 8 ). 
If the subject cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular 
telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], or with a person pre -designated by [CONTACT_423]. This 
telephone contact [CONTACT_6636]. 
After discontinuation from study treatment, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following 
data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact:  
• New / concomitant treatments  
• AE / SAE  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 49  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
The investigator must also contact [CONTACT_37284]’s discontinuation from study 
treatment.  
If discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Emergency breaking of treatment code in Section 6.6.3.

diligence has been completed or until the end of the study. 
9.2 Withdrawal of informed consent/Opposition to use 
data/biological samples   
Withdrawal of consent/opposition to use data/biological samples occurs when a subject: 
• Explicitly requests to stop use of their biological samples and/or data (opposition to use 
subject’s data and biological samples)  
and 
• No longer wishes to receive study treatment 
and 
• Does not want any further visits or assessments (including further study- related contacts)  
This request should be in writing (depending on local regulations) and recorded in the source documentation. 
In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw their consent/opposition 
to use data/biological samples and record this information. 
Where consent to the use of Personal and Coded Data is not required in a certain country's legal 
framework, the subject t herefore cannot withdraw consent. However, they still retain the right 
to object to the further collection or use of their Personal Data. 
Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that 
would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.

If the subject agrees, a final evaluation at the time of the subject’s withdrawal of 
consen t/opposition to use data/biological samples should be made as detailed in the assessment 
table (refer to Section  8). 
[COMPANY_001] will continue to retain and use all research results (data) that ha ve already been 
collected for the study evaluation, including processing of biological samples that has already started at time of consent withdrawal/opposition. No new Personal Data (including biological samples) will be collected following withdrawal of consent/opposition.

9.4 Early study termination by [CONTACT_131360].  
Reasons for early termination:  
• Unexpected, significant, or unacceptable safety risk to subjects enrolled in the study 
• Decision based on recommendations from applicable board(s) after review of safety and 
efficacy data  
• Discontinuation of study drug development 
In taking the decision to terminate, [COMPANY_001] will always consider subject welfare and safety. Should early termination be necessary, subjects must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a subject who discontinued from study treatment: The i nvestigator should contact [CONTACT_360022], when the subject should stop taking drug, when the subject should come in for a final visit(s) that the safety follow up period must be completed if applicable and which visits to be performed. . The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be 
followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on local regulation will be responsible for  
informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial.

[ADDRESS_448996] medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and unintended sign 
[including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of  a 
medicinal (investigational) product. 
The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and 
identifying adverse events. 
[COMPANY_001] qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical 
questions or problems. 
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
[CONTACT_109049], laboratory test findings, or other assessments. 
Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_6644] (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2):  
1. The severity grade 
mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
severe: prevents normal activities  
2. Its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assess ment of causality 
will usually be ‘Not suspected.’ The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness are not caused by [CONTACT_6645], they happen in spi[INVESTIGATOR_6532]/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underlying disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by [CONTACT_6646], not on a single subject 
3. Its duration (start and end dates or ongoing) and the outcome must be reported 
4. Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which 
seriousness criteria have been met  
5. Action taken with study treatment 
All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may incl ude one or more of the 
following: 
• Dose not changed 
• Dose Reduced/increased  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 52  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
• Drug interrupted/permanently discontinued 
6. its outcome  
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in 
medical history of the subject.  
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. 
 
Adverse event monitoring should be continued until the end of study vi sit. 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be 
permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the 
Investigator's Brochure (IB). 
10.1.2  Serious adverse events 
An SAE is defined as any  AE [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing)] undesirable 
sign(s), symptom(s), or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following criteria: 
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the ICH -E2D Guidelines). 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deteriorati on in condition 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
• social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general condition 
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
• is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359980] 53  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be 
considered as “medically significant.” Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6536]  (please refer to the ICH -
E2D Guidelines). 
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met . 
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_448997] be reported to [COMPANY_001]  safety immediately, without undue delay, under no circumstances later than within 24 
hours of learning of its occurrence. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the eSAE with paper back. Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. 
All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of 
the initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537] -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_30755] [ADDRESS_448998] be reported separately as a new event.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a CMO & PS Department 
associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. [COMPANY_001]  may need to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators 
involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to 
the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with European Union (EU) Guidance 2011/C 172/[ADDRESS_448999] be given adequate time to read, review and sign the pregnancy consent form. This consent form is 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 54  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
necessary to allow the investigator to collect and report information regarding the pregnancy. 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or materna l 
and/or newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by [CONTACT_37288] (CMO&PS). Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same 
form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship between the use of SAF312 eye drops and any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported. 
If a female partner of a male trial subject who took study treatment in this study becomes 
pregnant, pregnancy outcomes should be collected. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. 
After consent is provided, the pregnancy reporting will occur up to one year after the estimated 
date of delivery. 
10.1.5  Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse  
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or consumer (European Medicines Agency (EMA) definition). 
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the protocol. 
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584]. 
Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be recorded on 
the appropriate CRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associated with an SAE (see Table 10 -1). Misuse or abuse will be collected and 
reported in the safety database within 24 hours of Investigator’s awareness only if it is associated with an SAE.

11.2 Database management and quality control 
[COMPANY_001] per sonnel will review the data entered by [CONTACT_360023]. Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary changes to the data.  
Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical history/current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA) 
terminology. 
Randomization codes and data about all study treatment (s) dispensed to the subject and all 
dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage th e database. The data will be sent 
electronically to [COMPANY_001] at specific timelines.  
Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and study monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or  upon request of 
[COMPANY_001]. 
Once all the necessary actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be 
complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 56  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after 
written agreement by [CONTACT_188660]. 
11.3 Site monitoring 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] representative will review the protocol  and data capture requirements (i.e. eCRFs) with the 
investigators and their staff. During the study, [COMPANY_001] employs several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The study  monitor will visit the s ite to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture / 
data entry, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the study  monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized [COMPANY_001]/Clinical Research Associate (CRA) organization. Additionally, a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to [COMPANY_001] clinical teams to assist with trial oversight.  
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All infor mation on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed copy is given to the subject). 
The investigator must give the study monitor  access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require 
full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, docu mentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. 
Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study- specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity 
of the subjects will be disclosed. 
12 Data analysis and statistical methods 
Any data analysis carried out independently by [CONTACT_30817]. 
12.1 Analysis sets  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) co mprises all subjects to whom study treatment has been assigned 
by [CONTACT_17628]. According to the intent to treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment and strata they have been assigned to during the randomization procedure. 
The Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects 
will be analyzed according to the study treatment received , where treatment received is defined 
as the randomized treatment if the subject took at least one dose o f that treatment or the first 
treatment received if the randomized treatment was never received.

12.4 Analysis of supporting primary objectives 
The analysis of the primary endpoints will be based on FAS.  
12.4.1  Definition of primary endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in weekly mean pain severity VAS at Week 
12. The weekly mean pain severity VAS will be calculated as the mean of the daily pain severity VAS from the [ADDRESS_449002] one SAF312 arm will improve weekly 
mean pain severity VAS in comparison with its placebo by [CONTACT_359986] a significance level α=0.05 (2-sided).

T=uv  vs. H2: u T≠uv 
where u T and uv are mean change from baseline of weekly mean pain severity VAS at Week [ADDRESS_449003] overall type I error (0.05) among the compa risons 
between each SAF312 arm and the placebo arm.   
Mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis will be used with change from baseline at 
each week on treatment as response variable, and treatment, week, and baseline score as covariates. Two interaction term (treatment*week and baseline*week) will also be included in 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 58  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
the model. An unstructured within subject correlation structure will be used for covariance 
matrix. The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degree of 
freedom. REML (residual/restricted maximum likelihood) method will be used to estimate parameters.   
The two -sided p value for the least square mean (LSM) difference between the SAF312 and the 
placebo group at each week will be reported for the difference.  
12.4.[ADDRESS_449004] placebo, 
had subjects not taken prohibited or rescue medications as described below, and had they stayed on the study treatment for the whole study duration. The hypothetical strategy assumes the 
subjects with Intercurrent events (IEs) will behave like other subjects who did not take rescue/prohibited medications and stayed on study treatment.  
For subjects who use rescue medications for pain relief due to any reason, the data on the d ay(s) 
will be excluded and treated as missing.   For subjects who take the following prohibited medications: 
• Ocular, nasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroids  
• Use of oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_359981], mast cell stabilizers  
The data on the day(s) + [ADDRESS_449005] day of these prohibited medications will be 
excluded and treated as missing.  
For subjects with new use or changes in dosing of neuromodulators for any reason or topi[INVESTIGATOR_359982], the data starting from the day will be excluded a nd treated as missing.  
For subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason, the data collected following the treatment discontinuation will be excluded and treated as missing.  Missing data after study 
treatment discontinuation will be based on the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption. 
The multiple imputations will be carried out on the weekly mean pain severity VAS.  
12.4.4  
Handling of missing values not related to intercurrent event  
The primary MMRM model implicitly imputes missing data under a MAR assump tion. 
Handling of missing daily pain severity values within a week (within- week imputation)  
The weekly mean of the seven 24- hour average pain severity assessments will be calculated 
based on the available assessments. If only one measurement is available, the mean will be 
based on that value. 
Handling of missing weekly mean pain score values (weekly mean imputation) For all analyses, imputation of intermittent missing observations before treatment 
discontinuation will be carried out following a M AR mechanism for all treatment arms.  
12.4.5  Sensitivity analyses for primary endpoint/estimand  
Not applicable.

12.4.[ADDRESS_449006] is: What is the effect of SAF312 versus placebo 
on change from baseline in weekly  mean  pain  severity  VAS  score, regardless of 
discontinuation from study treatment discontinuations  for any reason, and regardless of 
occasional  use of rescue medication or prohibited m edications ?  
The supplementary analyses to the primary analysis will be performed on the FAS population.  
The supplementary analysis will be performed using all observed data regardless of  intercurrent 
events (a treatment policy strategy). The target population, the primary variable and the summary measure of the supplementary estimand for the supplementary estimand are the same as for the primary estimand. Differently from the primary estimand, this analysis considers all intercurrent events are inherent in  the treatment regimen and will not exclude any observed data 
even when subjects take rescue/prohibited medications or discontinue treatment.  
For subjects who use rescue medications for pain relief due to any reason, all observed data will 
be used for analysis. If not available, missing data will be under the MAR assumption for both 
SAF312 and placebo arms.  
For subjects who take the following prohibited medications: 
• Ocular, nasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroids  
• Use of oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_359981], mast cell stabilizers  
All observed data will be used for analysis. If not available, missing data on the day(s) +3 
days of the IEs will be under the MAR assumption for both SAF312 arms and  placebo arm.  
 
For subjects with new use or change in dosing of neuromodulators for any reason or topi[INVESTIGATOR_359983], all observed data will be used for analysis.  If not available, missing data on the days of IEs will be under the MAR assumption for both SAF312 and placebo arms.  
 
For subjects who discontinue from study treatment due to any reason, retrieved drop-out 
(RDO) data collected after study treatment discontinuation will be used for analysis. If not available, missing data after treatment discontinuation will be multiply imputed based on Jump to Reference assumption for SAF312 arms and under the MAR assumption for  placebo arm.  
The supplementary analysis will be performed using MMRM but includes all the observed 
data and imputed data if appropriate. 
Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints will be outlined in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).  
12.5 Analysis supporting secondary objectives 
For secondary endpoints: 
• Change from baseline in pain severity Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  at Day 7 and Day 14 
• Change from baseline to Week 12 in pain frequency VAS 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 60  
Clinical Trial Protocol (Version No. 03)   Protocol No. CSAF312B12201  
 
• Change from baseline in OPAS subscale Quality of Life at Week 12 
• Change from baseline to Week 12 in ocular surface parameters (corneal staining score, 
conjunctival staining score, Schirmer score, conjunctival redness score)  
Summary statistics  (mean, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum, the number of non- missing observations, and 95% confidence interval) 
by [CONTACT_117720]. 95% confidence interval will be provided for the difference 
between the SAF312 arm vs. placebo for pain severity VAS, pain frequency VAS, and OPAS subscale Quality of Life.  
12.5.1  Safety endpoints  
For all safety analyses, the safety set will be used. The safety assessments are adverse events (ocular and non- ocular),  slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOP, visual acuity, ophthalmoscopy, and  
corneal endothelial cells evaluations.  All listings and tables will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Safety summaries (tables, figures) include only data from the on- treatment period with the 
exception of baseline data which will also be summarized where appropriate (e.g. change from baseline summaries). In addition, a separate summary for death including on treatment and post treatment deaths will be provide d. In particular, summary tables for adverse events (AEs) will 
summarize only on- treatment events, with a start date during the on -treatment period 
(treatment -emergent AEs).  
The on- treatment period starts from the date of the first administration of study treatment to [ADDRESS_449007].  
The number (and percentage) of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events (events started after the first  dose of study medication or events present prior to start of double -blind treatment 
but increased in severity based on preferred term) will be summarized in the following ways: 
• by [CONTACT_3148], primary system organ class and preferred term. 
• by [CONTACT_3148], primary system organ class, preferred term and maximum severity. 
• by [CONTACT_3148], Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) and preferred term. 
Ocular and non- ocular  adverse events  will be summarized  separately. Separate summaries will 
be provided for study treatment related adverse events, death, SAE, other significant adverse 
events leading to discontinuation. 
Subject listings of all adverse events will be provided. Deaths and other serious or clinically 
significant non- fatal adverse events will be listed separately. A s ubject with multiple adverse 
events within a primary system organ class is only counted once towards the total of the primary system organ class.

Assuming a true treatment difference in change from baseline in weekly mean pain severity 
VAS of 15 mm and a SD of 23 mm, a sample size of 50 subjects per arm provides approximat ely 
83% power that the primary analysis will be statistically significant at the two -sided 5% 
significance level adjusted by [ADDRESS_449009] a significant difference from placebo under different 
assumed treatment effects and SD with N = 50 pts/arm

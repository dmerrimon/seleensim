Study center(s):  
Estimated 18-20 study sites  
Phase of d evelopment:  
Phase 3  
Planned study period:  
Each patient wi ll participate in the initial part of the study for approximately 9 months, which 
may be followed by [CONTACT_386292]:  
To evaluate the efficacy of TET A 4HCl compared to penicillamine.  
The safety of TETA 4HCl compared to penicillamine will also be evaluated.  
Clinical hypotheses:  
The efficacy of TETA 4HCl is not inferior to penicillamine, as assessed by [CONTACT_386293]-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC). 
TETA 4HCl is well tolerated.  
Study design:  
Multicenter, randomized, open label study with an active standard- of-care comparator.  
Stable patients who are already considered to be stable on their penicillamine chelation therapy for at least 1 year will enroll in the study and enter  the 12- week Penicillamine 
Baseline Period comprising of  a 1 month (4 weeks) run- in period followed by a 2 month (8 
weeks) evaluation period. During this time all patients will continue to take their current penicillamine under study conditions. At the end of  the Penicillamine Baseline Period , 
patients who fulfill the protocol definition of being adequately controlled and tolerating penicillamine , as confirmed by [CONTACT_201429], will be randomized 
in a 1:[ADDRESS_484089]-randomization P hase comprising of a 1 month (4 weeks ) run -in 
period for both treatment arms followed by a 5 month (20 weeks ) evaluation period.    
Scheduled study visits (clinic o r telephone) will occur at s creening /enrolment  (clinic) , Week 
4 (clinic) , Week 8 (telephone) , Week 12 (clinic) , Week 16 (clinic) , Week 20 (telephone) , 
Week 24 (clinic) , Week 28 (telephone) , Week 32 (telephone)  and Week 36 ( clinic ) – see 
figure below . For the telephone visits, the necessary lab samples will be collected directly 
from the patient . Note that the designated telephone visits are permitted to be performed at 
the clinic, but the reverse is not the case i.e. a designated c linic visit cannot be a telephone 
visit, unless circumstances arising from the Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) crisis are 
preventing the execution of planned visits at the clinic . 
Patients who successfully  complete the 24- week Post-randomization Phase of the study will 
have the opportunity to enter a n Extension P hase of maximally up to 18 months ( 72 weeks ). 
Initially  they will continue on their allocated treatment (penicillamine or TETA 4HCl) for a

CONFIDENTIAL  further 24 weeks. Thereafter patients may receive TETA 4HCl for a further 24 or 48 weeks. 
Study clinic visits will occur every 6 months (24 weeks), i.e. at Weeks 60, 84 and 108. An 
additional visit for patients who were previously allocated to the penicillamine treatment arm will occur at Week 64 ( i.e. 4 weeks after starting  to receive TETA 4HCl ).  
From protocol version 6.[ADDRESS_484090] visit, i.e.:

Version 6.0 / 27 May 2020 Page 9/72
CONFIDENTIAL  •The total daily dose in milligrams (mg) is to be the same as the patient’s current
maintenance dose of penicillamine. This will be administered as 2 divided doses for all
patients (BID).
•In the event that the total daily dose needs to be changed, this is permitted during the 4-week run -in period and  subsequently, if deemed clinically necessary  (see dose
modification criteria )
Week 12 to Week 36 (24- week Post- randomization  Phase)  
•Patients are randomized to receive TETA 4HCl or to continue to receive their current
penicillamine therapy
•For patients randomized to TETA 4HCl the total daily dose in mg of trientine base will be
the same as the patient’s total daily dose of penicillamine in mg at the end of thePenicillamine Baseline Period  at Week [ADDRESS_484096] 150 mg, administered
as 2 divided doses for all patients (BID)
•For patients randomized to penicillamine the total daily dose in mg will be the same as atthe end  of the Penicillamine Baseline  Period  at Week 12 . This will be administered as 2
divided doses for all patients (BID)
•In the event that the total daily dose needs to be changed, this is permitted during the 4-week run -in period and  subsequently, if deemed clinically necessary (see dose

Dose modification: 
The investigator may modify (increase or decrease) the total daily dose of penicillamine or TETA 4HCl by [CONTACT_990]-defined increments  if the patient is no longer fulfilling the protocol 
criteria of being adequately controlled and tolerating the chelation therapy . The investigator
’s 
decision therefore  includes  the evaluations of serum NCC, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, 
alanine transaminase (ALT) level, and any safety parameters that could warrant a change in 
dose; the investigator will also take into account other factors e.g. compliance with study 
medication . See protocol for full details.

Version 6.0 / 27 May 2020 Page 10/72
CONFIDENTIAL  Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy  measures : 
Primary:  
•Serum NCC concentration
Secondary :
•24-hour urinary copper excretion
•Clinical stability assessment by [CONTACT_386296]
•Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC ) rating scale
Other:
•Unified Wilson’s Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS), neurological  scale
•Serum total copper and serum ceruloplasmin concentrations
Safety  measures :
•Adverse events and serious adverse events
oClinically significant laboratory abnormalities and significant changes in
neurologic al signs/symptoms will be reported as AEs
•Hematology, biochemistry and coagulation analysis
•Urinalysis
•Neurologic al signs and symptoms (using the relevant UWDRS items)
•Cognitive assessment using the semantic verbal fluency test
•Modified Nazer score
•Vital s igns (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], body temperature)
•Urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential)
Pharmacokinetic measures:
•Plasma samples will be obtained at designated sites/ visits for patients who receive TETA
4HCl for subsequent pharmacokinetic evaluation of plasma concentrations of trientineand the metabolites N1 -acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N1, N10-
diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT)
Statistical methods:  
The intention- to-treat population will consist of all randomized patients.  
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, consisting of all patients who received at least one dose penicillamine in the Penicillamine Baseline Period.  
The pharmacokinetic population will be defined in a separate pharmacokinetic analysis plan. Efficacy: The primary efficacy measure of the study is serum NCC concentration. The 
absolute values at screening/enrolment, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36, will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) based general linear model for correlated data. The model will be used to test if there is a difference between the absolute values of serum NCC in the two treatment groups at Week 36. Non-inferiority of TETA 
4HCl compared to  penicillamine will be declared if the limit of the one -sided 97.5% 
confidence interval of the difference in mean serum NCC level under these two treatments excludes the non- inferiority margin . 
The same model will be  used for the repeatedly measured 24-hour urinary copper excretion 
absolute values. In addition, the proportion of patients with serum NCC levels below certain thresholds at Week 36 will be summarised as will be the proportion of patients with 24-hour urinary copper excretion above certain thresholds, as will the proportion of patients 
remaining within  the entry criteria ranges of serum NCC and urinary copper excretion.

stable. The proportion of clinically stable patients at Week 36 and at Week 60 will be 
computed and reported with their 95% confidence intervals.  
The results of the UWDRS neurological scale will also be presented, including graphical representation  e.g. within- patient shifts.  
Efficacy data for the Extension Phase will be summarized separately.  
Safety: AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred term (PT), and treatment group as the number and percentage of patients with an event. T he following 
subsets of AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]: AEs related to study treatment, severe AEs, AEs leading to treatment withdrawal and SAEs.  
Categorical endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977], continuous 
endpoints  by [CONTACT_148216].  
Safety data for penicillamine will be tabulated separately for the following 4 periods: screening/enrolment visit to Week 12 visit ( i.e. Penicillamine Baseline P eriod ), 
Week 12 visit 
+1 day  to Week 36 visit  (i.e. 24- week Post -randomization Phase) , Extension Phase  from

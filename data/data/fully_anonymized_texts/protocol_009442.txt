Project Title 
ACES – Ace Inhibitors Combined with Exercise for hypertensive Seniors  
Abstract:  
The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to determine if choice of 
antihypertensive medication influences changes in functional status and other cardiovascular risk factors 
among older persons with hypertension. Functi onal status, determined by [CONTACT_772615], is an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in older adults. Seniors with 
compromised function experience more CV events, have a higher risk of undergoing cardiac surgery and higher risk  of CVD -related death than higher -functioning peers. Seniors with hypertension experience 
accelerated declines in function, and presently physical exercise is the primary strategy for preventing this 
decline. However, functional responses to exercise are highly variable and appear to be influenced by [CONTACT_772616](s) utilized to control blood pressure. Preliminary evidence suggests 
that, compared to other first- line antihypertensive agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
enhance exercise- derived improvements in functional status among hypertensive seniors. This RCT will 
test this hypothesis. Sedentary men and women > [ADDRESS_1060749] -line antihypertensive agents: (1) the ACE inhibitor 
perindopril, (2) AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, or (3) the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. All 
participants will also participate in a structured aerobic exercise intervention. The primary aim is to determine if, compared to losartan and HCTZ, perindopril improves self- paced gait speed. The secondary 
aim is to determine the relative effect of p erindopril on a) exercise capacity, b) body mass and 
composition, and c) circulating indices of cardiovascular risk. In exploratory analyses, skeletal muscle biopsies will be collected to evaluate the influence of study drugs on indices of skeletal muscle 
angiogenesis. This study is expected to differentiate beneficial effects of three FDA -approved 
antihypertensive medications on an emerging cardiovascular risk factor in a clinically -relevant population. 
Thus the study has important implications for expeditiously influencing clinical practice guidelines in the 
prescription of antihypertensive drugs to millions of Americans.  
Background:  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002], and persons over 60 
years of age account for over 80% of deaths attributable to CVD.
1 CVD is also the second leading 
cause of disability among older adults,2an important contributor to the loss of independence and 
subsequent institutionalization. As a consequence, older adults account for nearly three-quarters of 
health care expenditures related to CVD.3 Importantly, these expenditures are expected to increase 
dramatically in coming years as the number of older adults is expected to double to approximately 80 
million in the next three decades.4 This aging of the American population predicts massi ve burden in 
terms of clinical and economic costs related to CVD.  Consequently, the identification of interventions capable of reducing CVD risk among older adults is an important goal with dramatic public health 
implications.  
The loss of functional abil ities in advanced age is associated with not only the onset of disability and 
the loss of independence but also with increased rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
5-
7Declines in self-paced walking speed, a recommended indicator of health and well -being among 
seniors,8,9 is also associated with incident stroke,10 adverse outcomes following cardiac surgery,11 as 
well as cardiovascular and all -cause mortality.6,7,12 Compared to normotensive counterparts, older 
persons with hypertension experience accelerated declines in walking speed 13,14 and increased rates 
 Page 2 of 13 
 of disability.15,16 We also observed this phenomenon in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for 
Elders Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (LIFE -P) study. Seniors with hypertension who were given a control intervention had slower 
long-distance walking speeds at baseline (p < 0.001) and experienced gait slowing that was not 
observed in normotensive persons.  
Currently, physical exercise is the standard intervention for improving physical function among older 
adults. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of exercise programs on the 
function of older adults.17-20 We also recently demonstrated the general efficacy of exercise training in 
improving the functional status of moderately -impaired seniors in LIFE -P.21 However despi[INVESTIGATOR_772600], these benefits did not 
extend to a large proportion of individuals. Improvements in functional measures observed in response 
to exercise were driven largely by [CONTACT_772617]22  – despi[INVESTIGATOR_772601]. Indeed, persons not using ACE 
inhibitors displayed relatively poor functional adaptations to exercise. 
ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure by [CONTACT_772618] I (ANG I) to 
angiotensin II (ANG II) and inhibiting the degradation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilatory substance. However, some therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors may be mediated by [CONTACT_772619]. Proposed pleiotropic effects of ACE inhibitors include reducing reactive oxygen species production, anti -inflammatory properties, and reducing myocyte 
hypertrophy and fibrosis.
23 In high risk patients enrolled in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 
(HOPE) trial, most of the benefit of ramipril compared to placebo appeared to be unrelated to blood 
pressure lowering.[ADDRESS_1060750] been purported to attenuate declines in functional status 
among seniors.29,30 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_772602]’s Health and Aging Study (WHAS) and 
the Systematic Assessment of Geriatric drug use via Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (SAGE) study indicated that, compared to non-users, seniors using A CE inhibitors displayed attenuated declines in walking speed 
and limitations in Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
31,[ADDRESS_1060751] when combined with 
exercise. We previously reported retrospective findings suggesting that older persons who took ACE 
inhibitors had greater exercise-derived improvements in functional status than non-users.22 As a result 
of these findings and other pre-clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_772603],31,35 -37 we developed 
our central hypothesis  that – compared to other first line antihypertensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] –  ACE inhibitors 
enhance functional responses to exercise among hypertensive seniors. We then conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_772604] e study 
interventions in the target population. The objective of this project is to conduct a fully -powered RCT to 
test our central hypothesis.  
Specific Aims:  
We propose to compare, when combined with chronic exercise, the effects of the ACE inhibitor 
perindopril to those of an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan) and an alternative first-line 
antihypertensive that functions independent of the renin-angiotensin system (hydrochlorothiazide). We 
will recr uit hypertensive seniors with functional limitations (N = 213) from two geographically disti nct 
sites and follow them for 32 weeks. Participants (n = 71/group) will be randomly assigned to receive, in 
a triple-masked fashion, either perindopril (dose titrated to a maximum of 8 mg/day), losartan 
(maximum 100 mg/day) or HCTZ (maximum 25 mg/day). All participants will also engage in a 20 -week 
structured exercise program (150 min/week of aerobic exercise) preceded and followed by 6-week observational periods. The specific aims are to:

Research Plan:  
We propose to conduct a randomized, triple- masked trial to evaluate the efficacy of combining physical

medications: 1) the ACE inhibitor Perindopril, 2) the ARB Losartan, or 3) the thiazide diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). All participants will also engage in a 2 0 week structured exercise 
intervention. The total intervention period will be 3 2 weeks and separated into 3 phases: Pre- exercise 
observation (weeks 1 -6), exercise intervention (weeks 7 -26), and post- exercise follow -up (weeks 27- 32).

 Explanation  
Gait speed  
(Primary)  Declining gait speed in late -life is associated with increased risk of numerous cardiovascular 
outcomes,7,10-[ADDRESS_1060755] -
effectiveness.44,45 We will assess gait speed by [CONTACT_772622] a 4 m course.  
Exercise 
Capacity  We will assess exercise capacity of participants using the six -minute (6 -min) walk test, a safe 
and reliable test of aerobic endurance in older persons and those with cardiovascular 
conditions.46,[ADDRESS_1060756] coefficients of variation 
averaging < 10%, and has a modest correlation with peak VO 2.[ADDRESS_1060757] if required.  
Body Composition  Body composition is a critical cardiovascular risk factor and a primary contributor to exercise 
capacity and overall functional status. We will assess body composition by [CONTACT_226234]-
body fat percentage (BF%) as well as central adiposity (lumbar region) using dual x -ray 
absorptiometry.  
Circulating 
indices of 
cardiovascular risk In addition to measurement of clinical safety parameters, fasting blood samples (serum or 
plasma as appropriate) will be sent to Quest Diagnostics for clinical laboratory evaluation of blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose, and hemoglobin A(1c) levels. Samples will also be assayed for prominent markers of inflammation ( e.g. TNF- α, IL-6, VCAM -1, E- selectin) and oxidative 
stress (e.g. oxidized LDL and myeloperoxidase).  Assays will be performed us ing previously -
utilized, commercially -available ELISA kits.  
EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES . Skeletal muscle biopsies will be collected at baseline and [ADDRESS_1060758] including 
mitochondrial function, inflammation, and glucose metabolism. Skeletal muscle immunohistochemistry 
(i.e. fiber typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/capi[INVESTIGATOR_772607]) will be performed as published.49 Skeletal muscle content of mRNA and 
protein related to angiogenesis –  including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor

RANDOMIZATION . Study randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_2329] a random ization scheme provided by 
[CONTACT_15282]. The randomization scheme will be concealed to investigators and study staff 
until the completion of the study. 
PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVE NTION . Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three study 
medications. Blood pressure will be controlled according to published hypertension guidelines. . 
Participants assigned to Perindopril will be given an initial dose of 4 mg/day for two weeks after which, 
pending approval of the study medical safety officer , the dose will be increased to 8 mg/day.  If the 4 
mg/day dose controls blood pressure to ≤120/≤80 or the low dose is  not tolerated due to issues such as 
hypotension, cough, or hyperk alemia, the participant will be given the lower tolerated dose. The same 
scheme will be utilized for the Losartan group (dose titrated from 50 mg/day to 100 mg/day) and the 
HCTZ group (12.5 mg/day to 25 mg/day). ***Note: Participants with a prior history of adverse 
experiences to ACE inhibitors will be randomly assigned to either Losartan or HCTZ.***  
The study clinician also has the discretion to immediately start the participant at the higher dose 
should it be warranted to safely manage the participant’s blood pressure. It is possible that participants 
may need > 1 drug to control blood pressure after receiving the full dose of study drug. In this case, 
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_772608] a good combination agent and does not cause 
bradycardia. If needed, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_772609] 2.5, 5 or, 10 mg/day. The proportion of each study 
arm requiring amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_772610]. Participants requiring additional medications to control blood pressure wil l be removed from 
the study, though we envision this scenario as unlikely based on our entry criteria and experience in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Because of the effects of HCTZ on potassium, it is also possible that some participants may 
require potassium supplementation in addition to the study medication. Serum potassium will be 
evaluated at study assessment visits and oral potassium chloride  will be prescribed for any serum potassium <3.5  mEq/L. Serum potassium will then be rechecked (in addition to regular study visits) 
every 2 -3 weeks with potassium doses increased as needed until potassium is normalized.

 If participants are interested and their primary care physician recommend continuing the assigned 
randomized study medication, the physician’s office can choose to complete the study medication 
information request form faxed directly to the site institution investigational drug service (keepi[INVESTIGATOR_772611]). On this form, the investigational drug service will 
identify the study medication and dose assigned and send it directly back to the requesting primary 
care physician office after all participation in study visits have ended in an a HIPAA -compliant manner.  
The medication disclosure would not happen until after final data collection, and participants would be 
provided with additional study drug to continue for a short period until receiving medication filled from 
their physician. 
DRUG PREPARATION . Study drugs will be provided by [CONTACT_772623]. Study drugs will be placed in standard 
prescription medication receptacles large enough to supply the drug until the next study visit. The 
receptacles will be labeled with vital study information such as  the study name, study week number, 
date of preparation, and study team contact [CONTACT_3031]. The study coordinator will communicate with the Research Pharmacy prior to each patient follow -up visit to assure uninterrupted provision of study 
drug. 
E
XERCISE INTERVENTION . In addition to taking the study drug, all participants will engage in a 20  week 
structured exercise intervention. The intervention will include twice weekly, center -based, aerobic 
exercise as well as home-based walking. This intervention is designed to achieve a total of 150 minutes 
of aerobic activity per week, meeting clinical and public health guidelines for the general public,55 older 
persons,56-58 and those with hypertension.59  
Each center -based session will begin with a bri ef warm -up followed by [CONTACT_60142]-intensity treadmill  
walking. Other forms of endurance activity (e.g., stationary cycling) may also be utilized. Participants 
will be introduced to the intervention exercises in a structured way such that they begin with lighter 
intensity and gradually increase during the first weeks of the intervention. According to ACSM/AHA 
guidelines,56 exercise intensity will be monitored using a subjective 0-10 scale for phy sical exertion 
(Borg CR10 scale).60 Participants will initially be instructed to exercise at a moderate intensity, 
equivalent to a 5-6 on the CR10 scale. During each exercise session, participants will also be asked to wear a hear t rate monitor to measure mean pulse during their sessions. Pulse measurement will allow 
interventionists to help participants with gauging the accuracy of their subjective ratings and promote 
safety. After the initial two weeks of activity, participants will be asked to exercise at a target intensity of 
70-80% of predicted maximal heart rate (220 –  age). Walking /Cycling distance and grade will also be 
monitored during each session and participants will  be encouraged to increase the distance and grade 
exercised each session. For home-based activity, participants will be encouraged to perform walking at 
a moderate intensity throughout the duration of the study. They will also be asked to wear a 
commercial ly-available fitness monitor throughout the study period to monitor home-based activity.  
S
TATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN. The primary outcome for the study will be change in 4m gait speed from 
week 6 to 26 (the exercise period) in the trial. Prior  to all analyses, the assumption of normality will be 
checked using histograms and normal probability plots. For gait speed, we will  use linear mixed effects 
models with random intercept to account for the temporal correlation among the multiple observations 
for each subject. Follow -up model -based contrast  tests will be applied to test the effect of perindopril 
compared to losartan and HCTZ. For all the secondary outcomes other than body mass and 
composition, we will fit similar linear mixed effects models as  for the primary outcome. For the body 
mass and composition measures, we will use the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  method. 
Exploratory  outcomes will also be evaluated using  ANCOVA. Corrections for multiple comparisons will 
be utilized  within (e.g., four serum inflammatory analytes) but not between (i.e., exercise capacity vs. 
body composition vs. serum analytes)  secondary and exploratory  outcomes. For all outcomes, the 
primary analysis will include data from all randomized participants, in line with intent -to-treat principles. 
A secondary analysis will be performed to evaluate changes during the full intervention period (weeks 
0–32). For  each analysis, sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the impacts of relevant 
potential confounders including age, sex, race, site, retention (i.e., drop-out), adherence (i.e., 
medication and exercise). Given that those with cough history cannot  be randomized to ACE, additional 
 Page [ADDRESS_1060762] 
to minimize adverse responses to the study drugs. Abnormal symptoms or vital  signs detected during 
intervention visits will be discussed with the s tudy physician in real time, who will dictate the appropriate 
course of action. Study staff will also inform the participant’s primary care physician of the participant’s 
initial enroll ment in the trial, as well as of all changes in medication prescription during their participation 
in the trial. Participants will be provided with a copy of the letter sent to their physician. They will also be 
provided with a wallet size card containing study details and contact [CONTACT_3031].  
In addition, subjects will be provided a home blood pressure monitor and encouraged to conduct 
daily blood pressure monitoring. We will provide participants with a home BP monitor that meets the 
standards of the British Society of Hypertension and the Association for the Advancement of the Medical Instrumentation.
62 This device utilizes a triplicate mode of measurement and averages the 
values, to closely resemble clinical measur ements. The device records and stores SBP, DBP, HR, and 
a date/time stamp which are downloadable via a computer interface. Participants will be instructed to 
take their home BP three times  daily, on rising from bed, midday  and before retiring. Participants  will be 
instructed to report any SBP > 180 or < 90 mmHg or DBP > 100 or < 60 mmHg to the study coordinator 
immediately. Those with two or more such pressures  will be scheduled immediately for a clinic visit, at 
which time it will be determined whether the patient is taking the home BP properly. Blood pressure will 
also be monitored at each assessment visit in the clinic.  Participants will be withdrawn from the study 
at the discretion of the study clinician  for any DBP > 100 mmHg or SBP > [ADDRESS_1060763] antihypertensive therapy under the supervision of their 
phys ician or referred for care.  
If study treatments according to the scheduled protocol do not manage hypertension safely, the 
study clinician  has full discretion to manage the antihypertensive regimen to ensure safety. He can be 
un-blinded to study medication randomization at any time to ensure proper care. If abnormal BP 
readings or lab values are identified, he may alter antihypertensive regimen as appropriate by [CONTACT_772624], adding other antihypertensive drugs or supplements  (e.g. 
potassium) to the drug regimen , or withdrawing the participant from the study medication and returning 
to pre-study therapy. When unblinding is required, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_772612] m edication the participant is taking directly to the cardiologist 
who will take the appropriate medical steps. In cases where the study team  learns about a serious 
adverse event or medical emergency , the study clinician  will be immediately informed. Unblinding 
procedures will be the same as described above. In cases of emergency, non-study m edical personnel 
treating the participant will also be provided with study drug and dosage information as necessary to 
ensure proper care. The participant's primar y care physician will also be notified of the emergency 
event.  
Clinical chemistry indicators – e.g.  creatinine, sodium, potassium, and urinary albumin –  will be 
also monitored at all study visits. The study clinician  can elect to replace potassium at any  value, with 
protocol mandated prescription of oral potassium chloride for any potassium <3.5  mEq/L. If adverse 
 Page 8 of 13 
 serum potassium values are noted, serum potassium will be rechecked (in addition to regular study 
visits) every [ADDRESS_1060764] or recur with further exercise. Blood 
pressure and heart rate will be measured before and after the training session  at each center. 
Physician clearance will be required prior to returning to exercise for participants experience any of the 
following during a previous exercise session: decrease in diastolic blood pressure ≥  20 mm Hg during 
the activity, increase in systolic blood pressure to ≥ 200 mm Hg or in diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm 
Hg in response to activity , increase in heart rate ≥  90% of age predicted maximum, unusual or severe 
shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], light headedness, dizziness or feeling about 
to faint, or a session had to be discontinued because of other medical symptoms, excluding 
musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., knees, ankles, hips), reported by [CONTACT_2299].  
Any significant adverse events will be reported promptly to the IRB and to the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB). Again, written informed consent will be obtained after explanation to 
subjects about all procedures and time commitments. The study interviewers will explain to prospective 
participants the purpose, methods and extent of the study. Potential participants will be asked to read 
the informed consent form and to ask questions. The form will be written in simple, easy -to-understand 
language. Staff members will also review all key aspects of the s tudy verbally. Confidentiality of data 
will be maintained by [CONTACT_102773]. Data 
will be used only in aggregate and no identifying characteristics of individuals will be published or 
presented. Finally, the study protocol has been registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT# 03295734) 
and will be updated as required. 
Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
Potential risks are those associated with health information privacy, venipuncture, treatment with the 
antihypertensive agents, radiation from DEXA, and participation in exercise training and testing.  
 Venipuncture can be associated with pain, bruising, hematoma formation, superficial phlebitis, and 
rarely cellulitis or fainting.  
 Risks of antihypertensive drug therapy include the development of symptomatic orthostatic 
hypotension, postprandial hypotension, and syncope or falls.  Specific risks of perindo pril include 
hyperkalemia, cough, headache, weakness, dizziness, diarrhea, stomach pain, and upset stomach. 
Serious, but infrequent, risks include swelling, difficulty swallowing, lightheadedness, fainting, fever, sore 
throat, and irregular heartbeats. Risks associated with losartan include dizziness, leg, knee, or back pain, 
muscle cramps or weakness, diarrhea, and heartburn. Serious but less frequent risks include swelling, difficulty breathing/swallowing, and chest pain. Risks associated with diuretics, including HCTZ, include 
electrolyte imbalances (most notably hypokalemia, but could include hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, 
and hypochloremia), increases in fasting blood glucose, muscle weakness, dizziness, cramps, extreme 
thirst, stomach pain, nausea, vomi ting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, hair loss, and gout. More 
serious risks include sore throat with fever, unusual bleeding or bruising, severe skin rash, and difficulty

Possible Benefits:  
Importantly, the proposed project will have direct, tangible benefits for participants. These benefits include 
information about their health and assessments of their functional status. All study participants will be 
encouraged to communicate the results from the study to their primary care providers. Moreover, all 
participants – regardless of randomized group –  will receive supervised exercise training and instruction 
about how to maintain exercise habits at home. We expect that these benefits will improve quality of life 
for all participants.   
Conflict of Int erest:  
There are no conflicts of interest to report.

 6 1. Background  
A. Postoperative Pain  
Pain is a psychological sensory experience that is provoked by [CONTACT_355022]. Postoperative pain results from a of combination of nociceptive and inflammatory 
components.1 The nociceptive component results from activation of peripheral sensory 
neurons damaged by [CONTACT_355023]. The 
inflammatory component enhances pain sensitivity via release of mediators from 
surgically injured tissue.  Central neuronal sensitization also seems to contribute to 
postoperative pain and hyperalgesia.1,2 Both mechanisms contribute to resting pain is in 
and around surgical incisions. Movement of wounds or touching them, breathing, 
coughing, and gastrointestin al motility can all provoke  pain.  
Postoperative pain causes a number physiological and psychological 
consequence , which potentially worsen outcomes. For example, inadequate 
perioperative analgesia is associated with myocardial ischemia, impaired wound healing, 
delayed gastrointestinal motility, atelectasis, and postoperative pneumonia.3-5 
Furthermore, poorly controlled acute pain is strongly associated with development of 
persistent incisional pain, which can be devastating for patients.6,7 
B. Postoperative pain management and Regional Analgesia  
Pain management after major abdominal surgery is difficult  and complicated . Thirty 
percent of patients report severe postoperative pain and 47% report moderate pain .8 
Furthermore, 10 -40% report  persistent  pain after abdominal and pelvic surgery .[ADDRESS_441961] lethal complication  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354935] a safety target by [CONTACT_355024][INVESTIGATOR_354936].12 Reducing perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_354937] a clinical priority .

 7 Regional Anesthesia  or analgesia  reduces  the need for high -dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Regional analgesia techniques can be categorized as neuraxial (spi[INVESTIGATOR_354938] ) that involve  injection of  local anesthetics around the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] , or as peripheral 
nerve blocks that involve local anesthetic administration near peripheral nerves. The 
basis of regional analgesia is local anesthetics which locally block voltage -gated sodium 
channels, thus interrupting nerve conductions and causing  regions to be insensitive to 
pain.[ADDRESS_441962] become popular in recent decades 
largely because improvements in ultrasound technology make blocks faster and safe r — 
and more importantly , because peripheral nerve  blocks s peed recovery and improve  
patient satisfaction.[ADDRESS_441963] -
operative analgesia for anterior abdominal wall.33 The target area of the local anesthetics 
is between the transvers abdominis and internal oblique muscle to block the spi[INVESTIGATOR_153315]  
(T6-L1). There are various type s of TAP block s, including  intercostal/subcostal, 
lateral/classical, anterior, and posterior  approaches .34 
Figure 1: [ADDRESS_441964] and sensorial distribution of loca l 
anesthetics vary.42 Four-quadrant TAP block s (Bilateral Dual) were  described by [CONTACT_355025]. and provides wider coverage  for upper - and lower -abdominal wall incisions  because 
there is no communication between upper and lateral TAP  spaces.  (Figure  1).43 Dual 
block s combin e subcostal and lateral/posterior TAP block s, thus providing complete 
coverage. Four quadrant TAP blocks should be performed to have good coverage 
especially for any incision that goes above umbilicus.  
TAP block s only provide somatic pain relief ; they therefore provide analgesia for  
surgical incision s, but not for  visceral pain . Numerous  studies show that TAP block with 
plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354939] d to unblock ed or placebo patients for  up to [ADDRESS_441965] painful postoperative days.    
D. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel; bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40470], Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, NJ [LOCATION_003])  
Exparel is the prolonged -release formulation of the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354940] a single -
shot infiltration of surgical site s or for nerve block s. Exparel was approved by [CONTACT_43747] (FDA) in 2011 for infiltration blocks , and in 2018  it received 
approval for the inters calene brachial plexus block.45 
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] d epofoam technology is based on multiple microscopic 
spherical particles with many aqueous chambers separated by [CONTACT_40562]. When 
refrigerated, the particles are stable; but after injection of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354941] , Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354920] [ADDRESS_441966] use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354942] , 
and patient were more  satisf ied and experienced fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects .48 
A systematic review  that evaluated  liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354943], 
nausea  and vomiting , and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] . However, this analysis was weakened by 
[CONTACT_355026] s and others that were  observational .49 The 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_354944] 10% of patients in liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354945]. Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_354946] d to

E. Rationale of the Study  
The recent enhancement of conventional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354949] -of-action and resulting pain control with a single 
application. TAP blocks appear to be easier to perform (especially with ultrasound 
guidance), saf er, relatively inexpensive, and can be used safely in patients who are anti -
coagulated. However, the literature is scarce on comparison of plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354950] . Some  clinicians therefore question the efficacy and 
benefit of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354951] , especially  considering the cost of 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. We therefore aim  to compare the analgesic efficacy of TAP blocks 
with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , and placebo in patients who are scheduled 
for major abdominal surgery.

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354952] [ADDRESS_441970] surgery.  
Hypothesis . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_354953] 24 hours after major abdominal surgery 
is less when four -quadrant TAP blocks are performed with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354954]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_354955]; a difference of at least [ADDRESS_441971] 24 hours will be 
considered to be a clinically mean ingful difference.   
Primary Aim 2:

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and placebo on a composite of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related postoperative side effects.  
Hypothesis.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects  over the initial 72 hours or duration of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354972] -quadrant TAP 
blocks are performed with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354968]. 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects will be evaluated as composite of events, and a difference of 
20% in incidence will be accepted as c linically important difference.  
Tertiary  Aim 2.  To compare the effect of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], conventional 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and placebo on satisfaction with their pain treatment after first 72 hours or

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354976] -quadrant TAP blocks 
are performed with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354968]. Pain 
will be assessed  on a 0 -10-point scale ([ADDRESS_441976]) at [ADDRESS_441977] 1.2 points will be considered 
clinically meaningful.   
Tertiary Aim 5. To compare the effects of TAP blocks with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], plain

C. Withdrawal Criteria   
Patients will be free to withdraw from study at any time. Patients will also be 
removed from study at any time for adverse events, or deemed necessary for patient 
safety.  
D. Protocol  
After eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive complete information about the 
study both verbally and in writing. Informed consent will be obtained from the patients 
prior to randomization and study -specific procedures.   
Randomization will be based on computer -generated codes and use random -sized  
blocks . Allocations will be concealed until the  morning of surgery  where they will be 
provided by a web -based system . Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_355027][INVESTIGATOR_2441] , defined by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_354979] 30 consecutive days  within three 
preoperative months , at a daily dose of 15 mg or more of morphine or equivalent. 
Randomization will also be stratified according to  anticipated  type of surgery (open vs. 
laparoscopic -assisted).  Clinicians doing the blocks will not be involved in data collection 
and all the evaluators will be blinded to group allocation s. 
All blocks will be performed preoperatively or after induction of anesthesia by 
[CONTACT_355028] . Premedication will be administered at the discretion of the attending 
anesthesiologist and standard monitors will be used.  Patients will be given 1 g oral 
acetaminophen an hour before surgery , and an additional  500 mg every 6 hours for 72 
hours after surgery starting with oral intake.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to:  1) 4-quadrant  TAP block with liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ; 2) 4-quadrant TAP block with plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ; or, 3) placebo (normal 
saline) . An in -plane  ultrasound will be guide  TAP block s. Two subcostal injections will be 
applied by [CONTACT_355029]. The lateral two TAP block injections will be applied in the midaxillary line between 
Comparison of  Exparel , Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354920] [ADDRESS_441979] between external oblique and transversus abdominis 
muscles.  Once the target area  is positioned , the following injections will be given, based 
on randomization:  
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . 40 ml of p lain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.25%  will be mixed with 
20 ml liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39847] 20  ml of saline .  20 ml of the mix will be injected at each 
location of the 4 -quadrant TAP block.  
Plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195] . 50 ml of p lain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0. 5% will be combined with 
30 ml of normal saline  making a total of 80 ml . 20 ml will be injected at each location of 
the 4-quadrant TAP block.  
Placebo group;  patients will receive total of [ADDRESS_441980] analgesic management as necessary in an effort to keep verbal response 
pain scores (details below) <[ADDRESS_441981] pain . When 
patients no longer need  PCA, they will be switched  to as-needed  hydromorphone or 
fentanyl.  
A single dose of dexamethasone (4 -8 mg) will be given  to all patients for PONV 
prophylaxis, and inhaled steroids will be permitted as necessary to treat reactive airway 
disease. The use of non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs  and gabapentinoids will be 
allowed as part of the ERAS approach (enhanced recovery after surgery) according to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s clinical practice . Other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing medications such as  ketamine and 
lidocaine patch es will not be permitted through the initial 72 postoperative hours.  Vital 
Comparison of  Exparel , Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354920] 10 October 1, 2021                                
 19 signs and patient activity will be continuously monitored and recorded with a wireless 
monitor (ViSi mobile, Sotera Wireless, San Diego, CA). Monitoring will be started about 
30 minutes after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit and continued for 72 hours while 
patients remained hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Clinicians w ill be blinded to continuous monitoring data; 
clinical decisions therefore will be guided by [CONTACT_355030][INVESTIGATOR_354980] 4 -hour intervals.  
Patients will be allowed to receive prophylactic anti -emetic (first choice 
ondansetron) intraoperatively based on the risk assessment for nausea and vomiting. 
Postoperative anti -emetics for symptomatic treatment will also be allowed; again 
ondansetron will  be the first choice.  
E. Measurements  
Demographic data to be obtained includes height (cm), weight (kg), age (yr), sex, 
(ASA) physical status, self -declared ethnicity, and the specific type  of procedure will be 
recorded.  Patients will be questioned about tobacco  and alcohol use, and about illegal 
drug us e. They will also be asked about their  medical history  including pulmonary 
disease, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, chronic pain conditions, 
previous surgery or stent placement , and medication s. Available preoperative laboratory 
tests and medication list will be recorded. Preoperative pain scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_354981]. Patients excluded for any reason including technical considerations or 
contraindications will be recorded.   
All the procedures for the ultrasound guided TAP blocks will be recorded to the 
ultrasound and two blinded independent adjudicators will evaluate the success of the 
blocks. Blocks will be accepted as successful if 3 out of 4 locations were done correctly 
according to adjudicators.  
 
Primary Outcome  1 
Comparison of  Exparel , Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354920] 10 October 1, 2021                                
 20 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_354982] (converted to 
morphine sulfate equivalents) used during the first [ADDRESS_441982] (determined by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_354929]) will be 
evaluated in all four quadrants. The evaluation will be made in eight locations, three in 
each side and two in midline. The first will be below the subcostal margin at midclavicular 
line, the second will be on the midclavicular line between the thoracic cage and iliac crest 
level of umbilicus, the third will be below umbilicus on the same line. The same sites will 
be evaluated on the contralateral side.  There wi ll be two more locations on midline. The 
first will be midway between umbilicus and xiphoid, and the second will be midway 
between umbilicus and midpoint of a line drawn between iliac crests.  
Cold tests will be performed by [CONTACT_355031] a clean nitrile glove, first 
applied to the patient’s forearm where they will be asked to describe how it feels to confirm 
ice cold. Then the same ice -filled glove will be applied to the same 8 points on the 
abdomen described above, asking the patient to confirm “yes” when they feel cold 
equivalent or greater to that on their forearm. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_354983] [ADDRESS_441983] area of 0.2  mm in diameter using a stimulato r (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_354984], MRC Systems, Heidelberg, [LOCATION_013]).  
The initial measurement will be in the preanesthesia care unit, prior to block

hourly intervals (x3) then at 12 hours postop (defined as patient leaving the OR), 18 hours 
postop, 24 hours postop, 30, 36 hours postop, 48 hours postop, 60 hours postop , 72 
hours postop (when patients are not sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). Testing will continue until abdominal wall 
sensation returns or [ADDRESS_441985] 
locations. If the TAP block did not initially cover all eight locations, sensation will be 
considered recovered when patients sense ice and pi[INVESTIGATOR_354985] ≥75% of the covered points 
(i.e., 5/7, 5/6, 4/5, 3/4, 3/3, etc.). Two sequential evaluatio ns will be needed to be negative 
and first negative time will be accepted as the return of sensation.  
Secondary outcome 2  
Pain Scores after surgery will be measured using a Verbal Response Scale (VRS). 
VRS is a scale from [ADDRESS_441986] of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354986].  Data obtained from electronic medical records 
will include: operation time, surgery type, intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], 
postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_354987], breakthrough pain medication 
requirements, pain scores in PACU and ward, req uirement of oxygen in PACU and ward, 
pruritus, requirement of antihistaminic medications, requirement of naloxone, itching, 
ambulatio n time, flatus, ileus, bowel movements (first time documented), constipation, 
length of stay and any side effects or complications.  
Tertiary  Outcome 4   
Pain Scores with movement after surgery will be measured using a Verbal 
Response Scale (VRS).  The VRS will be recorded every [ADDRESS_441987] prior to leg raise for reference.  
Tertiary Outcome 5.  
           Patient’s mobility will be obtained from VISI monitoring device for 72 
hours/discharge surgery  
 
F. Data Analysis  
Randomized groups will be compared for baseline balance using standard descriptive 
statistics and the standardized difference (difference in means or proportions divided by 
[CONTACT_103884]).

 23 Primary Outcomes .  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] .  The following tests for superiority on opi[INVESTIGATOR_354988] (see type I error control below):  1) [ADDRESS_441988] -
surgery: compare each of exparel and plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338303]; and 2) [ADDRESS_441989]-surgery: compare exparel to each  of plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338304].   Groups will be 
compared using linear regression on log -transformed morphine equivalents, with results 
reported as ratio of geometric means between each pair of interventions.   
Type I error control across Primary outcomes 1 and 2 . We will use a parallel 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_354989] I error at 5% across the 2 primary outcomes.  
The 2 comparisons for the 0 -24 hour period will constitute Set #1, and the 2 comparisons 
for the 24 -48 hour period will constitute Set #2. With in each set we will use the Holm -
Bonferroni (HB) multiple comparison procedure among the two comparisons.  If either 
test in the first Set is significant (HB: significance criterion of 0.025 for smaller P -value 
and 0.05 for the larger), analysis will continue to Set #2. Otherwise, Set #2 will not be 
analyzed.   If analysis proceeds to Set #2, the overall alpha for Set #2 will be 0.05 x 
proportion of significant tests in Set #1 (i.e., Set #2 alpha = either 0.05 x 1 or 0.05 x ,5 = 
0.025).  
Secondary Outcomes.    
Time to return of sensation .   We will compare the 3 randomized groups on the time to 
detection of return of sensation (see above; i.e., when patients feels both ice and pi[INVESTIGATOR_354990] [ADDRESS_441990] locations, or ≥75% of the covered points if the TAP 
block did not initially cover all eight locations) using a time -to event Kaplan -Meier analysis 
and log -rank test, and comparing patients on the estimated median time to return of 
sensation.  If all patients do have return of sensation (as exp ected), the analysis will be 
equivalent to a Wilcoxon rank sum test, and so this test and the corresponding Hodges -
Lehman estimator of median difference (CI) will be reported as a sensitivity analysis. The 
significance criterion for each of the 3 compariso ns will be 0.05/3 = 0.[ADDRESS_441991]

 24 correlation assuming an autoregressive correlation structure (or unstructured or other, 
whichever fits best; but making sure to also account for the differences in timing between 
the measurements) with fixed effects of treatment and categorical time.  Whil e we will 
assess the treatment -by-time interaction, main results will be reported collapsing over 
time regardless of a significant interaction.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 48 -72 hours .  This will be analyzed using linear regression as with 
the primary outcomes.  
Type I error will be controlled at 0.05 for secondary outcomes by [CONTACT_2329] a significance 
criterion of 0.05/3=0.[ADDRESS_441992] -effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the mean difference in costs divided by [CONTACT_355032] [or an an alogous 
ratio using summaries which best fit the distribution of the data].    
Total cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354991].  Data obtained from electronic medical records will 
include: operation time, surgery type, intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_354987], breakthrough pain medication requirements, 
pain scores in PACU and ward, req uirement of oxygen in PACU and ward, pruritus, 
requirement of antihistaminic medications, requirement of naloxone, itching, ambulation 
time, flatus, ileus, bowel movements (first time documented), constipation, length of stay 
and any side effects or compli cations.  
Comparison of  Exparel , Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354920] [ADDRESS_441993] interim analyses at 
each 25% of the planned enrollment to assess efficacy and futility of the intervention using 
a gamma spending function. Specifically, we will maintain the overall alpha level 
(monitoring efficacy) at 0.05 using gamma parameter of -4 [similar to O’Brien Fleming], 
and power at 90% (monitoring beta, type II error) using gamma parameter of 0 [more 
aggressive, similar to Pocock].  Under the alternative hypothesis (assuming a true 50% 
relative r eduction in the primary outcome) the cumulative probability of crossing an 
efficacy (and futility in parentheses) boundary at the 1st through 4th analyses will be 0.09 
(0.025), 0.39 (0.05), 0.75 (0.075) and 0.90 (0.10) as shown in Figure 1.

G. Sample Size Considerations  
 

Comparison of  Exparel , Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_354920] [ADDRESS_441995] 90% power at the overall 0.[ADDRESS_441996] a relative improvement of 40% or more in mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556](i.e., 
ratio of geometric means of 0.60) between any of the 3 interventions, assessing 
separatel y for 0 -24 hours (primary outcome #1) and 24 -48 hours (primary outcome #2) 
postoperatively.   Assuming a coefficient of variation (CV = SD/,mean) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_354992] 0.85 [since the outcome is expected to be log -normal], the required 
sample size to w ill be 67 per group or 201 total.  After adjusting for the interim analyses 
the maximum sample size will be 79 per group or a total of 237.  Alternatively, for example, 
a total (maximum) sample size of [ADDRESS_441997] 25% 
reduction in the mean.  
 
Internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_354993]. At the second interim analysis, we will 
conduct an internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_354994] (CV). If the CV is larger than planned in t he 
protocol, we will resize the study accordingly, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_354995]. For 
example, if the observed CV is 1.0 (instead of 0.85), the new maximum sample size would 
be a total of [ADDRESS_441998] the same 40% relative reduction in the out comes. The 
internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_354996] I error of the study nor alter the effect size 
of interest.  
 
Adaptive design option.  At the 3rd interim analysis we may consider an adaptive design 
in which the study is repowered for a smaller but still clinically important treatment effect.  
Specifically, if the conditional power at the 3rd look is between 30% an d 75%, the DSMB 
(or Executive Committee) we will consider resizing the study to have 90% power to detect 
a relative reduction as small as 20% (i.e., a ratio of geometric means of 0.80).  71

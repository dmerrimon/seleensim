devices is a CCD chip or “miniature camera” that is placed at the tip of the 
laryngoscope.  The image is transmitted to a screen for the anesthesiologist 
to observe.  These laryngoscopes have been termed video  laryngoscopes.   
Video  laryngoscopes reduce pressure on the soft tissue of the upper airway 
and provide a high -resolution, wide angle view of the upper airway and 
larynx.   Video  laryngos copes, consequently , decrease the risk of upper airway 
trauma and improve the ease of tracheal intubation.   The first video

 laryngoscope introduced into clinical practice was the Glides cope ( Verathon 
Medical, 2003).[ADDRESS_699622] laryngosc ope.  Video  laryngoscopy is also  
included in current guidelines for  difficult tracheal intubation.6   Other video  
laryngoscopes in clinical use throughout the world include the CMAC ( Kart 
Storz  Imaging ), Tru -View  (Truphatek ), McGrath  (Covidien) , Pentax AWS  
(Pentax) , and the King Vision  (Ambu) .  Some of these devices have pediatric 
sized blades and some do not.  
     Processing,  portability, and cost are important aspects  of video  
laryngoscope selection.  Some devices have patient contact [CONTACT_537201], while other devices are reusable and require processing for 
sterilization or high -grade disinfection.   Patient cross -contamination with 
potentially infectious material is an increasing concer n with reusable airway 
devices.[ADDRESS_699623] is always a c oncern.  Some video  laryngoscopes require a 
separate stand and monitor, and reusable blades.   The initial capi[INVESTIGATOR_537200] $35,000.   The initial financial 
outlay for the King Vision is $1500.  
     The King Vision v ideo  laryngoscope was introduced  into clinical practice 
in 2011.  The King Vision video laryngoscope is an FDA Device Class CCW 
instrument that is 510(K) exempt: regulation number 868.5540.  This device

 consists of a reusable, imaging  wand that is inserted into a disposable blade 
(size 3).  Published reports have documented the value of the King Vision 
video  laryngoscope  in older children and adults. 8,[ADDRESS_699624] ($11 per intubation) and extreme portability.

3.0 Inclusion/Exclusion C riteria  
Inclusion:  
1. All children between the ages of [ADDRESS_699626] examination  
2. Scheduled for a surgical procedure that requires tracheal intubation shall 
be included.    
 
 
Confidential  Rev3.28.16   6 
 Exclusion : 
1. Patients that will be excluded are  those with an airway examination or 
previous anesthesia history that suggests difficulty with mask ventilation.  
4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
[ADDRESS_699627].  
2. After the induction of anesthesia , and when the patient is at an adequa te 
depth of anesthesia , tracheal in tubation will be performed  with the King 
Vision video laryngoscope  by [CONTACT_54858].   
3. Data recorded will include gender, age, and weight of the patient.   
4. Data specific to the device and tracheal intubation include; size and type 
of blade (stand ard vs. channeled), blade tip position, Cormack -Lehane 
score, tracheal tube size, and a subjective scoring of tracheal tube 
delivery.

 6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems   
Involving Risk to Participants or Others  
We do not anticipate adverse events related to this study.  This is a data 
collections only study therefore there are minimal to no risks to the subjects.  
There is a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality. PHI will be accessed for  
recruitment purposes by [CONTACT_537202]/or research care team.  
All data shared with the sponsor will be  unidentifiable.  
Any reports of adverse events can be made to:  
Nicole Horn , M.D. @ Office number: 317 -944 -9835 or Pager: 317 -312 -2570 
7.0 Stati stical Considerations  
As this is not a comparative study, only descriptive statistics will be applied.  
8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issue  
Data will be kept secure in a password protected database and all paper 
documentation will be kept in a secure office  of th e Anesthesia department.  
10.[ADDRESS_699628] Retention  
There will not be a follow up period for this study.  Records will be kept until 
all data analysis is complete and the study has been completed.

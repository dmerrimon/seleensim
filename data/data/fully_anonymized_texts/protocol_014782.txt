INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: 
 
Several studies have evaluated operator and (patient) exposure comparing left and right 
transradial approaches. The TALENT study by [CONTACT_159682] 
a
dsorbed by [CONTACT_159683], particularly in older patients and for operators in 
training. This study laid the foundation examining different radiation doses comparing left and 
right transradial approaches. Subsequent studies (OPERA, RAD-MATRIX) examined operator 
dose favoring LRA procedures. However the primary access point for interventional cardiologist 
is the RRA due to catheterizations laboratories historically set up for the operator to work from 
the right side of the fluoroscopic table which makes it a more ergonomic procedure. In light of 
new data elucidating that an adducted right arm yields lower amounts of operator exposure 
compared with an abducted arm we seek to determine if this technique will yield similar operator 
radiation exposure comparing an adducted right radial artery approach to a left radial artery 
approach. 
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
• S tudying the difference between radiation exposure to primary operator for diagnostic 
coronary angiography procedure with right transradial access in HARRA position versus 
standard left transradial access.  
• Eva luating the radiation exposure difference between right and left eye of the primary 
operator  
• Studying the total fluoroscopic time and patient’s radiation exposure during the 
diagnostic coronary angiogram and its relationship to presence of subclavian artery 
tortuosity 
 
HYPOTHESIS 
 
Several studies have shown that operator exposure via left transradial catheterization has yielded 
less operator exposure compared to standard right transradial procedure. However, in light of 
new data, we hypothesize a hyperadducted right arm during right transradial cardia c 
catheterization will yield comparable, or the same operator radiation exposure. 
 
STUDY DESIGN 
 
Randomized, non-blinded prospective study 
 
Subjects:  Explain who potential subjects are, where they will be recruited, etc.: 
• All the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) physician operators who consent 
to participate in the study are the primary study subjects 
• 7-10 CCL physician operators will participate in the study as the primary study 
subjects 
• P atients undergoing the procedure will be secondary study subjects only 
• Sample size for secondary study subjects: 534 patients of any sex and gender and 
Age> 18 years old 
• Patients seen at Maimonides Medical Center, who meet the inclusion criteria 
 
Eligibility Criteria: Include inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
• All the Cardiac catheterization laboratory physician operators who consent to participate 
in the study 
• P atients of any sex and gender. 
• Age  > 18 years old. 
• P atients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiogram from in-patient and out-patient 
settings 
Exclusion Criteria: 
• Hist ory of prior CABG (Coronary Artery By[CONTACT_42594]). CABG patients will be 
excluded due to inherent increased fluoroscopic time (finding grafts). 
• P atients undergoing elective PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) 
• P atients that have cognitive dysfunction 
 
Data Collection Procedures:   
 
Variables to be collected include: 
Operator variables 
• Primary operator’s radiation exposure at the end of a case at four sites: right and left eye, 
thorax and abdomen 
• P rimary operator’s normalized radiation dose exposure, measured by [CONTACT_159684] (CD/DAP) 
• P rimary operator’s height, weight and body surface area 
Patient variables 
• medical record number 
• dose area product (cGy.cm2) [radiation to patient] 
• fluoroscopy time (minutes)  
• a mount of contrast delivered in cc’s 
• Milligray [radiation to patient] 
• number of cineangiograms taken 
• number of diagnostic catheters used for the exam 
• age  
• se x (female, male) 
• race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, East Asian (Chinese etc.), South Asian (India, 
Pakistan & surrounding areas), other 
• he ight measured in centimeters 
• weight measured in kilograms 
• body mass index 
• body surface area 
• h ypertension  
• diabe tes  
• smok er   
• pre vious coronary angiography  
• c hronic kidney disease  
• dist al radial approach used  
• P resence of subclavian artery tortuosity 
 
Statistical analysis: 
 
Sample size: 
• Num ber of CCL physician operators as the primary study subjects: 10 
• Estimated number of participants to be screened as secondary study subjects: 1500 
• Elig ible participants to be included as the secondary study subjects in the study: 534 
• C alculation for power analysis: Sample size was calculated using data from a previous 
study (Dominici et al., 2013).  Left radial artery values were M=33, SD=37 μSv and right 
ra
dial artery values were M=44, SD=[ADDRESS_185472] due to skewed data with alpha=0.05, power=0.90, a balanced study design, 
with a two tailed test, and adding 10% to each group for sample size for people who start 
the procedure but due to difficulty in catheter placement then cannot continue the 
procedure and need to use a different access site.  This results in 267 participants for each 
of the left radial artery and right radial artery groups for a total of 534 participants.  
 
Dat
a Analysis:    
 
• B iostatistician will be analyzing de-identified data and will guide  statistical 
interpretation 
• De scriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation will be used for the continuous 
variables. Frequency and percentage will be used for the categorical variables. Inferential 
statis
tics of the Mann Whitney test will be used to compare μSv values in operators 
be
tween the left radial artery and right radial artery groups.   
 
Expected Outcomes: Explain what you hope the study will determine. 
 
We expect to find that using hyperadduction technique of the right arm can make 
operators radiation exposure from the hyperadducted right radial approach is less.  The 
objec
tive of this study is superiority with a power value of 80%.

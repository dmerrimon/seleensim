1.What is the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study is to find out  if eating oatmeal, a common breakfast food, will increase the blood levels of a
lipid that has shown to have protective effects against obesity and inflammation.
Ten ( 10) people will be enrolled in  this study at Vanderbilt.
2.What will happen and how long will you be in the study?
Screening Day
If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to come to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC) for a
screening visit. We will do a physical exam and ask  you about  your medical history.
If you are eligible for the study, we will schedule a day to come back to the CRC.  
Study Day  
You will come to the CRC in the morning. It is important that you have nothing to eat or drink after  10pm before you 
come. 
We will insert a small tube in the vein in  one of your arms. We will take a blood sample (about 5ml or 1 teaspoon) from 
the tube.  We will then give a bowl of oatmeal to eat. We will take blood samples (about 1 teaspoon  each) at  
30, 60, [ADDRESS_102735] value and may be developed and owned  
by [CONTACT_5984], Vanderbilt University, and/or others. If this happens, there are no plans to provide money to you. 
May we contact [CONTACT_92948]?

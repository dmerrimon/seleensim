Amendment 3
Rationale for amendment
The purpose of Amendment 3 is to remove the interim analy sisthat was to occur after 300 
subjects completed the study . Due to the speed of enrollment into the study , an interim 
analysis is no longer as feasible or as informative since this analy sis would be performed after 
all of the patients had alread y been enrolled, and only  3 to 4 months prior to study  completion.
All relevant s ection(s) of the protocol are updated to reflect the removal of the interim 
analysis.
Additionally , other administrative changes include the following:
Under List of Abbreviations added “EOS” End of Study .
Section 6; Table 6- 1 Assessment Schedule added (EOS) under visit number 10 to align 
with section 5.5.2.

Protocol number LCZ696BUS13
Title A 52 week, open label evaluation of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan 
(LCZ696) therapy on biomarkers, m yocardial remodeling and patient -
reported outcomes in heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection 
fraction (PROVE -HF). 
Brief title Effects of sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure subjects treated as 
per standard of care.
Sponsor and Clinical 
Phase[COMPANY_001] 
Clinical Phase IV
Investigation type Drug
Study type Interventional, Open -label
Purpose and 
rationaleThe purpose of this study is to determine early and more chronic changes 
in concentrations of biomarkers related to mechanisms of action (MOA) 
and effects of sacubitril/valsartan th erapy over a period of 12 months, and 
correlate these biomarker changes with cardiac remodeling parameters, 
patient -reported outcomes and cardiovascular outcomes.
This protocol will allow for evaluation of improved understanding of the 
interplay between sacubitril/valsartan and biomarkers, remodeling and 
outcomes, and will carefully assess such relationships within important 
cohorts of subjects, such as those with low NT -proBNP/BNP at baseline, 
those naïve to HF therapy, as well as those that are unable to achieve 
target dose of sacubitril/valsartan.
This protocol will also generate a biorepository of well- handled and 
carefully considered biomarkers, which will allow a better understanding of 
sacubitril/valsartan MOA
Primary Objective(s) The primary  objective of this study is to examine the association between 
change in concentration of NT -proBNP and change in structural cardiac 
measurements (LV end s ystolic and diastolic volume indices, LVEF, and 
LA volume index) from baseline to one year.
Secondar y 
ObjectivesExamine the association between change in concentration of  NT -proBNP 
and change in structural cardiac measurements (LV end systolic and 
diastolic volume indices, LVEF, and LA volume index) from baseline to [ADDRESS_338496], these subgroups are:
1.Subjects with HFrEF and “low” NT -proBNP (<600 if not 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277292] <400 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or “low” BNP (<150 if not 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], <100 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) at baseline ( Ambrosy, 2012 ).

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 13

2.Subjects with new onset HF and/or RAAS naïve ( Fonarow, 2010 ). 
3.Subjects who are not receiving the target sacubitril/valsartan dose 
(McMurray, 2014 ). 
Examine the association b etween the change in NT -proBNP concentrations 
and patient- reported outcomes from the KCCQ -[ADDRESS_338497] of outpatient male and female subjects, ≥ 
18 years of age, with HFrEF ≤40%.   The goal is to have a total of 
approximately [ADDRESS_338498] as a candidate for treatment 
with sacubitril/valsartan as per USPI [INVESTIGATOR_277293].
Key Inclusion 
criteriaSubjects eligible for inclusion in this study have to fulfill all of the fol lowing 
criteria:

4.NYHA Functional class II-IV.
5.LVEF ≤40% via any local measurement within the past 6 months using 
echocardiography, multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA), CT scanning, 
MRI or ventricular angiography provided no subsequent study 
documenting an EF of >40%. If the EF measurement is e xpressed as 
a value range, the average of the range endpoint values should be 
used as the EF.
6.If a subject is on a loop diuretic, they must be on a s table dose for 2 
weeks prior to baseline .

baseline to one year   
Secondary:
Change in concentration of NT -proBNP from baseline to 6 months
Change in LVESVi, LVEDVi, LVEF, and LA volume index (LAVi) from 
baseline to 6 months
Change in KCCQ -23 baseline to one year
Key safety

Adverse event monitoring 
Other assessments An assessment of subject reported outcomes is planned in this trial 
using Quality of life, based on the Clinical Score of the KCCQ -23.
Data analysisPearson’s correlation coefficient and its two -sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) to examine the association between change in log -transformed 
NT-proBNP and LVESVi, LVEDVi, LVEF, and LAVi from baseline to 
one year and baseline to 6 months will be calculated 
Similar correlation coefficients and CIs will be calculated for the 
following subgroups:  
Subjects with de novo HF (naïve to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy ) and 
those with previously established HF.
Subjects with NT -proBNP values <600 pg/mL (or 400 pg/mL if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277296] 1 year) at the time of drug initiation, and 
those with higher values.
In those not receiving the target sacubitril/valsartan dose and those
achieving target dose.
In those with an NT -proBNP concentration <1000 pg/mL at Month 12 
and those with NT -proBNP ≥1000 pg/mL at the same time point.
As a function of time from baseline to an NT -proBNP value of <1000 
pg/mL for subjects with a baseline value >=1000 pg/mL (percentiles of 
response time).
As a function of time spent with NT -proBNP concentration <1000 
pg/mL across study visits (percentiles of response time).
The primary  analysis of the primary  efficacy variables will be based on 
the Full Analysis Set.
An analysis of variance will be done to compare the mean change in 
the KCCQ -23 clinical summary  score between the groups of subjects 
with NT -proBNP<1000 pg/mL and NT -proBNP>=1000 pg/mL at Month 
12.Propensity score adjustments will be used in the comparison of 
treatment groups.
We would like to estimate the correlation coefficient between change in 
log NT -proBNP and each structural cardiac measurement overall and 
in each subgroup of interest with a precision (half -width of the 
confidence interval (CI)) of at least 0.15 for a 2 -sided 95% CI. The 
subgroups of interest are:  (1) subjects with HFrEF and “low” NT -
proBNP (<600 if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277292] <400 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or “low” BNP 
(<150 if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277297], <100 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) at baseline, (2) subjects 
with new onset HF and/or RAAS naïve, and (3) subjects who are not 
receiving the target sacubitril/valsartan dose. It is estimated that these 
subgroups will represent approximately 25%, 20% and 30% of the
study population, respectively.  Assuming, the population correlation 
coefficient of -0.[ADDRESS_338501] 0.15 for the estimated correlation coeffici ent would be n=133.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Globally , heart failure (HF) is reaching epi[INVESTIGATOR_277298], leading to substantial efforts to 
understand the biology  of HF, improve 
recognition of its presence, and more optimally  
manage subjects so-affected.  As such strides 
have been made in the study  of risk factors for 
progressive HF, as well as the means by [CONTACT_277318].
A fundamental goal in the management of 
subjects with HF and reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) is the prevention of myocardial 
remodeling.  As noted by [CONTACT_277319], 2011, 
myocardial remodeling is central in the pathophy siology  of advancing HF; 
for example, 
subjects with cardiovascular (CV) events in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement study  
(Konstam 2011) of HFrEF demonstrated considerabl y greater degrees of myocardial 
remodeling compared to those without events (Figure 1).
The benefit of contemporary  HF 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_277299] -remodeling 
benefits of such agents, including 
agents blocking the renin 
angiotensin aldosterone system 
(Figure 2).  Unfortunately , however, 
risk for remodeling of the 
myocardium may be challenging to 
recognize.
Biomarkers are increasingl y 
measured as a tool to diagnose, 
establish prognosis, as well as to 
monitor or guide HF therapy .  The 
gold standa rd HF biomarkers are B-
type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its amino- terminal pro-fragment equivalent (NT-proBNP).  
Concentrations of BNP and NT-proBNP not only provide unique diagnostic information for 
HF, but also allow for an understanding of the underl ying biology  of HF, including 
identify ing the presence and severity  of myocardial remodeling.  As articulated by [CONTACT_277320] 
2013, both peptides have Class I, level of evidence.  A  support in current clinical practice 
guidelines for diagnosis and prognosis in HF ( Yancy  2013 ) and in 2014, more than 20 million 
measurements of these two peptides were made.  

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 19
Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. C LCZ696BUS13
With well-established links between change in the natriuretic peptides during HF therapy  and 
both myocardial remodeling as well as outcomes, increasingly , clinicians 
turn to biomarkers 
such as BNP or NT-proBNP for decision making regarding prognosis and therap y changes in 
subjects so affected ( Ambrosy  2012; Januzzi 2011 ; Masson 2006).  
It is now widel y accepted that among subjects with HFrEF an NT-proBNP concentration 
<1000 pg/mL  during therapy  titration is associated with significantl y less likelihood for 
deleterious LV remodeling than subjects with concentrations above this value (table 1) 
(Konstam 2011), and lower NT-proBNP concentrations are also associated with better 
outcome as well, (Januzzi 2011; Masson 2006 ).  Furthermore, as opposed to a single 
measurement, across serial measurement, the time spent with an NT-proBNP <1000 pg/m L 
over a one year period was reported to be even more strongl y associated not only with 
superior outcome (Gaggin 2013 ), but also with more robust improvement in LV and left atrial 
(LA) size and function ( Weiner 2013 ).
Remodeling metrics include LVEF as 
well as measures of both systolic and 
diastolic volumes, LV end systolic 
volume index (LVESVi) and LV end 
diastolic volume index (LVEDVi).  
Change in each has been used as th e gold 
standard for LV reverse remodeling.
Beyond the clinical value of BNP or NT -
proBNP, measurement of circulating HF 
biomarkers may also be helpful to 
understand mechanism of benefit of HF 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_277300] (MOA) of such 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Preliminary  studies
In the landmark Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI  to Determine Impact on Global 
Mortality  in HF [PARADIGM -HF](McMurray  2014) study , changes in both BNP and NT-
proBNP were seen during the sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) run-in period, at 4 weeks, and 8 
months (Packer 2015): treatment with sacubitril/valsartan led to substantial reduction in NT-
proBNP, thought to be refle ctive of benefit of the drug.  Bey ond this, it is y et unclear whether 
NT-proBNP reduction predicted other favorable 
effects in therapy  of HFrEF such as reverse 
LV remodeling.  Through inhibition of neprily sin by [CONTACT_277321], 
sacubitril/valsartan led to a rise in BNP concentration. The ramification of such increase in 
BNP concentration relative to diagnostic and prognostic accuracy  remains unclear; for 
example, it is unknown if measurement of BNP will retain association/correlation with LV 
remodeling and/or prognosis.  This may have substantial ramification regarding the future of 
BNP, the most widely  measured natriuretic peptide in the [LOCATION_002].  
Limitations of the PARADIGM- HF biomarker experience include onl y limited time points for 
blood sampling, which hampers ability  to examine short and longer term changes in 
biomarkers following initiation and up titration of sacubitril/valsartan.  As well, only  one BNP 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 20
Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. C LCZ696BUS13
assay  was assessed in PARADIGM -HF. It is thus uncertain whether other commerci ally 
available BNP assay s utilizing different antibody  pairs will demonstrate the same effect from 
neprily sin inhibition. As BNP is widel y used for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation, 
understanding effects of sacubitril/valsartan on representative BNP assays is of substantial 
importance.  Furthermore, it remains unclear whether effects of sacubitril/valsartan differ on 
biomarker profiles of subjects naïve to HF therapy  (“new starts”) or in those with NT-
proBNP/BNP concentrations below those used for inclusion in PARADIGM- HF.  Crucially , 
no data exist regarding effects of sacubitril/valsartan on LV remodeling.  Lastly, because of 
challenges in handling of blood samples, several candidate markers of sacubitril/valsartan 
MOA could not be measured in the PARAD IGM -HF trial or biorepository .
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this study  is to determine early and more chronic changes in concentrations of 
biomarkers related to mechanisms of action (MOA) and effects of sacubitril/valsartan therapy 
over a period of 12 months, and correlate these biomarker changes with cardiac remodeling 
parameters, patient- reported outcomes and cardiovascular outcomes.
2 Study  objectives and endpoints
2.1 Primary  objective(s)
The primary  objective of this study  is to examine the association between change in 
concentration of NT-proBNP and change in structural cardiac measurements (LV end systolic 
and diastolic volume indices, LVEF, and LA volume index) from baseline to one y ear. 
2.2 Secondary  objective(s)
Examine the association between change in concentr ation of  NT -proBNP and change in 
structural cardiac measurements (LV end s ystolic and diastolic volume indices, LVEF, 
and LA volume index) from baseline to [ADDRESS_338503], these 
subgroups are:
1.Subjects with HFrEF and “low” NT -proBNP (<600 if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277292] <400 if

3 Investigational plan
3.1 Stud y design
This study  uses an open -label, single -arm design. The study  duration is a maximum of 52 
weeks (365 days). A study  cohort of approximately  830 subjects will be enrolled.  Subjects 
will be considered eligible if they are identified as clinically  appropriate HFrEF subjects and
who are candidates for on-label sacubitril/valsartan treatment per the USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_277301].
Screening epoch
Subjects will be screen edto assess eligibility  requirements and to confirm that subjects meet 
all study  entry criteria.  At screening, safet y blood and urine samples will be collected and 
submitted to the central laboratory .  
Baseline (Day 1) 
Sacubitril/valsartan will be dispensed to eligible subjects at Visit 2 (Day 1/baseline). Initial 
dosing and titration will be done according the [LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information (USPI )
.
Subjects that have been treated with ACEi befor e the study  will require a 36-hour wash out 
period before starting 
sacubitril/valsartan treatment.  These subjects will be instructed to wait 
[ADDRESS_338504] dose of sacubitril/valsartan. 
Their first dose of sacubitril/valsartan will therefore be approximately  [ADDRESS_338505] dose 
of ACEi .
Open Label treatment epoch
The open label treatment period duration is 12 months. Visits will occur every  2
 weeks until 
Visit 6 (Day  60) and then at 7, 8, 9 and 10 (end o f study ). 
Titration of study  treatment initiated at Visit 2 (baseline) will be done according to the USPI. 
Deviation from the titration schedule or dose adjustments will only  be allowed if indicated per 
protocol defined safety and tolerability  criteria section 5.4.5 and investigator judgment, if the 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 22
Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. C LCZ696BUS13
investigator believes that adjustment/elimination of concomitant medications is not possible 
or does not alleviate the side effects of concern. Protocol required assessments for each visit 
will be done according to the schedule of assessments ( Table 6-1).
Figure 3-1 Study  design 
3.2 Rationale for study  design
Open questions about sacubitril/valsartan exist; this protocol will address some of the 
important gaps in knowledge regarding this novel drug.  Measurement of biomarkers BNP 
and NT-proBNP are now routine assessments in standard care for HF subjects.  The use of 
these biomarker has a Class I, level of evidence A for prognosis in clinical practice guidelines 
(Yancy  2013).  Biomarkers (including NT-proBNP) are well- associated and correlated with 
myocardial remodeling as well ( Wein er 2013 ).
It is understood that sacubitril/valsartan has substantial effects on NT-proBNP and BNP, but 
these effects are fundamentally  different.  There is a critical need to provide greater clarity  for 
clinicians on how to interpret information on both biomarkers during treatment with 
sacubitril/valsartan, given the increasing frequency  of therapy  monitoring with natriuretic 
peptides.  For BNP, mis
-interpretation of a “rise” in the values could theoretically  lead to mis -
treatment of subjects. This could also result in clinician confusion regarding 
sacubitril/valsartan (ie. -it could be thought of as “toxic” and leading to rise in BNP).  
Another possibility  is frustration with either BNP or sacubitril/valsartan, creating risk that 
they may cease measuring the biomarker or using the drug).  It is unclear if BNP will impart 
useful information regarding remodeling and prognosis when subjects are treated with Open label treatment Epoch Screening

sacubitril/valsartan. It is also unclear what effect sacubitril/valsartan has on BNP using 
different BN P assay s in broad clinical use.  
While sacubitril/valsartan treatment was shown in the PARADI GM-HF trial to have an early 
and sustained benefit in mortality  reduction and HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277302] -directed medical therapy , clinical data are 
lacking regarding whether sacubitril/valsartan therap y fosters significant LV or LA 
remodeling (McMurray 2014).  As reported by [CONTACT_277319] 2011 degree of myocardial 
remodeling following HF therapy  strongl y predicts benefit of such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Konstam 2011).  
Examining the inter-relationship between biomarkers, echocardiographic remodeling, and 
clinical (and subject -reported) outcomes would provide substantial understanding regarding 
mechanism of benefit from sacubitril/valsartan therap y.
In view of this significant treatment benefit demonstrated in the PARADIGM -HF trial, 
[COMPANY_001] has provided guidance for compan y
-supported trials that the randomized period for 
assessing sacubitril/valsartan against an active comparator may not exceed 12 weeks.  The 
intermediate -term and chronic biomarker changes, as well as the structural heart reverse 
remodeling endpoints being evaluated in this trial require a study  period of 12 months.  
Because this exceeds the 12 week guidance, it precludes a two arm study  design with an 
active comparator, and trial needs dictate a single arm design.  
This protocol will allow for evaluation of improved understanding of the interplay  between 
sacubitril/valsartan and biomarkers, remodeling and outcomes, and will carefull y assess such 
relationships within important cohorts of subjects, such as those with low NT -proBNP/BNP at 
basel ine, those naïve to HF therapy , as well as those that are unable to achieve target dose of 
sacubitril/valsartan.
This protocol will also generate a biorepository of well-handled and carefull y considered 
biomarkers, which will allow a better understanding o f sacubitril/valsartan MOA.

3.5 Risks and benefits
The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by [CONTACT_5345], and close clinical monitoring.
Experience in the PARADIGM -HF trial, both in the run-in period as well as the double -blind 
randomization period, indicated that the major risks associated with the treatment of 
sacubitril /valsartan are renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. Results from the 
TITRATION study  indicated that subjects who are ACE or ARB naïve are at an increased risk 
of experiencing these adverse events.
In this study , the risk of experiencing renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension are 
mitigated by [CONTACT_277322]- titration of the drug every  two weeks according to the USPI .  The 
risks are further mitigated by [CONTACT_277323].  Subjects entering 
into the study  will have their BP evaluated and be treated with 
sacubitril/valsartan in 
accordance with the USPI.  
Sacubitril/ valsartan may also cause angioedema. The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_277303]/ valsartan.  To decrease this risk, all 
subjects commencing the open -label treatment period will undergo a 36 hour wash out period 
prior to starting sacubitril/valsartan to minimize the interaction between an ACEi and 
sacubitril/valsartan in potentiating the development of angioedema.
All subjects will be allowed to continue receiving the rest of their background cardiovascular 
(CV) medications throughout the study . Subjects will be enrolled only after the investigator 
has confirme d the subject is on stable treatment with guideline -directed therap y for HFrEF, 
other than ACEis and ARBs, which will ensure that subjects are receiving appropriate 
treatment for their heart failure.
In the PARADIGM -HF study , sacubitril/ valsartan reduced the risk of CV death and HF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277304], sacubitril/ valsartan is now indicated to 
reduce these risks in subjects with chronic heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and reduced 
ejection fraction.
[ADDRESS_338506] of outpatient male and female subjects, ≥ 18 years of age, 
with HFrEF ≤ 40%.  The goal is to have a total of approximately  830 subjects enrolled, in 
approximately  100 centers in the [LOCATION_002].  At the time of enrol lment, subjects will be 
considered eligible if they are identified as clinically  appropriate HFrEF subjects and eligible 
to receive sacubitril/valsartan per the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_277291]., as well as meeting all 
other inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

should consider whether dose adjustments of concomitant medications may rectify  the 
situation before reducing the dose of study  treatment. If adjustment of the concomitant 
medications is not possible or does not alleviate the side effects of concern, the investigator 
may down-titrate the dose of the study  drug, interrupt study  drug temporarily  or permanently 
discontinue study  drug at his/her discretion. Subjects may restart study  drug at any dose level 
following an interruption of treatment, based on investigator judgment.  If study  drug is

complete an end of study visit. 
Study  drug dose level adjustments should be mainly  based on overall safety  and tolerability 
with special focus on hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension and clinically  significant 
decrease in eGFR/increase in serum creatinine 
(defined as a serum creatinine of ≥0.5mg/dl

discretion of the investigator.
Medications and substances known to raise potassium levels
Potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, aldosterone antagonists, and any other 
medications known to raise 
potassium levels should be used with caution while the subject is 
receiving study  medication due to the increased possibility  of occurrence of hyperkalemia
(please refer to Appendix 2). Salt substitutes containing potassium chloride are also to be 
avoided when possible.  Potassium levels should be monitored regularl y especiall y in those

Study  medication may be discontinued at the investigator’s discretion if any of the following 
occur:
Any severe suspected drug related AE
Suspected occurrence of angioedema. A subject with any  signs or s ymptoms of clinically  
significant angioe dema should be thoroughl y evaluated b y the investigator to determine if 
it constitutes a reason for discontinuation of study  medication.
Depending on the serum potassium, blood pressure, or eGFR, subjects may need to have 
their study  drug dose or the dose of another concomitant medication reduced or 
discontinued; or, if appropriate, have potentially  contributing agents adjusted.   Refer to 
appendices for treatment guidelines for hy perkalemia, hy potension or renal dy sfunction, 
respectivel y.
If discontinuatio n of study  treatment occurs, the subject should return to the clinic as soon as 
possible, after discontinuation of study  drug, for an end of study  visit.  All assessments from 
the final visit (Visit 10) in the visit schedule of assessments (Table 6-1) must be completed 
and recorded in the eCRF.  The study  completion eCRF will also need to be completed. The 
investigator must determine the primary  reason for the

implicated as the putative mediator. Therefore, medications that raise the levels of 
endogenous brad ykinin by  [CONTACT_277332], such as ACE, 
aminopeptidase P, and NEP, may  result in this potentially  dangerous side effect. All suspected 
cases of angioedema, regardless of suspected causality , must be reported. The angioedema 
eCRF must be completed and the [COMPANY_001] Medical Monitor must be notified. 
If the angioedema event meets SAE criteria, the investigator must ensure that an SAE form is

7 Safety  monitoring
7.1 Adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study  until the end of study  visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally  or causall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.
In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an 
adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred.
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the subject 
at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may  be detected when they  are volunteered
by [CONTACT_109049], laboratory 
test findings, or other assessments.
Abnormal laboratory  values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria:
they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms, 
they are considered clinically
 significant, 
they require therapy . 
Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically  notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_131535]. Investigators have the responsibility  for managing the safet y of individual 
subject and identify ing adverse events. Alert ranges for laboratory  and other test abnormalities 
are included in Appendix [ADDRESS_338542] be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or 
diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by  [CONTACT_6644]:
mild: usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities
moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities
severe: prevents normal activities
All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the 
following: 
no action taken (e.g. further observation only ) 
[investigational] treatment dosage increased/ reduced
[investigational] treatment interrupted/withdrawn
concomitant medication or non- drug therap y given 
non-drug therap y given 
subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]/ subject ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18533] (see Section 7.2for definition of 
SAE)

Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CLCZ696BUS13
its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown)
Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged 
to be permanent, and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently , if necessary ) 
of any changes in severity , the suspected relationship to the study  drug, the interventions 
required to treat it, and the outcome.
Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the subject
informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study  as needed. Any 
new inform ation regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified 
between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator 
Notification or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New information might require an update to the 
informed consent and has then to be discussed with the subject .
The investigator must also instruct each subject to report any new adverse event (beyond the 
protocol observation period) that the subject , or the subject ’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonabl y be related to study  treatment. This information must be recorded in the 
investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001].
7.2 Serious adverse events 
7.2.1 Definition of SA E 
An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the 
following criteria:
is fatal or life -threatening 
results in persistent or significant disab ility/incapacity
constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect
requires in
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:
routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any
deterioration in condition (specify  what this includes)
elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study  and has not worsened since signing the informed 
consent
treatment on an emergency  outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling an y of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_37207] ’s 
general condition
is medically  significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may  
require medical or surgical intervention.

Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CLCZ696BUS13
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically  significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically  might have 
caused death if it were more severe (please refer to Annex I V,ICH-E2D Guideline).
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50068]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50069] (please refer to Annex I V, ICH-E2D Guideline).
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.

provided informed consent and until 30 days [after the last study  visit/ following the last 
administration of study  treatment if there are post-treatment follow -up visits with no required 
procedures] must be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any 
SAEs experienced after the 30 day period [after the last study  visit/ following the last 
administration of study  treatment if there are post-treatment follow -up visits with no required 
procedures] should only be reported to [COMPANY_001] if the investigator suspects a causal 
relationship to study  treatment.

the initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537] -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_30755] [ADDRESS_338544] be reported separatel y as a new event.
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete 
the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the complete d form within [ADDRESS_338545] continued or withdrew from study  participation.

(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/[ADDRESS_338546] to be considered 
during the course of the study :
Serum event:
confirmed (after ≥24h) increase in serum creatinine of ≥25% compared to baseline 
during normal hy dration status
Urine event
new onset ( ≥1+) proteinuria; confirmed by  [CONTACT_188657] -creatinine

new onset ( ≥1+), hematuria or gl ycosuria 
Every  renal laboratory  trigger or renal event as defined in Table 14 -1in Appendix 2 should be 
followed up by [CONTACT_277336] 2 . 
7.4 Reporting of study  treatment errors including misuse/abuse
Medication errors are uninten tional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, 
administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or 
consumer (EMA definition).
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally  and inappropriatel y 
used not in accordance with the protocol.
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal 
product, which is accompanied by  [CONTACT_50104].
Study  treatment errors and use s outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in 
the DAR (dose administration record) eCRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an 
AE/SAE and reported to 
Safety  only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be 
collected and reported in the safety  database irrespective of it being associated with an 
AE/SAE.

8 Data revie w and database management
8.1 Site monitoring
Before study  initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] 
representative will review the protocol and (e)CRFs with the investigators and their staff. 
During the study , [COMPANY_001] employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP 
compliance and the quality /integrity  of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to 
check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy  of entries on the (e)CRFs, the 
adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to 
ensure that study  treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these 
visits.  Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized 
monitor. Additionally , a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify  risks & 
trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to [COMPANY_001] Clinical Teams to assist 
with trial oversight.
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 50
Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CLCZ696BUS13
subject's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
[CONTACT_423] (a signed copy  is given to the subject).
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency  with the (e)CRF entries. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary  variables. Additional 
checks of the consistency  of the source data with the (e)CRFs are performed accordin g to the 
study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity  of the 
subjects will be disclosed.
8.2 Data collection
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_37290] (eCRFs) using fully  validated software that conforms to US CFR 21Part 
[ADDRESS_338548] the data. 
8.4 Data Monitoring Committee
Not applicable.
8.5 Angioedema A djudication Committee
8.5.1 Composition and Purpose
The Angioedema Adjudication Committee (AAC) consists of a group of experts in clinical 
angioedema who have been selected according to their educational, clinical, and research 
experience and are independent from [COMPANY_001]. The purpose of the AAC is to review and to 
adjudicate all suspected angioedema events in a uniform and consistent manner and to assign 
severit y for each confirmed case for the project wide sacubitril/ valsartan program. The AAC 
will remain blinded to treatment allocation during the adjudication process whenever possible 
and necessary .
8.5.2 Overview  of Site Responsibility
An overview of site responsibility  for reporting angioedema is described below.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 51
Amendm ent Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CLCZ696BUS13
At each study  visit, it is important for the investigator to pay special attention to any swelling 
or edema that may resemble angioedema or angioedema -like events that may be reported by 
[CONTACT_1766]. There will be a separate eCRF for angio edema events. If such an event occurs, the 
investigator will complete an Adjudication Questionnaire for an Angioedema -like Event form 
(provided by [CONTACT_5343]) to summarize the event, its treatment, and its ultimate outcome and 
communicate this report to Nova rtis as soon as possible. Follow -up reports must be 
communicated to [COMPANY_001] as soon as new information regarding the event becomes available. 
All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146495].
Occasionall y, the investigator may becontact[CONTACT_277337], or designee, regarding AEs that 
were reported on behalf of subjects that may resemble an angioedema -like event. The 
investigator or his/her delegated staff must complete the required report forms and supply  the 
required medical records for such events, regardless of whether the investigator views the 
event in question as angioedema or not.
All angioedema reports will be forwarded to an angioedema adjudication committee by 
[CONTACT_277338].
Submission of an angioede ma report is not a substitution for the submission of a SAE report. 
If an angioedema -like event satisfies the definition of a SAE, the investigator must submit a 
SAE report in addition to the Adjudication Questionnaire for an Angioedema -like Event.
Please refer to the Angioedema Adjudication Site Manual for additional details regarding the 
process for documenting and reporting angioedema -like events.

9.[ADDRESS_338552]. 
We would like to estimate the correlation coefficient with a precision (half -width of the 
confidence interval (CI)) of at least 0.15 for a 2-sided 95% CI in the intended subgroups of 
interest. The subgroups of interest are:  (1) subjects with HFrEF and “low” NT
-proBNP (<600 
if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277292] <400 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or “low” BNP (<150 if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], <100 if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) at baseline ( Ambros y 2012), (2) subjects with new onset HF and/or RAAS naïve 
(Fonarow 2010), and (3) subjects who are not receiving the target sacubitril/valsartan dose 
(McMurray  2014). It is estimated that these subgroups will represent approximately  25%, 20% 
and 30% of the study population, respectively.  Assuming, the population correlation 
coefficient of -0.35 ( Weiner 2013) for the overall study  sample and within each subgroup, the 
smallest sample size that would yield a precision of at least 0.15 for the estimated correlation 
coefficient would be n=13 3. Accounting for assumed 20% 
drop-out rate, 166 patients would 
be required. If the n=[ADDRESS_338553] (20% of the overall study 
population), an overall sample size of 830 would be required to enroll in this study . For any 
other subgroup with more than 166 patients will yield precision smaller than 0.15 for the 
estimated correlation coefficient. For the overall sample size of N=830 patients the precision 
of the estimate of correlation coefficient would be 0.07 ( PASS 2008
).
10 Ethical considerations

15 Appendix 3: Treatment guidelines for hy perkalemia (serum 
potassi um greater than or equal to 5.5 mEq/L)
General principles
Elevation of potassium levels above the predefined values should be repeated and confirmed 
before any action is taken.
Subjects with elevated potassium value will be managed according to the corrective actions 
outlined below and the investigator’s clinical judgment. Hyperkalemia should be followed 
until resolution.
Recommended corrective action for management of hy perkalemia
Serum potassium > 5.3 and less than or equal to 5.5 mEq/L
Confirm pot assium concentration in a non -hemoly zed sample
Reinforce low potassium diet and restriction of food/drinks with high potassium content 
(e.g. orange juice, melon, bananas, low -salt substitutes etc.) 
Review medical regimen (including dietary  supplements and over-the-counter medications) 
for agents known to cause hy perkalemia. Consider reduction in dose or discontinuation of 
these agents:
Aldosterone antagonists (if they  are believed to be the most likely  cause of 
hyperkalemia)
Potassium -sparing diuretics (e. g. amiloride and triamterene) including in combination 
products with thiazide or loop diuretics 
Potassium supplements, e.g., potassium chloride
Salt substitutes 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs)
Cyclo-oxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhibitors
Trimethoprim and trimethoprim -containing combination products, such as Bactrim®
and Septra®(trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole fixed combination)
Herbal Supplements:
For example, Noni juice, alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ), dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ), 
horsetail ( Equisetum arvense ), nettle ( Urtica dioica ), milkweed, lily  of the valley , 
Siberian ginseng, hawthorn berries
Repeat serum potassium measurement within 3 to 5 day s
If serum potassium remains > 5.3 and ≤ 5.5 mEq/L, regularly monitor serum potassium
levels to ensure stability  (suggested once monthly)
Consider down- titration of study  medication, according to investigator’s medical 
judgment.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 64

Serum potassium > 5.5 and < 6.0 mEq/L
Confirm potassium concentration in a non -hemoly zed sample 
Consider down- titration o r temporaril y discontinue study  drug according to investigator 
medical judgment. 
Apply  all measures outlined for serum potassium > 5.3 and ≤ 5.5 mEq/L
Repeat serum potassium measurement after 2 -3 day s
If serum potassium < 5.5 mEq/L , consider resumption of study  drug at lower dose with 
repeat potassium within 5 days
Serum potassium greater than or equal to 6.0 mEq/L
Immediately  discontinue study  drug
Confirm potassium concentration in a non -hemoly zed sample
Urgently  evaluate subject and treat hy perkalemia a s clinically  indicated 
Apply  all measures outlined for serum potassium > 5.3 and < 6.0 mEq/L
If serum potassium < 5.5 mEq/L , consider resumption of study  drug at lower dose with 
repeat potassium within 5 days

16 Appendix 4: Guidelines for the management of b lood 
pressure
Guidelines :
1.Investigator should monitor blood pressure closely 
2.If symptomatic hy potension occurs:
a.Correct an y treatable cause, e.g. h ypovolemia
b.If hypotension persists, any  antihy pertensive drug and non -disease -modify ing drugs, 
such as diure tics, CCBs, nitrates, and α -blockers, should be down -titrated or 
stopped first before down- titration of the study  drug is considered
3.If hypotension persists, the study drug should be down -titrated or even temporarily  
withdrawn. The dose re -challenge and me dication adjustment guidelines described in 
Section 5.4.5 should be adhered to as much as possible.

17 Appendix 5: Guidelines for the management of renal 
dysfunction
General principles:
Glomerular filtration rate in HF subjects depends on intrinsic renal function and on a balance 
between afferent and efferent glomerular arterial tonicity . This tonicity  is partly  regulated by  a 
stimulation of angiotensin II and could be affected by [CONTACT_277344]. Moreover, 
renal dysfunction may develop or may deteriorate in some subjects after study  drug 
administration. These recommendations have been developed to guide the investigators in 
managing subjects with renal d ysfunction after administration of study  drug.
Two types of response to serum creatinine increase are described:
Surveillance situation 
If, at any time after study  drug administration, eGFR decreases by ≥ 25% from baseline (or if 
serum creatinine concentration increase to 2.5 mg/dL [221 µmol/L ]), the investigator will 
check for potentiall y reversible causes of renal d ysfunction such as:
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drug intake, antibiotics, or other treatments known to 
affect creatininemia
Volume decrease, including that resulting from excessive dos ing of diuretics
Urinary  infection
Urinary  tract obstruction
Study  medication
Action situation 
If a subject eGFR decreases by ≥ 40% from baseline (or if serum creatinine concentration 
rises above 3 mg/dL (265 µmol/L), the investigator will check for poten tially  reversible 
causes of renal d ysfunction (see above).
If the investigator judges that study  medication has to be stopped, he/she will have to contact 
[CONTACT_146553]/her designee. Thereafter, serum creatinine assessments 
will have to be repeated at least each week until levels return to acceptable values. If study 
medication was stopped, every  effort will be done to restart it again, according to clinical 
conditions.

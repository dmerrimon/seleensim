2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 
 
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a pluripotent stem cell disor der characterized by 
[CONTACT_339120] (Ph) chromosome in the leukemic cells. The Ph chromosome results from a (9;22) translocation in which the c- ABL oncogene has 
moved from chromosome 9 into the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on 
chromosome 22, resulting in a chimeric BCR-ABL  gene 
1-3. This is the causative 
abnormality in CML. The fused gene encodes an 8.5 kb chimeric m RNA 4,5, which is 
translated into a 210-kDa protein 6. This p210 BCR-ABL protein functions as a 
constitutively activated tyrosin e kinase and is uniquely presen t in the leukemic cells of 
CML patients 7. The breakpoint in the BCR gene occurs either between BCR exon b2 
and b3 or between BCR exons b3 and b4. Therefore, in the mature BCR-ABL  mRNA, 
either b2 or b3 is spliced to ABL exon a2, which results in t wo alternative chimeric 
p210 BCR-ABL proteins, with eit her a B2A2 or B3A2 junction 8.  
 
2.2. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Therapy 
 
Imatinib is a low molecular weight phenylaminopyrimidine design ed to selectively 
inhibit BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity 9, and is now the standard therapy for newly 
diagnosed patients with CML who do not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant 10. 
2011-[ADDRESS_419143] shown that over 80% of p atients achieve a CCyR, 
with most of these responses being durable. After 7 years of follow-up, the event-free 
survival rate is 81% and the survival free from transformation to accelerated or blast  
phase is 92%.[ADDRESS_419144] ance or intolerance to imatinib , effective 
therapy with second generation ty rosine kinase inhibitors has b een developed. Two of 
these agents (dasatinib and niloitinib) are currently available , and others are under 
development (e.g, bosutinib). Approximately 50% of patients tre ated with these agents 
after imatinib failure achieve a CCyR, and these responses are also durable in most 
patients. 
 
Several reports have shown that, among patients who achieve a C CyR with imatinib or 
other TKI, those who achieve a MMR (ie, at 18 months from the start of therapy) have an improved EFS and survival free from transformation to accele rated or blast phase 
compared to those with CCyR but no MMR (7-year EFS 95% vs 86%, respectively).
[ADDRESS_419145] phase. Recently, it has been suggested that achieving a complete molecular response (CMR) further improves the long-term outcome  of patents after 
treatment with imatinib. In one series, patients who had an MMR  had a shorter relapse-
free survival (median 44 months) compared to those that achieve d CMR (median not 
reached, with a hazard ratio for relapse 11%.
[ADDRESS_419146] an estimate 
EFS at 7-years of 95%, compared to 85% for those with sustained  MMR but no CMR, 
and 50% for those with CCyR but no MMR.[ADDRESS_419147] already achieved a CCyR with TKI has becom e an important goal 
of therapy. It has been suggested  that patients who achieve CMR  may discontinue 
therapy with imatinib, an important goal for patients. However, discontinuation of imatinib among patient who achieve CMR results in relapse in ov er 50% of patients.
[ADDRESS_419148] suggested an association of hypermethylation 
with worse prognosis, although th is is still controversial.16-19 T h e  p 1 5  g e n e  i s  a l s o  
hypermethylated as CML progresses, with differential patterns o f hypermethylation for 
myeloid and lymphoid blastic phases.16  Hypermethylation of Caderin-13 may be 
associated with high-risk features in CML and with a lower prob ability of response to 
IFN-.[ADDRESS_419149] been  investigated in CML showing cl inical efficacy, 
although their use has been mostly limited to advanced stages o f the disease. 5-
azacitidine (AZA) was used in comb ination with chemotherapy (e. g., etoposide, 
mitoxantrone) for patients with CML in transformation, with 25%  to 60% responding

(i.e., back to chronic phase –BCP-).  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_339102] 14 patients with 
CML resulted in 2 responses (MDACC internal data). Decitabine has been more extensively studied in CML. It was first used for patients with  CML in transformation 
as a single agent at a dose of 50 to 100 mg/m
2 over 6 hours every 12 hours for 5 days 
every 4-8 weeks21. Twenty-eight of 51 (55%) patients treated in accelerated phas e and 
18 of 64 (28%) in myeloid blast  phase had a hematologic responses (CHR in 12 and 6, 
respectively). Cytogenetic responses were achieved in 14% and 8 %, respectively. 
Therapy was almost universally  myelosuppressive with infections  occurring in 34% of 
patients, with 4 (3%) treatment-related deaths. Subsequently, l ower doses have been 
used based the optimized demethylating effect with this schedule. In one study, decitabine was used at lower dos es until the minimal effective dose was reached. A 
dose of 15 mg/m
2 daily for 10 days (i.e., 15% to 30% of the dose previously use d) was 
well tolerated and provided the best response in a variety of m yeloid malignancies.[ADDRESS_419150] failed imatinib 
therapy (12 chronic, 17 accelerated, 6 blastic). A hematologic response was reported in 
23 (66%) patients (CHR 12, PHR 7, HI 4). Sixteen patients (46%)  had a cytogenetic 
response (major 6, minor 10).[ADDRESS_419151] shown synergy between 
imatinib and decitabine.24 25 This combination was used in a phase II trial in patients 
w i t h  a d v a n c e d  p h a s e  C M L ,  m o s t  o f  t h e m  p r e v i o u s l y  t r e a t e d  w i t h  i matinib. Patients 
received decitabine 15 mg/m2 intravenously daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks, and 
imatinib 600 mg orally daily. A hematologic response was achiev ed in 50% and 30% of 
patients in accelerated and blast phase, respectively, with maj or  cytogenetic responses 
in 33% and 20%, respectively.  We hypothesize that adding AZA to a TKI may improve the molecul ar response of 
patients with CML with CCyR but no MMR. If a significant number  of patients convert 
to a CMR, we will explore whether TKI can be safely discontinue d with minimal risk 
of relapse. Throughout the study we will measure the effect of therapy on DNA 
methylation in the peripher al blood and bone marrow, both globa l and gene-specific. 
 
2.4. 5-azacitidine 
 
Azacitidine, an analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine, h as effects on cell 
differentiation, gene expression,  and deoxyribonucleic acid (DN A) synthesis and 
metabolism.
26 Since the early 1970s, azacitidine has been investigated prima rily in the 
U S  f o r  t h e  t r e a t m e n t  o f  a c u t e  l e u k e m i a .  C l i n i c a l  s t u d i e s  h a v e  f ocused mainly on 
patients with disease refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Results of these 
investigations demonstrated activity of azacitidine in the trea tment of AML. Clinical 
studies subsequently evaluated the effects of azacitidine in a variety of other malignant 
and hematologic disorders, including solid tumors, hemoglobinopathies (eg, 
thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), and MDS. In 1984, the Canc er and Leukemia 
Group B (CALGB) began a series of clinical studies with azaciti dine in patients with 
MDS. These studies, in addition to other supportive data, led to the approval of Vidaza® (azacitidine) in Ma y 2004 for the treatment of MDS.

Azacitidine inhibits the methylation of newly synthesized DNA b y inhibiting DNA 
methyltransferase (DNMT).27-29 Increased methylation of DNA (hypermethylation) 
may result in the silencing of critical genes responsible for c ell growth control and 
differentiation. Hypermethylation of CpG islands spanning the promoter regions of 
tumor suppressor genes is commonly associated with cancers.[ADDRESS_419152],36 colorectal,37 non-small cell lung38 and hematologic malignancies.39 Azacitidine 
is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects through hypomet hylation and cytotoxicity 
on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.40-44 Hypomethylation may restore 
normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation.30,45,46 The 
cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_339103], including 
cancer cells that are no longer re sponsive to normal growth con trol mechanisms.40,47-49  
 
The cytotoxicity of azacitidine is proportional to dose and exp osure time.40,41 Although 
the mechanisms of cytotoxicity are complex and multifaceted, th ere is general 
agreement that incorporation of azacitidine into DNA and ribonu cleic acid (RNA), and 
inhibition of protein synthesis , are critically important.[ADDRESS_419153] in cells 
that are proliferating (S phase) and metabolically active.[ADDRESS_419154] during that period. The preclinical studies 
identified the bone marrow, liv er, kidneys, and lymphoid tissue s (spleen, lymph nodes, 
and thymus) as the main target organs of toxicity for azacitidi ne.51  In single-dose 
studies, the lethal dose of azacitidine after intravenous (IV) administration in mice, rats, 
and dogs was approximately 250 mg/m2. Repeated daily dosing appears to increase the 
toxicity of azacitidine.[ADDRESS_419155] with nucleic acids.51 Likewise, similar to other agents 
with cytostatic properties, azaci tidine was embryotoxic and red uced the reproductive 
performance in mice and rats.51 
 
Limited azacitidine pharmacokine tic data are currently availabl e. Based on human 
plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (which represents parent drug plus 
circulating metabolites), azacitidine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_165591] 
(SC), with maximum plasma concentrations found 0.5 to 2 hours a fter dosing.51 
Azacitidine and/or its by-products are then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_339104]. The half-
lives and percent radioactivity recovered in urine are similar following IV and SC 
routes of administration. The effects of renal or hepatic impai rment, gender, age, or 
race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studi ed.51 A single dose (75 
mg/m2) SC versus IV crossover study in 6 MDS subjects52 revealed an approximate 
bioavailability of 89% for the SC dose (range 52% to 128%) with  mean half-lives of 
0.[ADDRESS_419156] ively. These results 
demonstrated that azacitidine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_339105]

administration and that elimina tion is also rapid. The apparent  SC clearance (167 L/h or 
2791 mL/min) and systemic IV clearance (147 L/h) of azacitidine  exceeded the 
glomerular filtration rate (approximately 125 mL/min) and total  renal blood flow (1200 
mL/min) in healthy subjects. This indicates that non-renal elim ination (eg, metabolism, 
hydrolysis, and/or degradation) p lays a role in the elimination of parent azacitidine. In 
addition, azacitidine 75 mg/m2 was generally well-tolerated after single SC injection or 
IV infusion over [ADDRESS_419157] looked at different parenteral doses a nd schedules of 
azacitidine, finding maximum tolerated doses of up to 500 mg/m2 when administered 
weekly.53 
 
During the two decades between the start of the CALGB studies a nd the approval of 
azacitidine, a new understanding of MDS has developed, such as the World Health 
Organization (WHO) diagnostic crit eria, the International Progn ostic Scoring System 
(IPSS), and the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria. Silverman et al. reevaluated the combined data (N = 309) from 3 of the CALGB studies using the WHO classification system for MDS and AML and the IWG response crit eria.
54 Using the 
IWG response criteria in MDS pati ents, response rates were between 40% and 70% in 
azacitidine treated patients. Ten t o 17% of patients achieved a  complete remission; 
partial remission was rare; and 23% to 36% of patients had a he matologic 
improvement. In patients with AML (N = 103), 35% to 48% had hem atologic 
improvement or better responses. The median survival time for 2 7 patients assigned to 
azacitidine was 19.3 months compared with 12.9 months for the 2 5 patients assigned to 
observation.54 
 A randomized international Phase III trial (Study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) for h ig h er- risk  MD S  p atien ts,  cla ssif ied  b y  F A B  as R A E B ,  R AE B -T ,  o r  C MML w ith 0-
29% marrow blasts, with an IPSS of Intermediate -2 or High by [CONTACT_193403]/cytogenetic review was recently reported.
55 Patients were randomized to 
azacitidine (75 mg/m2/day x 7days in 28 day cycles) or conventional care regimens 
(CCR) , where CCR was pre-selected by [CONTACT_339121] 
(transfusions, antibiotics, and G-CSF for neutropenic infection ), low-dose cytarabine 
(20 mg/m2/day x 14 days in 28 day cycles); or standard chemotherapy (con ventional 
induction/consolidation). Patients were stratified by [CONTACT_339122]/IPSS and randomized 1:1 to 
azacitidine or CCR. This trial did not allow erythropoietin. Th ree-hundred fifty eight 
patients (70% male) were randomi zed at 79 centers to azacitidin e (N=179) or CCR 
(N=179): best supportive care only (N=105, 59%), low-dose cytarabine (N=49, 27%), 
or standard chemotherapy (N=25, 14%). Median age was 69 years ( range 38-88 years). 
The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline pat ient characteristics. 
At baseline, 95% of patients were higher risk: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T/WHO AML (34%), CMML (3%), and other (5%). By [CONTACT_56623], 87% were higher risk: Intermediate -2 (40%), High (47%), and 13% Indeterminate/other. Azacitidine was  administered for a 
median of 9 cycles; low-dose cyta rabine for 4 cycles. Median fo llow-up for the survival 
analysis was 21.1 months. Azacitidine demonstrated statisticall y superior overall 
survival compared to CCR, with a median overall survival of 24. 4 months vs. 15

months for CCR (stratified log-rank p=0.0001, hazard ration 0.5 8). Two-year survival 
approximately doubled in the azacitidine arm compared to CCR: 5 1% vs. 26% 
(p<0.0001). Azacitidine was well tolerated with safety data con sistent with previous 
reports.  
 
Further details can be found in the azacitidine Investigator’s Brochure, which contains 
comprehensive pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharm acodynamics, 
metabolism, preclinical, and clinical efficacy and safety data information.51

4. Treatment Plan 
 
4.1. TKI: Patients will continue receiving TKI at the dose they had bee n receiving during 
the last 6 months.  
 
4.2.AZA:  
Phase I: patients will be treated in cohorts of 3. The starting dose will be dose level 0 
(50 mg/m2/d x 3 days subcutaneous or intravenous; Table 1). 
4.2.1. At least [ADDRESS_419164] not experienced a DLT will be replaced. 
Table 1: Dose escalation levels  
Dose level AZA (mg/m2/d x 3 days)

3 75 (for 7 days) 
 
4.2.2. Dose escalation will be done as follows: 
D o s e - l i m i t i n g  t o x i c i t y  i n   R e s u l t      
0 / 3      E s c a l a t e  t o  n e x t  l e v e l  
 
1 / 3      E n t e r  3 more patients 
 
2/3 or > 2/6 MTD exceeded. This dose level will be 
declared the maximally administered dose. 
Expand previous level to include a total of 6 patients if not already accrued to this number.  
 
4.2.3. Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. DLT will be defined by [CONTACT_339124] a nd 
possibly related to study drug occurring during the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) of therapy. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Non-hematologic DLT is defined as grade 3 or 4 toxicity (NCI common criteria, version 4.0) that is clinically significant an d 
2011-[ADDRESS_419165] possibly related to the study drug. G rade 3 
or 4 nausea, vomiting and diarrhea will be considered DLT only if 
not controlled by [CONTACT_185986]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Grade 3 biochemical abnormalities (e.g., lipase or bilirubin 
elevation) will only be considered DLT if accompanied by [CONTACT_339125].  Grade 3 or 4 elec trolyte abnormalities will only  b e  
considered DLT if possibly related to study drug and not correc ted 
by [CONTACT_339126]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematologic DLT is defined as grade 3 neutropenia and/or 
thrombocytopenia with a hypocellu lar bone marrow lasting for 6 
weeks or more after the start of  a course. (In case of a normoc ellular 
bone marrow, 8 weeks with pancytopenia will be considered DLT).  
Anemia will not be considered for the definition of DLT. 
 
4.2.4. If dose-level 0 exceeds MTD, subs equent patients will be treate d at dose level -
1. Additional cohorts at lower  doses (down to dose level -4) ma y be included if 
higher doses exceed MTD. If dose level -4 exceeds MTD, the stud y will be 
terminated.   
 
4.3. Phase II: The dose to be used for the phase II portion of the study is 75 mg/m2 daily for 
3 days, unless MTD is defined at a lower dose level in the phas e I portion of the study 
in which case that would become the dose to be used for the phase II portion. Other dose levels shown in Table 1 will be used for dose adjustments for toxicity or lack of 
improvement (as described in se ction 4.5.5) during therapy. For phase II portion of the 
study, if at any time patients nee d to be escalated to dose lev el +2 or +3, if at any time 
33% or more of patients experience DLT at this dose level durin g the first cycle they 
receive at this dose, this would be considered to have exceeded  M T D  a n d  t h a t  d o s e  
level should not be used any further.   
 4.4. Treatment with AZA (in both phase I and phase II) may be repeat ed every 28 days. The 
start of subsequent cycles may be  delayed to allow for recovery  of any adverse events 
to grade 1 or less. 
 
4.5. Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
 
4.5.1. Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity directly attributab le to the study drugs 
should temporarily stop treatment according to the guidelines i n the dose 
adjustment schema.  
 4.5.2. Toxicity grading will be according to the NCI CTCAE, v4. To prevent unnecessary morbidity, the following guidelines for dose adjust ment for drug-
related toxicities  are recommended.  
 
2011-0254 
April 24, 2014 
Page 11 of 28 
4.5.3. TKI: dose modifications will be done according to institutional guid elines. The 
following guidelines may be used for dose adjustments: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-Hematologic Toxicity 
 Grade 2:  Patients with persistent grade [ADDRESS_419166] treatment held until the toxicity has resolve d to 
grade <1.  TKI may then be resumed at the same dose the patient  
was receiving at the time treatment was interrupted. If the gra de 2 
toxicity recurs, TKI may be held until the toxicity has resolve d to

140 mg/d, nilotinib 800 mg (us ually as 400 mg BID), and 
imatinib 800 mg. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modifications of dose schedules o ther than the above will be al lowed 
within the following guidelines: 
 Further dose reductions can be m ade to keep toxicity grade ≤2.  
 Dose adjustments by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_419167] of the patient (e.g., 
neutropenia with sepsis, bleedi ng requiring platelet transfusio ns) 
when toxicity has resolved.  
 A patient who has had a dose reduction because of any reason ma y 
have their dose re-escalated provided the patient has remained free

4.5.5. Dose Escalation : Patients that do not achieve an improvement in molecular 
response after 3 months (eg., from  major to complete or from no n-major to major) 
and have experienced no grade ≥[ADDRESS_419172] dose escalati on of AZA within 2 months of this escalation. 
 4.5.6. Occasional missed doses of TKI w ill not be considered a deviati on.  Missed dosed 
of ≥ 2 weeks without adequate justification will be considered a protocol 
deviation. 
 
4.5.7. Duration of Therapy: Patients may receive therapy for six cycles. After 
completion of the 6

6. Criteria for Response 
 
6.1. A favorable response for the primary endpoint is defined as a greater than a one-log 
reduction of BCR-ABL transcript levels from the baseline level at the time vaccination 
was initiated, or a disappearan ce of BCR-ABL transcripts (i.e., complete molecular 
response).  
2011-[ADDRESS_419174] but which does not necessarily ha ve a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
 
Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and 
which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, dia gnosis, or therapy of 
disease or for the modifica tion of physiologic function.  
 Assessing causal connections betw een agents and disease is fund amental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may  be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not bee n administered, 1) the 
event would not have happened at all, 2) the event would have o ccurred later than it 
actually did, or 3) the event w ould have been less severe. 
 The Investigator or physician desi gnee is responsible for verifying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse ev ents and assigning the attribution for each event for all 
subjects enrolle d on the trial. 
 
8.2. Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the latest CTC version and 
documented in medical record.  Only unexpected AEs will be reco rded in the Case 
Report Form (CRF).  Expected eve nts during leukemia therapy are :

reported per course on the case report form. 
 8.4. Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of  the following outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experi ence that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adver se experience that, 
had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767]  a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient o r subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such me dical events include allergic br onchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dysc rasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the develop ment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be consider ed serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND 
Office. 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeti ng the definition 
of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the tim eframes and 
procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reportin g Unanticipated 
Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, 
all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND O ffice, regardless 
of attribution (with in 5 working days of knowledge of the event ). 
 All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study 
drug, must have a written report sub
mitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the Safet y Project Manager in the IND  Office.  
2011-0254 
April 24, 2014 
Page 19 of 28 
 Unless otherwise noted, the elec tronic SAE application (eSAE) w ill be utilized for 
safety reporting to the IND  Office and MDACC IRB.  
 Serious adverse events will be c aptured from the time of the fi rst protocol-specific 
intervention,  until [ADDRESS_419175] be reported to the IND Offi ce. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_270506] (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) a ccording to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_270473] s, Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelin es, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional 
Review Board policy.  
 
8.5. Annual Reports 
 
If the FDA has granted an IND number, it is a requirement of 21  CFR 312.33, that an 
annual report is provided to the FDA within 60-days of the IND anniversary date.  21 
CRF 312.33 provides the data elements that are to be submitted in the report.  The 
Annual Report should be filed in  the study's Regulatory Binder,  and a copy provided to 
Celgene Corporation as a supporter of this study as follows.

8.6. Pregnancies: 
 
Pregnancy of a female subject or the female partner of a male s ubject  occurring while 
the subject is on azacitidine or within [ADDRESS_419177]’s last dose of 
Azacitidine are considered expedited reportable events.  If the  subject is on Azacitidine, 
it is to be discontinued immediately.  The pregnancy must be re ported to Celgene Drug 
Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the p regnancy by [CONTACT_339129]. 
2011-[ADDRESS_419178] notify Celgene Drug Safety of the outcome as specified bel ow.  The Investigator 
will provide this information as a follow-up to the initial SAE . 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a 
SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [a ny congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is 
to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital an omaly), the Investigator 
should follow the procedures for Expedited Reporting of SAEs to  Celgene (i.e., report 
the event to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours o f the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event). 
Any suspected fetal exposure to A zacitidine must be reported to  Celgene within 24 
hours of being made aware of the event.  The pregnant female sh ould be referred to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist experien ced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation 
and counseling. 
All neonatal deaths that occur w ithin [ADDRESS_419179] to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death af ter 30 days that the 
Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to Az acitidine should also be 
reported. 
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Drug Safety shoul d be advised as soon as 
the information is available.

9. Statistical Considerations 
 
9.1. This is a single arm, open label, phase I-II trial to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of 
the combination of AZA and a TKI in CML patients in complete cy togenetic remission 
with minimal residual disease. A total of 48 patients will be a ccrued at a rate of 1 to 2 
patients per month.  
 
9.2. Phase I 
2011-0254 
April 24, 2014 
Page 21 of 28 
The primary objective of phase I part is to determine the maxim um tolerated dose 
(MTD) of AZA; and the primary endpoint is the occurrence of dos e-limiting toxicity 
(DLT: section 4.3.3) within the first course of treatment. Stan dard 3+3 design will be 
used. The starting dose is 50 mg/m2/d x 3 days (Table 1).  
Table 1: Dose escalation levels 
Dose level AZA (mg/m2/d x 3 days)

9.2.1. The 3+3 algorithm is described below: 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Three patients will be enrolled at the starting dose level  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. I f  0 / 3  p a t i e n t  e x p e r i e n c e s  D L T  a t  a  g i v e n  l e v e l ,  e n r o l l  t h r e e  
patients to the next higher dose level  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. If 1/3 patient experiences DLT at a given level, enroll additio nal 
three patients to the same dose level  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. If 2/3 or 2/[ADDRESS_419181] AZA level of 75 mg/m2/d x 3 days will be used 
as the recommended phase II dose. 
 
A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for phase I part. The data from the 
6 patients treated at the recomm ended phase II dose level (MTD or 75 
mg/m2/d x 3 days if MTD is not determined) will be used in phase II part. 
 
9.3. Phase II 
The primary endpoint for phase II portion is the decrease of tr anscript levels by [CONTACT_339130] (or undetectable transcript level) within 12 months. In cluding the 6 patients 
treated at the recommended phase II dose level in the phase I part, a total of 36 patients 
will be accrued.  
2011-0254 
April 24, 2014 
Page 22 of 28 
9.3.1. Efficacy Monitoring 
Since the efficacy of the drug will be assessed over a long per iod of time (12 
months) and the accrual rate is relatively fast (1-2 patients p er month), no 
formal futility monitoring rule will be applied. However, the P I and the study 
committee will meet regularly, and the study will be stopped ea rly if 
consensus has been reached on any clear indications of poor eff icacy of the 
drug. 
9.3.2. Toxicity Monitoring The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey will be used to perform i nterim safety 
monitoring [1].  The safety monitoring of the trial will be initiated after the 
first [ADDRESS_419182] been evaluated, and then monitored contin uously. The 
monitoring rule for toxicity is P( 
E>0.20|data)>0.90, where E i s  t h e  
proportion of any DLT (as defined in section 4.3.3), and is ass umed to follow 
a non-informative prior of Beta (0.4, 1.6). Namely, the trial will be terminated 
if at any time during the study th ere is a more than 90% chance  that the 
average rate of DLT is more th an 20%.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_339114] 3out of 6, 4 out of 7, 5 out of 10, 6 out of 14, 7 out of 18, 8 out of 
22,  9 out of 26,   10 out of 30,  11 out of 34 patients experienced DLT.

withdraw within 12-months after initiation of treatment will be  counted as failure in the 
primary efficacy analysis.  
The rate of molecular response will be estimated with 95% confi dence interval. The 
null hypothesis is that the response rate is 5%, and alternative hypothesis is that the 
response rate is 20%. If a 20% response is reached, the study w ould be considered 
positive. Under this setting, 36 patients can provide a power o f 87% for a one-sided test 
of the above hypothesis at sig nificance level alpha=5%. 
10. Protocol Amendments, Deviations and Regulatory  
 
Any amendment to this protocol  must be agreed to by [CONTACT_339131].  Amendments should only be submitted to IRB 
after consideration of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Celgene re view.  Written verification 
of IRB approval will be obtained b efore any amendment is implem ented.   
 
10.1. Protocol Deviations 
 
When an emergency occurs that requires a deviation from the pro tocol for a subject, a 
deviation will be made only for that subject.  A decision will be made as soon as 
possible to determine whether or not the subject (for whom the deviation from 
protocol was effected) is to co ntinue in the study.  The subjec t’s medical records will 
completely describe the deviation from the protocol and state t he reasons for such 
deviation.  In addition, the Investigator will notify the IRB i n writing of such 
deviation from protocol. 
10.2. Investigator Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities are  set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulations. 
 Investigators must enter study data into MDACC’s PDMS.  The Investigator will 
permit study-related monitoring visits and audits by [CONTACT_339132]  i t s  r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s ,  
IRB/EC review, and regulatory in spection(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), providing 
direct access to the facilitie s where the study took place, to source documents, to 
CRFs, and to all other study documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available 
at some time during monitoring visits to review data and resolv e any queries and to 
allow direct access to the subject’s records (e.g., medical records, office charts, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study relate d charts) for source data veri f i c a t i o n .   T h e  d a t a  
collection must be completed prior to each visit and be made av ailable to the Celgene 
representative so that the accu racy and completeness may be che cked.

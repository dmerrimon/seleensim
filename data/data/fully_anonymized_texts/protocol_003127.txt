with clinically  significant fibrosing Interstitial L ung Disease
Coordinating 
Investigator
[INVESTIGATOR_507266] -centre trial conducted in approximately  24countries .
Clinical phase III
Trial rationale Some patients with childhood intersti tial lun gdisease ( chILD)
develop chronic lung fibrosis similar to adults with fibrosing lung 
disease, which is associated with significant morbidity  and mortalit y. 
There are currently  no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_507267] .
Based on the presumed similarities in underly ing pathophy siology  
resulting in fibrotic remodelling in adults and children, it is 
postulated that matching the dose exposure of nintedanib in children 
will lead to similar anti-fibrotic effect s and clinical benefits in 
paediatric patients with fibrosing lung disease as demonstrated in 
adult s wit h IPF and SSc -ILD.
As a powered efficacy  study  is not feasible ,a focused 
pharmacokinetic (PK)and safet y evaluation of nintedanib in 
children with clinicall y significant chronic fibrosing lung disease is 
planned to determine appropriate paediatric dosing of nintedanib in 
children and adolescent sand to address this unmet need .
Trial objective(s) The main objective of the study  is to evaluate dose -exposure and 
safet y of nintedanib in children and adolescents with fibrosing ILD .
Trial endpoints Primary  endpoints:
PK: AUCτ,ss based on sampling at stead y state ( at week 2 
and week 26);
N(%) of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events at 
week 24.

(**) Patients who discontinue trial treatment prematurely should undergo the End of Treatment (EoT) visit as soon as possible , and follow  the trial schedule thereafter, 
if possible . The patient will be asked to attend all visits (except for the laboratory a-visits) as originally planned until the end of the trial. Please also seeFlow  
Chart footnote 18 for instructions ,should the patient be unable to complete the scheduled visits; see Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_654556] visit after the EoT visit will be skipped if theEoT visit occurs within 4 w eeks prior to scheduled visit.
Patients who did not discontinue trial treatment prematurely should undergo the EoT visit as soon as t he timing of final DBL (DBL 2) and EoT visit has been
communicated (see Section 3.1 for details) . If a regular study visit is scheduled in the period when the EoT visit should be conducted, all procedures required at 
this regular study visit and the additional procedures, if any, required at the EoT visit will be conducted during the same visit .
(***) After the EoT visit, patient s who completed the treatment period according to protocol will enter a 4- week follow -up period, unless they roll -over into an open 
label extension trial. See Section 3.1 for details.
(****)Weeks and Days from theDay of Random isation , i.e. Day of first intake of randomised medication (D 1) .
1Informed consent (and assent where applicable) will be obtained before any procedure related to the study. When it is obtaine d before Visit 1, e.g. to allow  shipment of 
images for central review, all Adverse Events ( AEs) and Concomitant Treatments occurring after the informed consent have to be recorded , including those occurred 
betw een informed consent and Visit 1 . The interval between Visit 1 and Visit 2 should be ≤28 days .Theinterval betw een Visit 1 and Visit 2 could be >28 days in case 
the assessments required to check inclusion and exclusion criteria cannot be completed within 28 days (e.g. in case the available HRCT scan fails to meet the required 
image acquisition specificatio n, laboratory test results show  out-of-range values requiring re test, etc. ) but the screening period (informed consent to Visit 2) must not be 
longer than 12 w eeks. Upon obtaining informed consent, the patient and parent(s) /legal guardian will be instructed on procedures to be follow ed until the next study 
visit.
2Central review of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for meeting inclusion criteria. HRCT should not be older than [ADDRESS_654557] scan fails to meet the required image acquisition specification (see image acquisition guideline in the ISF) , a 
new HRCT can be performed for the purposes of participation in the trial, provided the patient meets a ll other in -/exclusion criteria. For details about HRCT and biopsy 
review see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
3Measurements of vital signs should precede blood sampling ; except at Visit 3 and Visit 7 (as blood sampling for PK w ill start upon patient’s arrival ).
4At each time point, height and sitting height will be assessed three times and each assessment will be recorded into the patient’s files and transcribed into the electronic 
Case Report Form ( eCRF ). An average of the 3 measurement s will be calculated. Height and w eight will be repeated at follow -up in case of clinically relevant changes 
at EoT. Height and weight assessed in the 2 years prior to screening (Visit 1) w ill also be collected , if available .
5Electrocardiogram ( ECG )at rest (if possible prior to blood sampling ) will be performed at Visit 1. It w ill be repeated at Visit 2 prior to randomization only if abnormal 
at Visit 1, and at visits specified in the Flow Chart thereafter.
6Safety laboratory tests will be conducted on blood and urine. Tests w ill be repeated at follow -up(unless patients roll-over into theopen label extension trial ) in case of 
clinically relevant changes at EoT .
7The safety laboratory tests of Visit [ADDRESS_654558] be repeated if scree ning is longer than 6 w eeks.
8Intermediate lab tests (“a” Visit) will be done as needed for additional safety monitoring at the discretion of the investigator, or as recommended by [CONTACT_144278] ( SMC ). Laboratory kits forblood and urine sampling done locally (e.g. by [CONTACT_507339] a nurse) and for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_507270]. Analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_12115].

12Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) should be notified upon obtaining informed consent, at Visit [ADDRESS_654563] -dose (see Flow Chart for PK blood sampling for details). In exceptional 
cases, where extensive PK sampling is not possible and only in paediatric patients with an age < 12 years, a sparse sampling approach might be applied w ith a minimum 
blood sampling before (PTM of -0:05), 1 h (+/ -15 min) and 3 h (+/ -15 min) after nintedanib administration. Date and exact clock time of drug administration and blood 
sampling must be recorded in the eCRF. The p atient and parent(s)/ legal guardian will be provided (Visit 2 and Visit 6) with a PK diary card to suppo rt the record of the 
exact clock time of medication intake on the three days preceding PK sampling. At the beginning of the PK sampling visit (Visit 3 and Visit 7) the site personnel will 
check the PK diary card and confirm that the trial medication has been taken in the three days preceding the visit. If this is not confirmed, the visit will be rescheduled .
14At this visit drug accountability is to be completed only in case of dose reduction / increase.
15The PedsQL ™ questionnaire should always be admini stered in a quiet place prio r to any other visit procedure .
16Bone imaging ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI )examination ; if MRI cannot be performed, x -ray assessment) will be conducted in all patients who qualified for 
randomisation at baseline. Im aging follow -up will be conducted only in patients with open physes at 12 w eeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 52 w eeks and every 24 w eeks
thereafter until the end of the study or closure of the physes. At EoT the MRI/x -ray should not be repeated if the last MRI/x -ray wasconducted within [ADDRESS_654564] year, 24 w eeks thereafter.
Dental examination (clinical) will be conducted in all patients who qualified for randomisation at baseline . Follow-up will be conducted in all patients at [ADDRESS_654565] examination was 
conducted within 12 w eeks.
Dental imaging (panoramic x -ray) will be conducted in all patients who qualified for randomisation at baseline. Follow -up will be conducted in all patients at [ADDRESS_654566] dental imaging was conducted w ithin 24

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Childhood interstitial lung disease (ch ILD) comprises a complex and heterogeneous spectrum 
of rare respi[INVESTIGATOR_507274] [ P19-[ZIP_CODE]] associated with 
varying prognosis. There is scant data in the literature on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_507275]. Overall, the prevalence of paediatric ILD is considered to be substantially  lower than in 
adults 
[R11-5060, R12-0299 ,R12- 0358, R12- 0974 ,R14-4379 ,R17-2810 ,R17-2902 ,R17-
2907 ,R03-2090 ,R03-2075 ,P16-[ZIP_CODE]], ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 per million [ R12- 2794 ,
R16-4790 ,R17-2776 ] and incidence rates ranging from 1.32 to 162 per million person- years 
for children [ R16-1141, R12- 0299, R18- 1147].
Similar to adults with ILD, some of whom can develop a progressive phenoty pecharacterized 
by [CONTACT_507341] s ymptoms, lung function decline and increased morbidity  [P17- [ZIP_CODE]] , some 
patients with chILD develop chronic lung fibrosis that is associated with significant 
morbidity  and mortality .Although some ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis [ RA]-ILD) can occur 
in both children and adults, certain ILDs occur more frequentl y in children (e.g. surfactant 
protein deficiency ) [R16-4788] while others are almost exclusively  found in adults (e.g. IPF). 
As a result, the composition of the clinical diagnoses associated with lung fibrosis in 
paediat ricpatients, though overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_507276]. Potential paediatric 
conditions likely  to be associated with fibrosing ILD include , but are not limited to ,the 
following:
surfactant protein deficiency  (SFTPC and ATP binding cassette subfamil y A member 
3 [ABCA3 ]mutations); 
chronic h ypersensitivity  pneumonitis (cHP); 
toxic/radiation/drug induced pneumonitis; 
post hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) fibrosis;
connective tissue disease related disorders (e.g. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [ RA]/ 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Systemic Sclerosis [SSc]
,dermatomy ositis/poly myositis 
[DM/PM ]; mixed connective tissue disease [MCTD]) a nd sarcoidosis .
There are currently  no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_507277].
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Mode of action
Nintedanib is a ty rosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR ) 1–3, platelet -derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR )α and β, and vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR 1–3) involved in fibrotic mechanisms active in 
patients with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases. In addition, nintedanib inhibits ly mphocy te-
specific t yrosine -protein kinase (Lck) , tyrosine -protein kinase ly n(Lyn), proto -oncogene 
tyrosine- protein kinase (Src) [P08-[ZIP_CODE]] and colony -stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) 
kinases [ P18-[ZIP_CODE]]. Nintedanib binds competitively to the Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP )
binding pocket of these kinases and blocks the intracellular signalling cascades, which have 
been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling in

human lung and skin fibroblasts from patients with I PF and SSc -ILD and the release of 
extracellular matrix protein [ P14-[ZIP_CODE], P14 -[ZIP_CODE] , P15-[ZIP_CODE], P14- [ZIP_CODE], P16 - [ZIP_CODE], 
P17-[ZIP_CODE] , P18 - [ZIP_CODE]]. In addition nintedanib attenuated cellular processes assumed to be 
involved in the initiation and progression of fibrosis, the release of pro -fibrotic mediators 
from peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) [ P17-[ZIP_CODE]] and the polarisation of 
macrophages to alternatively  activated pro -fibrotic macrophages [ P17-[ZIP_CODE]]. Ni ntedanib 
was effective in attenuating the progressive fibrotic lung pathology  in animal models of lung 
fibrosis independent of the initial trigger, chemical, environm
ental, immunologic or 
transcriptional [ P17-[ZIP_CODE], P14 - [ZIP_CODE], P15 - [ZIP_CODE], P17 - [ZIP_CODE], P18 - [ZIP_CODE]] suggesting a 
preclinical rationale to treat patients with lung fibrosis related to different underly ing 
diseases.
Key pharmacokinetic characteristics
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of nintedanib have been evaluated in adults , for which a
summary  is provided in the following paragraph. For a more detailed description of the 
nintedanib profile in ILD please refer to the curren t Investigator’s Brochure (IB) Nintedanib 
in Idiopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis, Sy stemic Sclerosis, Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial L ung 
Disease [c01783972-16].
A soft gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in humans. Maximum plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) occur between [ADDRESS_654591] within one week of dosing. The absolute bioavailability of nintedanib is 
slightly  below 5%. After food intake, a trend towards an increased s ystemic exposure (around 
20%) and a delay ed absorption is observed compared to administration under fasted 
conditions. Therefore nintedanib is recommended to be taken with food. Nintedanib is 
preferentiall y distributed in plasma with a blood to plasma ratio of 0.87 ;the terminal half -life 
is in the range of 7 to 19 h. Nintedanib is mainly  eliminated via faeces (~93%), with minimal 
renal excretion (0.7%) .
Drug interactions
Patients taking potent P -gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ery thromy cin or cy closporine) 
should be monitored closely  for tolerabilit y of nintedanib. Management of side effects may 
require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therap y with nin tedanib ( see 
Section 4.1.2 and Table 4.1.2:2) [ U10-1991, U13 - 1504, U13-1506, U13 -1925 , c02153150].
Potent P -gp inducers (e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phen ytoin, and St. John ’s Wort) may  
decrease exposure to nintedanib. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or 
minimal P -gp inductio n potential should be considered [ U13-1478-01, U13 - 1506 , 
c02153150].
For specific restrictions of concomitant medication please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Residual Effect P eriod
The Residual Effect P eriod (REP) of nintedanib for the paediatric programme is 28 day s.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654592]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018Data from non -clinical studies
The antifibrotic effects of nintedanib have been demonstrated in various animal models of 
lung fibrosis, resembling features of idiopathic pulmonary  fibrosis (IPF) [P17-[ZIP_CODE], P18 -
[ZIP_CODE] ], hypersensitivity  pneumonitis (HP) [P18-[ZIP_CODE] ], silicosis [P17-[ZIP_CODE] ], systemic 
sclerosis associated ILD (SSc -ILD) [P17-[ZIP_CODE]] and rheumatoid arthritis associated ILD 
(RA- ILD) [P18-[ZIP_CODE]].
Data from c linical studies
Based on the demonstrated pre -clinical effects noted above, the potential benefits of 
nintedanib have been investigated in adults with idiopathic pulmonary  fibrosis [ P14-[ZIP_CODE] ],
SSc-ILD [P17-[ZIP_CODE] , P19-[ZIP_CODE] ],andprogressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-
ILD) [ P17-[ZIP_CODE] , P19-[ZIP_CODE]].
Results from the I PF and SSc -ILD programme in adults show nintedanib to be associated 
with statistically  significant and clinicall y meaningful slowing of the progressive decline in 
lung function as measured by  [CONTACT_507342] 1 year. 
In the phase III study  performed to investigate the efficacy  and safet y of nintedanib in 
subjects with non- IPF chronic fibrosing ILD s that were progressive despi[INVESTIGATOR_507278] (
Trial 1199.247, INBUILD®) [P17-[ZIP_CODE]] , nintedanib 
significantl y reduced the progression of fibrosing ILD, as measured by  [CONTACT_507343] (FVC) over 52 weeks compared with placebo inboth in the 
overall population and in the co
-primary  population of subjects with a usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP) -like fibrotic pattern on HRCT. Compared with placebo, relative reductions 
of the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks of 57% in the overall population, 61% in 
patients with HRCT with UI P-likefibrotic pattern was observed. Consistent results were 
obtained in the complementary population of patients with HRCT with other fibrotic patterns
[P19-[ZIP_CODE]]. Although the INBUILD®trial was not powered to study  individual ILDs, 
subgroup anal yses suggested that nintedanib had a consistent effect on FVC decline across 
diagnostic groups. The effect of nintedanib versus placebo on reducing the rate of FV C 
decline (mL/ year) was consistent across subgroups by  [CONTACT_507344] 
[P20-
[ZIP_CODE]].
The most commonly  reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders. Of those, the most 
frequent events were diarrhoea, nau sea, and vomiting. Most of these events were of mild or 
moderate intensit y, reported as non- serious, and were managed by  [CONTACT_507345]/or temporary  interruption and/or reduction of the nintedanib dose. Diarrhoea, nausea, 
vomiting, which may lead to dehy dration and/or electrolyte disturbances, and abdominal pain 
are considered adverse reactions of nintedanib treatment in adults. More patients in the 
nintedanib group than in the placebo group reported weight and appetite decrease as AEs. 
Weight de creased and appetite decrease are considered adverse drug reactions of nintedanib 
treatment.
Cases of drug- induced liver injury  (DILI) have been observed with nintedanib treatment in 
adults. The majority  of hepatic events occur within the first three months of treatment , 
therefore hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels should be investigated upon the initiation

and periodicall y thereafter or as clinicall y indicated.
Considering that VEGFR inhibition might potentially  be associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding, patients at known risk for bleeding or who required fibrinoly sis, full -dose 
therapeutic anticoagulation, or high dose antiplatelet therapy  have been excluded from 
participation in the nintedanib trials, and initiation of an y of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_507279] .

This study  is part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PI P) agreed with EMA for nintedanib 
in the treatment of chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenot ype.
The study  is conducted in patients [ADDRESS_654594] of a confirmatory  efficacy  study  is deemed not feasible based on the low 
disease prevalence in children , a focused PK and safet y evaluation of nintedanib in children 
and adolescents with clinically  significant fibrosing interstitial lung diseas e is planned. Due 
to small patient numbers, a basket approach [P17-[ZIP_CODE], R18 - 2970 ]will be used to group 
children a nd adolescents according to demonstrated evidence of lung fibrosis and clinical 
disease severity  irrespective of clinical diagnosis to optimise feasibility . Supportive data on 
efficacy  in the proposed paediatric program mewill be collected to support inferences of 
clinical benefit and evaluation of the benefit- risk of nintedanib in the target population.
1.3.[ADDRESS_654595] been shown to be fundamental 
processes in the common final path of fibrotic rem odelling and several diseases resulting in 
lung fibrosis including IPF, chronic HP, SSc -ILD and RA -ILD [ c01783972 -16]. As such, the 
prevailing underl ying hypothesis is that a similar final common pathway  in fibrosing ILDs 
can b e targeted with nintedanib and lead to clinical benefit (see pharmacologic rationale). 
Accordingl y, clinical programmes with nintedanib have targeted patients with presumed 
similarities in pathophy siology  based on demonstrated evidence of chronic fibrosing lung 
disease, irrespective of the underl ying trigger [P17-[ZIP_CODE]; P17- [ZIP_CODE]].

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654596]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018While there is overlap between clinical diagnoses associated with lung fibrosis in paediatrics
and adults, some diagnoses associated with lung fibrosis are specific to each population. The 
following paediatric conditions can be most frequently  associated with lung fibrosis in 
paediatrics : 
surfactant protein deficiency  (SFTPC and ABCA3 mutations [
i.e. recessive disorder, 
suspected pathogenic variants or deletion/disruption] );
chronic h ypersensitivity  pneumonitis (cHP);
toxic/radiation and drug induced pneumonitis;
post h aematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) fibrosi s;
connective tissue disease re lated disorders (e.g. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [RA]/ 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, SSc, dermatomy ositis/poly myositis [DM/PM ]; mixed 
connective tissue d isease [MCTD])
sarcoidosis.
In addition to difference in clinical diagnoses associated with fibrosing lung disease, the 
clinical course of fibrotic lung disease also differs between paediatrics and adults.
The data on the natural history  of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease in children is 
limited. The available evidence suggests overall that
the clinical course is associated with 
better outcome compared to adult ILDs with survival at 2, 4 and 5 years after s ymptom onset 
reported to be 83%, 72% and 64%, respectivel y [R09-5337]. This is compared to a median 
survival of 2.5–3.5 y ears from diagnosis in I PF [P11-[ZIP_CODE]], the most progressive form of 
fibrosing lung disease in adults. However, as previously  mentioned there is a subgroup of 
children wit h fibrosing lung disease who experience sign ificant morbidity  and mortality  
[R09-5337].
Accelerated decline in lung function over time is one of the key  clinical findings in adults 
with fibrotic ILDs and is considered one of the best predictors of disease progression and
mortality  [R10-6539, R06- 4127 ,R10-2727 ,P12-[ZIP_CODE], R14- 1149 ,R12-3648 ,R14-1150 ,
R06-4129 , R17-1625 , R18-3409 , R18-3555 ]. Other independent predictors of mortality  that 
have been identified in adults with fibrosing lung disease include older age, male gender, 
worse pulmonary  function and radiological or histopathological extent of fibrosis, as well as 
presence of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT [ P06-[ZIP_CODE] ,R16-0754,
R16-0756 ,R16-0758 ,R16-0752 ,R16-0755 ,R16-0560 ]. While there is limited data in 
paediatrics, a study  assessed predictors of survival in a small cohort of children with various 
fibrosing ILDs and found a severit y-of-illness score based on s ymptoms and oxy genation to 
be significantly  asso ciated with decreased survival [ R09-5337]. There is limited data on serial 
lung function in children with fibrosing ILD available in the literature. Clinical parameters 
such as weight, crackles, digital clubbing, sy mptom duration or family  history  were not fou nd 
to be associated with survival. As such, evaluation of clinical lysignificant disease and 
evaluation of potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_507280] y.

1.4.1 Benefits
Based on a comprehensive clinical deve lopment programme inadult patients
with 3 phase II 
and III studies in IPF (TOMORROW®, INPUL SIS1®and INPULSIS 2®),1 phase III study  in 
SSc-ILD (SENSCI S®)
[P17-[ZIP_CODE]], and 1 phase III study  in chronic fibrosing interstitial 
lung disease with progressive phenoty pe (INBUILD®) [P17-[ZIP_CODE]], nintedanib has been
approved for the treatment of I PF in more than 70 countries and for the treatment of SSc -ILD 
inEurope , US, Japan, Austra lia, Canada , China and several other countries . In addition,
nintedanib has been approved for the treatment of adults with chronic fibrosing interstitial 
lung diseases with a progressive phenot ype in the US , Canada, Japan and has received a 
positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_507281] . Nintedanib has show n a consistent benefit in slowing the rate of 
decline in lung function over 52 weeks across these indications [P14-[ZIP_CODE] , P19 - [ZIP_CODE], P19 -
[ZIP_CODE] ].
Based on its mode of action and demonstrated effect in various pre -clinical models of ILD
and demonstrated clinical benefit in various adult fibrosing ILDs (e.g. IPF, fibrosing ILDs 
with a progressive phenoty pe,and SSc-ILD) , treatment of fibrosing ILDs with nintedanib in 
children and adolescents is expected to lead to similar clinical benefit as observed in adults.
1.4.[ADDRESS_654598] frequently  reported adverse reactions associated with the use of 
nintedanib in adults relate to the gastrointestinal system (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain), decreased appetite and hepatic enzy me increase. These events are mostly  
non-serious and are reversible with dose reductions or drug discontinuation. L ess frequent 
and important adverse reactions include b leeding and drug induced liver injury  (DILI) which 
may result in fatal outcome.
Additional risk sspecific for the paediatric population based on the mechanism of action of 
nintedanib have also been identified in preclinical animal studies, like a potentia l impact in 
maturation and growth, in bone development and in tooth development (see Table 1.4.2:1 for 
details).
The most frequentl y reported adverse reactions associated with the use of nintedanib in 
adults, and the potential risks specific to the paediatric population, will be carefully  
monitored.
Based on the pharmacological mechanism, existing non -clinical, clinical and post- marketing 
data,there is no indication that treatment with nintedanib may  increase the risk for infection 
with SARS -CoV -2or the risk for worsening the disease course of COVID -19.However, 
patients with 
chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases may be at risk of severe clinical 
courses due to the underly ing disease, associated co -morbidities and potential use of 
immunosuppressive co -medications

safet y data at regular intervals, advise the stud y team about the appropriateness of fu rther 
enrolment and continuation/modification/premature interruption of the study ,and might 
recommend dose modification and/or additional assessments (e.g. intermediate checks in

1.4.3 Discussion
Given the high unmet need for treatment options in paediatric fibrosing ILDs, the established 
clinical benefit and known safety profile of nintedanib in adults as well as the expected 
benefit of nintedanib in the paediatric fibrosing ILD, the benefit -risk of nintedanib in the 
target population is considered acceptabl e. The planned trial procedures and the associated -
risk are deemed acceptable as they allow for timely  identification of potential risk s, 
discontinuation of treatment and possible revers alof adverse drug reactions.

variable duration, in children and adolescents (6 to 17 y ears old) with clinically  significant 
fibrosing interstitial lung disease.
All patients recruited for the study  will enter a 4
-week screening period (Visit 1 to Visit 2)
(see Flow Chart and footnotes for permitted time window) . At Visit 2 patients meeting in -
/exclusion criteria will be randomised and enter the treatment period of the study . This period 
will consist of two parts: Part A and Part B (Figure 3.1: 1).
Figure 3.1: 1 Trial design
FPE: First Patient Enrolled ; FPI: [INVESTIGATOR_507287] (i.e. randomized ); LPI: [INVESTIGATOR_507288]; EoT : End of Treatment .
During Part A patients will receive blinded randomised treatment (nintedanib or placebo 2:1) 
for 24 weeks. Following completion of Part A (Visit 6), patients will be switched to open 
label nintedanib (Part B) and will remain on treatment until the end of the study ,or premature 
discontinuation . The duration of treatment in Part B is “variable” from patient to patient, 
depending on when the patient has entered the treatment per iod of the study . For the 
definition of “the end of the study ” see Section 8.6 . 
The study  will include two database locks (DBL 1 and DBL 2). The first DBL will be 
announced once 30 patients (at least [ADDRESS_654614] 
10 children aged 6-11 years) have completed PK sampling at 26 weeks, or prematurel y 
discontinued the trial (last -patient -last-visit-primary -endpoint). At this timepoint patient 
recruitment will close. Based on the data from DBL 1 (or updated DBL 1 data once the 
number of patients with sufficient PK data has been reached
), the primary  analy sis and a 
benefit -risk assessment will be done and the clinical trial report for the primary  anal ysis will 
be written. The timing of final DBL (DBL 2) and EoT visit will be communicated after 
confirming adequacy  of PK data from DBL 1 ( or updated DBL 1 data )
.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654615]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018If no additional PK data are needed , all patients, including those who may  have entered the 
study  after targeted number (30 patients) have been randomised, will be scheduled for an EoT 
visit.
After the EoT visit, patients will enter a 4 -week follow -up period (see Flow Chart and 
footnotes for permitted time window) , unless they subsequently  roll-over into the open label 
extension trial. The open label extension trial (1199- 0378) will be initiated if supported b y 
the benefit -risk assessment from DBL 1.
In the rare case that additional PK data is deemed necessary  to complete the primary  PK 
assessment, data from DBL 1will be updated andthe administrative DBL 2 will be 
postponed. Additional PK will be collected b y switching ongoing study participants in Part A 
to Part B and/or recruiting new patients directly  to Part B following screening if supported by  
[CONTACT_213087] -risk assessment. This decision will be made after discussion with the Safet y 
Monitor ingCommittee (SMC) and properl y documented. Once the decision is taken, all 
patients who did not y et complete Visit 6 (and were not prematurel y discontinued) will be 
scheduled for Visit 6, complete all visit procedures (see Section 6.2.2 for details )and enter 
Part B . After two weeks of open label treatment each patient will attend Visit 7, and blood 
samples for PK anal yses will be collected per standard procedures ( seeFlow Chart for PK 
blood sampling for details). If the number of patients in Part A is not sufficient, further 
patients w ill be sc reened and entered to P art B at the end of the screening period, if meeting 
eligibility  criteria (see Section 3.3. 2and Section 3.3.3 for details).
Patients who prematurel y discontinued trial medication will be asked to remain in the study 
and return to all regularl y scheduled visits until the end of the trial. For details about 
procedures to be conducted at these visits please refer to Section 6.2.3 . For those patients who 
are unable to complete the scheduled visits, every  attempt will be made to get information on 
vital status at 24 weeks after randomization (i.e. the time of the data cut- off for the primary  
analysis), at 52 weeks and at the end of the trial. These requests will be outlined in the 
parental -information form and discussed during administration of the informed consent (the 
same applies to the assent form, where applicable).
For each patient, the study pe riod is from the signature [CONTACT_6671]  [CONTACT_31588](s)/legal guardian until the patient’s last visit of the study . Adverse events will be 
collected during the entire study  period and considered treatment

drug intake u ntil 28 day s after drug discontinuation.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
Placebo design and treatment allocation
A placebo -control leddesign is considered necessary  for evaluating and interpreting the AE 
reporting.
While the safety  profile is presumed to be similar to that observed in the adult studies 
including IPF, SSc -ILD and fibrosing ILDs with progressive phenot ype, the availability  of a

paediatric population .
In addition, though limited, use of a placebo group may  allow for exploratory  evaluation of 
the natural course of lung function and assess comparability  of the study  population to 
historical controls if available by  [CONTACT_221774].
To minimise the potential negative impact of a placebo
-control design on recruitment and 
taking into account the disease severit y, use of standard of care as deemed clinically  indicated 
by [CONTACT_507351]. In addition, as ther e are limited treatment option s
for the target population, after 24 weeks of double blind, placebo- controlled treatment all 
patients will be switched to open label nintedanib treatment. 
Consistent with the primary  objective of evaluating the safet y of ni ntedanib in the target 
population, a 2:[ADDRESS_654617] frequent AEs associated with nintedanib treatment in adults (e.g. increases in liver 
transaminase levels and/or bilirubin, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting) can be adequatel y assessed 
with a treatment duration of [ADDRESS_654618] that 6 -month observation is 
adequate to evaluate potential acute effects on growth [ R18-1476, R18-1477 ].
Moreover, the over all exposure to active treatment based on the proposed study  design allows 
for collection of long term safet y monitoring data of potential paediatric specific AEs (i.e. 
bone and teeth effects), which may  take longer to develop. Based on to the current design, 
assuming a recruitment time of 18 months, the treatment period for the minimum targeted 30 
subjects is expected to be minimum 26 weeks , with an average nintedanib exposure of

adolescents aged 12-17 years) with documented clinically  significant fibrosing interstitial 
lung disease will be randomised.
Patients under the age of 6 y ears will be excluded from the current study . This is based on the 
potential higher risk of nintedanib administration in children y ounger than 6 y ears, limited 
evidence to support the scientific rationale of potential benefit of nintedanib, and challenges 
in evaluating 
potential clinic al benefit as established in adults, in this paediatric subset.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have an informed consent signed b y the 
parent(s)/legal guardian) will be maintained in the Investigator Site File ( ISF)at the 
investig ational site irrespective of whether patients have been treated with investigational 
drug or not. 
Re-enrolment of screen failed patients will be permitted. Patients who did not qualify  for 
randomisation during the earl y months of the recruitment period m ight qualify  for 
randomisation during the late months of the recruitment period of the study. A previous 
‘screening failure’ patient will sign a new informed consent and get a new unique patient

The investigational medicinal products are ninted anib soft capsules 150 mg, 100 mg , 25 mg, 
and matching placebo capsules .
Nintedanib soft capsules 100 mg (oblong shape, 6.2 mm diameter and 16.3 mm length) and 
150 mg (oblong shape, 7.1 mm diameter and 17.6 mm length) are commercially  available for 
adults. Nintedanib soft capsules 25 mg of smaller size (oval shape, 5.1 mm diameter and 8.0 
mm length) have been developed for this trial in the paediatric population. The 75 mg and 50 
mg doses will be provided as multiples o f the newly  developed 25 mg dosage strength.
The sizes of the commercially  available 100 mg and 150 mg capsules are considered suitable 
for the targeted age -range. However, for patients who are unable to swallow the 
commerciall y available form, a multiple of the 25 mg capsule is proposed as an alternative 
administration strategy  for the 100 mg or 150 mg:
 4 x 25 mg for the 100 mg
 6 x 25 mg for the 150 mg

In order to match the s ystemic exposure reached in adult I PF patients, the nintedanib doses in 
paediatric patients were predicted based on bod y weight dependent allometric scaling 
(scaling of adult clearance using an exponent of 0.75, consistent with the e xponent estimated 
in population pharmacokinetics [ PopPK ]analy ses in adults; refer to the current version of the 
Investigator's Brochure Nintedanib in I diopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis, Sy stemic Sclerosis and 
Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial L ung Disease [ c01783972 -16] for details). This approach is 
considered acceptable, assuming a minor role of devel opmental changes referring to 
nintedanib PK for the selected target population. A population mean nintedanib exposure of 
80% to 125% compared to adult I PF patients treated with 150 mg b.i.d. was targeted for the 
determination of the planned doses b y bod y wei ght bin in the paediatric population as 
provided in Table 4.1.2: 1 .
The patient’s weight will be measured at screening, at randomization and at each IMP 
dispensing visit thereafter (see FlowChartfordetails) . At randomization the dose assigned 
will be based on the patient’s weight at baseline ( Visit 2). At subsequent visits the dose will 
be adjusted for any changes of the patient’s weight resulting in a change of the bod y weigh 
bin. I RT will assign t he proper dose based on the patient’s weight recorded at the respective 
visit.

Treatment should be interrupted in case the patient experiences a weight decrease below 13.5 
kg. Treatment can be resumed when patient’s weight reaches the threshold of 13.5 kg .
If a patient experiences a drug related adverse eve nt, the dose can be reduced to the next 
lower dose and the dose can be re -started after recovery . The dose reduction scheme in Table 
4.1.2: 1 should be considered to manage adverse events.
The dose can be reduced without prior interruption, i.e. immediately  steppi[INVESTIGATOR_507290].
If the reduced dose is well tolerated, re -escalation is possible within 4 weeks after dose 
reduction in case of AEs considered drug related, or within 8 weeks in case of AEs not 
considered drug related. If this occurs between scheduled visits, this will also require an 
unscheduled visit.
Dose reduction and re -increase are allowed at multiple occasions .
No further dose reduction outside of those listed will be allowed. In c ase of persistent adverse 
events observed at the reduced dose, or severe effects at the starting dose, permanent 
treatment discontinuation should be considered.
Temporary  treatment interruption is allowed to manage adverse events
(see below for 
details).
In case of pathological findings identified on follow- up bone imaging, or stunted growth 
identified on follow-up dental imaging, treatment should be interrupted, the patient case 
presented to the SMC by  [CONTACT_507356]. 
Treatment may  be resumed upon recommendation of the SMC .
The criteria to be followed for treatment interruption ,re-start and re -escalation are shown in 
Table 4.1.2: 2 .

treated accordingl y (e.g. viral infections, bacterial overgrowth, and antibiotic treatment).
Diarrhoea should be managed as earl y as possible after onset of first s ymptoms with standard 
antidiarrhea l symptomatic treatment, e.g. loperamide.
If diarrhoea persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_21601], treatment interruption and/or 
dose reduction of nintedanib should be considered. Table 4.1.2: 3 shows the 
recommendations for children and adolescents with the appropriate age and weight -adjusted 
dosing.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654659]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018Initial assessment of liver enzy me elevation should be performed at the investigational site. 
Blood samples for additional monitoring may  be collected at the investigational site, primary

laboratory  for anal ysis.
Management of acute ILD exacerbations
In case of acute ILD exacerbations or clinical deterioration , all treatment options considered 
adequate b y the Investigator are allowed. The patient may interrupt study treatment for up to 
8 weeks, if necessary  (e.g. if short -term full anticoagulation is performed).
4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After the assessment of all in- and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be randomised 
to treatment groups according to a randomisation plan in a 2:1ratio (nintedanib:placebo) at 
Visit 2 (i.e.at start of Part A) via Interactive Response Technology  (IRT)stratified by[CONTACT_135911] (6 -<12 years; 12 -<18 years). Access to the codes will be controlled and 
documented. A validated randomisation software will be used to generate the randomisation. 
Technical and statistical features of the process of treatment allocation are described in 
Section 7.4 .
After completion of 24 weeks of blinded treatment , at Visit 6 (i.e. at start of Part B) each 
patient will be assigned via IRT to open label treatment with nintedanib , until EoT or 
premature discontinuation.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
For the individual patient the start of treatment period is planned on the day of randomization
atVisit 2 ,and the end of treatment period is planned at the EoT visit; the last dose of trial 
medication should be taken in the evening before the EoT visit.
During the treatment period the treatment for an individual patient will be assigned b y means 
of an IRT contact [CONTACT_507357] .
The investigational product should only  be dispensed to parents/caregiver(s) (or patients if 
applicable based on their maturity ) if the patient was entered to the treatment phase of the 
study , during clinic visits as defined b y protocol and by  [CONTACT_113640] p ersonnel as documented 
in the “Trial Staff List”.
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances (e.g. pandemic, please see 
Section 6 .1), physical patient visits to the sites may  not be feasible or may  need to be 
restricted to ensure patient safet y. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, 
the investigator may  still decide to continue trial treatment. Where permitted by  [CONTACT_507358], trial medication may  be shipped directly to the patients’ home. If the defined 
minimum frequency  of trial procedures cannot be adhered to, discontinuation from trial 
medication should be considered. See Appendix 10.9 for details.

bigger capsules .
The patient should take the capsules twice dail y, at about the same time every  day (between 
06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening ), with a dose interval of 
approximately  12 hours from one dose to the next dose .
The patient should s wallow the whole capsule swith water (a glass, approximately  250 mL )
and should 
not chew or crush the capsules. If contact [CONTACT_507359], 
hands should be washed immediately and thoroughly . As nintedanib may  cause stomach 
discomfort, the patient is recommended totake the capsules with food, i.e. during or 
immediately  before or after a meal .
In case a dose is 
forgotten, the dose should be skipped if the time window to the ne xt dose is 
less than 8 hours. The following dose should be taken according to the protocol. No catch up 
of missed doses is permitted.
In case of adverse events requiring a dose reduction between planned visits (see Section 4.1.2
for details) , the patient will attend an unscheduled visit. T he investigator will visit the patient, 
record the reason for dose change, assign the new dose and instruct the patient and 
parent(s)/ legal guardian on the number of capsules to be taken in the morning and in the 
evening until the next visit. Drug accountabilit y will be completed carefully. Please refer to 
Section 6.2.2 for instructions.

results of their measurements until DBL  1.
At DBL 1 the trial will be unblinded by  [CONTACT_456]. 
In order to enable earl y analysis of PK, selected non-trialpersonnel from the sponsor 
involved in the PK analyses will be unblinded. The planned preliminary  analy ses will be 
conducte d on a continuous basis and will focus purely  on PK (no efficacy  or safet y outcomes 
will be anal ysed at that time). Available PK dat a will be provided to the SMC for 
consideration when evaluating the safet y of the trial . Measures will be taken to ensure the 
integrit y of the ongoing trial at the time of PK unblinding until the time of DBL 1. No 
i
ndividual unblinding information will be shared, however it could be communicated to the 
trial team how man y patients with evaluable PK data are missing to reach the target. The 
process for unblinding as well as the trial team functions to be unblinded will be defined in 
the preliminary  PK anal ysis logistics plan. I n addition, a dedicated database snapshot (no 
partial DBL) will be generated after ‘last -patient -last-visit-primary -endpoint’ (L PLVPE) prior 
to DBL 1 to allow for development and refinement of exposure -response models (“Fast -
track” PK/PD analy sis) referring to FVC and the most relevant safety  variables (e.g. 
diarrh oea and liver enzyme elevations). Onl y personnel involved in the exposure -response 
analyses will be granted access to the unblinded data before DBL 1, whereas the trial tea m 
and all other functions not involved in the exposure response anal yses will remain blinded.  
The anal ysis plan for the exposure -response anal ysis as well as the Trial Statistical Analy sis 
Plan ( TSAP )will be finalized and signed prior to the database sna
pshot for ‘fast -track PK/PD 
analyses’. No formal interim report will be generated. 
The SMC will review unblinded data. The independent statistician of the SMC will receive 
the randomization code to allow the required analyses on unblinded data. The indep endent 
statistician will ensure that all unblinded information remains within the SMC.
Patients, investigators and any  other site personnel will remain blinded with regard to the 
randomised treatment assignments until after the final database lock (DBL 2) .
For rules of breaking the code for an individual or for all patients in emergency  situations see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT . In case the automated 
unblinding option via the I RT s ystem is malfunctioning, the IRT service provider can be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (24 hours a day coverage) and the treatment allocation can be obtained. I RT 
support has direct access to the database and the treatment information can be manuall y 
obtained in case the automated process is not working properl y. Details about this process 
will be included in the I SF.
Emergency  unblinding must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identity  of the 
trialdrug must be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment 
or otherwise assure safety  of trialparticipants. The reason for unblinding must be 
documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page.

Oxygen saturation (SpO 2) will be measured after minimum [ADDRESS_654680] .
SpO 2with exertion will be measured during the 6MWT . See Section 5.1.6 for details.
A pulsoximeter and sensors suitable for the paediatric population should be used. F orehead
probe is recommended; if not available, earlobe andfinger probe are also allowed; once 
chosen, the probe should be used consistently  in the same patient .
Measurements will be recorded in source documents and transcribe d intothe CRF by 
[CONTACT_16795].
5.1.[ADDRESS_654681] acute ILD exacerbation or death
Consistent with recent publication, acute exacerbation will be defined as significant 
worsening of the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_507300] a change in regular 
management , based on more than 2 of the following criteria over 4 weeks [ R19-0805]:
Increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] ≥20% from baseline
Increase in or development of dy spnoea
Newl y developi[INVESTIGATOR_507301]
Onset/increase of ox ygen demand to attain the individual baseline saturation (at rest 
and/or during exercise)
Need for an additional level of ventilatory  support (in addition to oxy gen)
Decrease in spi[INVESTIGATOR_507302] ( ≥10%) from baseline for 
vital capacit y
Reduced exercise tolerance in children able to perform the tests (includes 
desaturation) .
Events that are clinically  considered to me et the definition of acute exacerbation but fail to 
meet the required criteria due to missing imaging data should be termed “suspected acute 
exacerbations” .
For the endpoints evaluating the effect of nintedanib on these events, AEs reported b y the 
Investigator will be used; the AEs will not be adjudicated.

Time to death (all-cause mortality ) will be based either on the date of death on the AE report 
for patients with AEs leading to death , or will be based on the information from the vi tal 
status assessment.
Analy sis of time to death due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_507303] b y the Adjudication Committee (AC) .
5.1.[ADDRESS_654683] (6MWT).
The 6MWT is a self- paced test of walking capacity . Patients are asked to walk as far as 
possible in [ADDRESS_654684] reliabilit y; however, there is strong evidence of a 
learning effect. At visits when the 6MWT is requested (see Flow Chart for details) the 
6MWT will be conduc ted only  once (not in duplicate). Training of site staff and patients 
before start of test at baseline (Visit 2) is important. Training materials and instructions will 
be provided in the ISF.
At visits when the 6MWT is requested the 6MWT should be preferabl y performed 
approximately  atthe same time of day  to minimize intraday  variability .
Please refer to 
Section 6.2.2 for preferred order of completion of assessments during a clinic visit .
Prior to and at the end of the 6MWT, patients will be asked to rate their breathing discomfort 
and overall fatigue using the Borg CR-10 Scale®(see A ppendix 10.6).During the test 
continuous pulse oximetry (SpO 2) will be performed.
The distance covered in 6 minutes , possible premature discontinuations and oxy gen use , 
oxygen saturation measured b y SpO 2, vital signs and sy mptoms of the patient will be 
recorded in the eCRF .

ASSESSMENT OFSAFETY
The primary  and secondary  endpoints of safety will be based on data at timepoints defined in 
Section 2.1.2 and Section 2.1.3. The 52 weeks time point will not be available for all patients, 
depending on the time of enrolment into the s tudy.

growth velocity  over time.
At each time point, height ,sittin g height will be assessed three times, and the average of the 3 
measurements will be taken . Height and sitting height will be assessed using a stadiometer. 
The stadiometer should be calibrated at regular intervals ( see ISF for further instructions )
. 
The si tting height should be standardized and calibrated.
Leg length will be assessed by  [CONTACT_507362][INVESTIGATOR_507304]. This willbe measured three times on each leg, and the average of the 3 
measurements will be taken.
These measurements will be recorded in the source documents available at the site and the

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
results in death,
is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe,
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574] ,
results in persistent or signif icant d isability  or incapacity ,
is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88796]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described above.
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in [IP_ADDRESS], subsections “AE Collection ”and“AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines” .
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_654700] (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s

hepatic injury
pathological findings identified on bone imaging
stunted growth identified on dental imaging
Hepatic injury
In this trial protocol, signs of hepatic injury  are defined as:
ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_654702]
ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_654703] and total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_654704]* 
ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_654705] and unexplained INR > 1.5*
ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_654706] and unexplained eosinophilia (>5%)*
ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_654707] and appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper abdominal quadrant pain or tenderness, fever and/or rash
*in the same blood draw sample.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patient s showing these lab 
abnormali ties need to immediately  stop the trial medication and be followed up according to 
the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC sy stem .The investigator is asked to collect 
requested information within 48 hours upon laboratory hepatic injury  alert/notificatio n.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated .
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causin g inability  to work or to perform usual activities.
The intensity  (severit y) of diarrhoea adverse events should be classified and recorded in the

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_654709] that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or conc omitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) .
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmaco logical properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half- lives).

From signing the informed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial: 
all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but should 
only report an y occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial 
treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_507367], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI 
SAE form (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2), but not on the CRF.
Vital Status Data Collection
Patients who discontinue trial medication prematurely , whose parents/legal guardians agree 
to be contact[CONTACT_507368], should be followed up as described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS], withdrawal from trial treatment. From then on until the individual patient’s 
end of the trial the investigator must report all d eaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, and 
trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs the investigator becomes aware 
of.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_654712] report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately  (within 24 hours) t o the s ponsor’s 
unique entry point (country  specific reporting process will be provided in the I SF). The same 
timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the 
investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trial must

5.3 DRUG CONCENTRATION M EASUREMENTS AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS
5.3.1 Assessment of p harmacokinetic s
Pharmacokinetics will be one primary  endpoint of this study . For this reason extensive PK 
sampling is planned , which is considered appropriate for the targeted age range of ≥6 years.
In exceptional cases of paediatric patients aged <12 y ears a sparse sampling approach should 
be applied; for details refer to the Flow Chart for PK blood sampling .
PK plasma sampling will be conducted at Visit [ADDRESS_654714]- dose (see Flow Chart for PK blood sampling ).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654715]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018In rare circumstances PK sampling might need to be repeated (e.g. blood samples not taken at 
required timepoint, wrong medication taken in the day s before PK sampling or on the day  of 
PK sampling , destro yed/lost sample during shipment ). In such cases PK sampling will be 
repeated close before the end of treatment visit, to allow the maximum possible interval from 
theprevious PK sampling.
Based on thisPK sampling , the area under the plasma concentration- time curve at stead y 
state ( AUCτ,ss ) and further PK parameters (see Section 2.2.2 )will be calculated b y non -
compartmental analy ses. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be included in the clinical trial 
report. In addition, p opulation pharm acokinetics analy ses will be conducted to further 
character ize PK (see S ection 7.2 .6), which will be reported separatel y. 
5.3.2 Methods of sample collection
A detailed description of sample collection and handling is provided in the laboratory
manual . For quantification of drug plasma concentrations of nintedanib, venous blood will be 
collected using a pre -labelled potassium ethy lenediamine -tetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing 
blood drawing tube. 
5.3.3 Analytical determinations
Nintedanib (in form of its free base BIBF 1120 BS) plasma concentrations will be determined 
by a validated assay  based on liquid chromatography -tandem -mass spectrometry  (LC-MS /
MS). The procedures and specifications of the analytical method are available at the 
bioanaly tical site (Nuvisan GmbH & Co KG, Wegenerstraße 13, [ZIP_CODE] Neu- Ulm, German y).

5.6 OTHER ASSESSMENTS
5.6.1 Assessment of quality of life via PedsQL™
Health
-related qualit y of life will be assessed using the PedsQL™ questionnaire [ R19-0760].
The PedsQL™ questionnaires will be administered according to the PedsQL™ 
Administration GuidelinesSM(for questionnaires to be administered in the different age 
groups and the administration guidelines see Appendix 10.7).
The PedsQL™ should be completed in a quiet area/room before the respondents complete 
any other health data forms and before they see the investigator.
Parents, Children (8-12 year-old) and Teens ( >12 y ear-old) may  self-administer the 
PedsQL ™ targeted for th eir age group after introductory  instructions from the administrator.  
If the administrator determines that the child or teen is unable to self -administer the 
PedsQL (e.g., due to illness, fatigue, reading difficulties), the PedsQL should be read 
aloud to the child or teen.  For the Young Child ( <8 year-old), the PedsQL™ should be 
administered b y reading the instructions and each item to the young child word for word.
If during the trial a patient changes age group, then the questionnaire appropriate for that age 
group should be administered .

-03 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 80of 170
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654717]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018If a patient has difficult y understanding the age- appropriate PedsQL , the preceding age 
group version may  be administered to the patient (e.g., administering the Young Child (5 -7) 
Self-Report version with the three faces response choices to an 8 y ear-old).  However, i f a 
patient presents with severe cognitive impairments (as determined b y the administrator), the 
PedsQL may not be appropriate for that patient .  In such cases, only the Parent -Proxy  
Report should be administered to the patient ’s parent.
The parent and the patient must complete the questionnaires independently  of one another. 
Consulting with one another during the completion of the questionnaire should be 
discouraged.  The patient answering the questionnaire should be facing away from the parent.
The parent and the patient will be provided with a pen or pencil and a solid writing surface. If 
a table is not available, the participant should be provided with an item such as a clipboard.  
The administrator will remain nearb y should questions or concer ns arise.
If the patient or parent has a question about what an item means or how they  should answer 
it, the administrator should not interpret the question for them, just repeat the item to them 
verbatim, ask them to answer the item according to what they think the question means and
choose the response that comes closest to how they  feel. The patient and/or the parent has the 
option of not answering a question if they  truly do not understand the question.
When the parent/patient returns the PedsQL™, the administrator will look it over, check to 
see that all answers have been completed and verify  that no item has more than one response. 
If any responses are incomplete, illegible, or there are multiple responses for an item, the 
administrator will ask the parent or patient to indicate their response.
The responses will be transcribed into the CRF b y designated site -personnel.
For further instructions and details see Appendix 10.7.
5.6.3 Patient ’sacceptability of the investigational product based on the size and 
number of capsules
Acceptability  is defined as the overall abil ity and willingness of the patient to use the 
medicinal product as intended.
In this stud y acceptability of the investigational product based on the size and number of 
capsules will be assessed .
The assessment of acceptability  will be performed by  [CONTACT_507369]. If the patient is considered not old enough per investigator 
judgment, the parent/caregiver can assist with completion of the questionnaire (see A ppendix 
10.8for details).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654718]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018In between stud y visits, the parent/legal guardian will be asked to record any failed or missed 
intake of medication (e.g. the patient did not swallow the medication, or doses were missed, 
etc.) and provide this documentat ion to the investigator at the next study  visit. The 
parent/legal guardian will be instructed to inform the investigator immediately  if two or more 
consecutive doses of trial medication are missed or not taken correctl y.
Moreover, to collect the investiga tor / site staff impression about the patient’s acceptability  of 
the study  medication intake, the treatment acceptability  questionnaire for theinvestigator or 
investigational site staff will be completed b y the investigator / site staff (see Appendix 10.8
for details).
5.6.4 Assessment of D LCO
The d iffusi ngcapacit y of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) will be assessed at Visit 2 to
characterize the patient
.
Single -breath D LCOmeasurement will be carried out according to the ATS/ERS guideline on 
DLCOmeasurements [ R06-2002] using the site own equipment . Before beginning the test, the 
manoeuvres should be demonstrated and the subject carefull y instructed.
DLCOwill be measured at Visit 2 and corrected for haemoglobin (Hb) measured at Visit 1 (see 
Appendix 10.3 for details) .
DLCOvalues will also be adjusted for altitude andcarbox yhaemoglobin (COHb). For 
predicted normal values, different sites may  use different prediction formulas, based on the 
method used to measure D LCO. In an y case, the calculation method used must be in 
compliance with the ATS/ERS guideline on D LCOmeasurements [ R06-2002] and the 
prediction formula appropriate for that method. Raw data (gas mixture, equation used for 
prediction of normal, further adjustments made if so) must be traced.
The D LCOassessment should be perfo rmed after the FVC measurement.
5.6.5 Fan severity score
Physician reported Fan severit y score [R09-5337] atVisit 2 will be used to determine 
eligibility  of the patient. For instructions on how to assign the severity-of- illness score see 
Appendix 10.1.
The score used to determine eligibility  of the patient can be based on historical data . 
Documentation of measure ments used to determine the score at Visit 2 (e.g. ambulatory  
oxygen saturation or night time oximetry  reports) will need to be documented and made 
available for central review. Data from stud y visit procedures (e.g.ambulatory  oxygen 
saturation )can also be used.
Fan score as an outcome measure will be calculated by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor based on response to B org
CR-10 scale®and ox ygen saturation at rest and after [ADDRESS_654719]. This will be further 
defined in TSAP.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The trial consists of a screening period ( from informed consent to Visit 2), a treatment period 
divided into double blind Part A of 24 weeks ( from Visit 2 to Visit 6) and open label Part B
of variable duration ( from Visit 6 to EoT), and a follow -up period (from EoT to End of trial 
visit; this period is only  for those patients who are not enrolled into the separate open label 
extension study ).
If additional PK data are needed after DBL 1, patients meeting in-/exclusion criteria at Visit 2 
will be directly  enter edintoPart B , and patients undergoing double blind treatment will be 
directly  switched to Part B.
All study  visits should be scheduled according to the visit schedule defined in the Flow C hart. 
Windows of ± 3 day s for Visits 3 to 7, ±7 day s for the following v isitsare defined to 
accommodate scheduling problems.
All efforts should be made to perform all visits as requested .
If a delay  is observed for a particular visit, the original calendar schedule should be kept for 
subsequent visits (delay s should not accumulate).
In case of a missed visit the investigator should contact [CONTACT_456]; these situations will be 
addressed on a case b y case basis. Should a visit be postponed until the time window of the 
next visit, the visit will be skipped and the next vis it will be scheduled as defined b y Flow 
Chart, based on the actual date of Visit 2.
Timing of visits should also be properl y planned, takinginto account that:
The patient should take the trial medication twice daily , at about the same time every  
day (between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening), with a 
dose interval of approximately  12 hours from one dose to the next dose. The morning 
dose at Visit 2, Visit 3 , Visit 6 and Visit 7 should be taken at the site.
The pre -dose PK s ampling ( Visit 3 and Visit 7) should be conducted immediately  
before intake of the morning dose of trialmedication ; the post -dose PK sampling 
should be conducted 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h after the morning dose of trial medication.
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_139343] s hould alway s be conducted at approximately  the same 
time of the day , with reference to baseline measurement (Visit 2).
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic) the 
investigational plan as per this clinical trial prot ocol may  not be feasible at a site. With the 
consent 
ofthe patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian (and assent by  [CONTACT_507340] ), 
sponsor and investigator may implement risk mitigation measures and modifications to CTP 
standard procedures which may include ,but arenot limited to,direct -to-patient shipment of 
trial medication from the site , laboratory  tests done by  [CONTACT_507371]/local lab ( if possible 
samples collected and processed b y local physician/local lab using kits provided by  [CONTACT_507372]), bone and dental assessments (bone

trained healthcare provider ( e.g. nurse) that could be combined with remote patient visits (via 
telephone and/or internet based means of communication). R isk mitigation measures and
modifications to CTP standard procedures that can be implemented at a site are described in 
Appendix 10.9. Measures implemented at a site should be mentioned in the information 
leaflet for the patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian (and in the patient information where 
applicable) . The implementation of these measures will depend on consent from the patient’s 
parent(s)/legal guardian , operational feasibility , local law and regulations. If alternative 
procedures are implemented, the deviations from the standard trial procedures will be 
precisel y documented and the implications considered for the analy sis of the tri al data .If the 
defined minimum frequency of trial procedures cannot be adhered to, discontinuation from 
trial medication should be considered. See Appendix 10.[ADDRESS_654726] of the visit, taking into account 
the specific structure of the site and the mandatory  needs outlined in the clinical trial 
protocol. Efforts should be made to ensure the well -being of the patient during the visit.

SAMPLE SIZE
The main objective will be assessed by [CONTACT_507381] y endpoints 
and by  [CONTACT_507382]. ThePK, safet y and efficacy endpoints as well as other 
assessments as stated in Section 5 , will be compared between the treatment groups using 
descriptive statistics.
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
No confirmatory  testing is performed and hence no null and alternative hy potheses are 
defined. A justification of the sample size is provided in Section 7.5. 
Any confidence intervals computed are to be interpreted in the perspective of the exploratory 
character of the stud y; i.e., confidence intervals are considered as interval estimates for 
effects.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following anal ysis sets will be defined for this trial:
Treated Set (TS):
The Treated Set (TS) consists of patients who are randomised to a treatment group 
and receive at least one dose of study  medication .
PerProtocol Set (PPS):
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will consist of patients from TS considering exclusion 
from the set based on important protocol deviations .
Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analysis Set (PKS):
The Pharmacokinetic P arameter Analysis Set(PKS) includes all patients in the 
Treated Set (TS) who provide at least one PK endpoint that was not excluded due to a 
protocol deviation relevant to the evaluation of PK or due to PK non -evaluability  (as 
specified in the following subsection ‘Pharmacokin etics’). Thus, a patient will be 
included in the PKS, even if he/she contributes only  one PK parameter value for one 
period to the statistical assessment .
Descriptive and model based anal yses of PK parameters will be based on the PKS. All other 
analyses will be based on the TS. 
Pharmacokinetics:
The pharmacokinetic parameters listed in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 for nintedanib will be 
calculated using Phoenix WinNonlinTM software (version 6.3 or higher,  
) or SAS®Version 9.4 (or later version) b y means of noncompartmental 
analysis and according to the relevant SOP of the sponsor.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654755]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018Plasma concentration data and parameters of a subject will be included in the PK anal yses,if 
they are not flagged for exclusion due to a protocol deviation relevant to the evaluation of PK 
(to be decided no later than in the Blinded Report Planning Me eting) or due to PK non-
evaluability  (as revealed during data anal ysis, based on the criteria specified below). 
Exclusion of a subject’s data will be documented in the CTR.
Patients who are considered as not evaluable will be listed with their individual p lasma 
concentrations and individual pharmacokinetic parameters. However they  will not be 
included in descriptive statistics for plasma concentrations, pharmacokinetic parameters or 
other statistical assessment apart from safet y evaluation.
Plasma concentr ations will be plotted graphicall y versus time for all patients as listed in the
drug plasma concentration -time tables. Only  concentrations within the validated 
concentration range and actual sampling-times will be used for the calculation of 
pharmacokinet ic parameters. For the presentation of the mean profiles, the arithmetic mean 
and the planned blood sampling times will be used.
Handling and derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters will be done according to BI 
standards .
The following descriptive statistics will be calculated for analy te concentrations as well as for
all pharmacokinetic parameters: N, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, median,
maximum, arithmetic coefficient of variation, geometric mean and geometric coefficient of
varia tion. The data format for descriptive statistics of concentrations will be identical with the
data format of the respective concentrations (i.e. three significant digits). The descriptive
statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using th e individual values with
the number of decimal places as provided b y the evaluation program. Then the individual
values as well as the descriptive statistics will be reported with three significant digits in the
clinical trial report.
Adherence to the pro tocol will be assessed by  [CONTACT_476974]. Important protocol deviation
(IPD) categories will be suggested in the integrated Quality  and Risk Management Plan 
(IQRM P). IPDs will be identified no later than in the Report Planning Meeting, and the IPD 
categori es will be updated as needed.
Allanaly ses will be based on the actual treatment group. Details will be specified in the 
TSAP.
Patients without any  post -randomization data will be handled as missing for the respective 
endpoints and assessments (see Section 7.3).
Handling of anticipated problems (e.g. planned data transformations based on the expected 
distributional characteristics or convergence of the mixed models) will be addressed in the 
TSAP.

state (AUCτ,ss) will be calculated b y non -compartmental as well as compartmental analy sis
and descriptive statistics will be provided as detailed in Section 7.2.1.
For patients receiving nintedanib in Part A, PK profiles on week 2 and week 26 are planned

week 2 value is missing, then it will be replaced by [CONTACT_507383]τ,ss at week 26. For 
patients receiving placebo in Part A and nintedanib in Part B, AUCτ,ss evaluated based on 
PK profiles at week 26 will be used (which corr esponds to week 2 on active treatment).
Further details on the PK anal ysis will be specified in the TSAP.
The primary  safet y endpoint listed in Section 2.1.2 will be derived according to BI standards. 
For the primary  anal ysis, only  treatment emergent AEs during the double- blind period until 
week 24 will be included. The anal ysis will be based on the TS and will be descriptive in 
nature.
Subgroup anal yses will be specified in the TSAP .
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
Analy sis of secondary  endpoints listed in Section 2.1.3 will be descriptive in nature using a 
mixed model with repeated measurements (MMRM) for continuous endpoints . Time -to-event 
endpoints will be displayed descriptivel y using the Kaplan- Meier method. Categorical 
endpoints, safet y and tolerability will be displayed descriptivel y in frequency tables. Further 
details will be provided in the TSAP.
7.2.5 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events 
with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of [ADDRESS_654757] drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will 
also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’.

Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) at database lock .
Laboratory  data will be analy sedboth quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summarised . Treatment 
groups wil l be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as well as with 
regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically  relevant

"missing at random assumption".
In the anal ysis of time -to-event endpoints, missing or incomplete data will be handled using
standard survival anal ysis techniques (i.e. censoring).
In the anal yses of the binary  endpoints, m ultiple imputation will be used to handle missing 
data at week 24. For week 52 and later, data will not be imputed and only  observed values 
will be used. 
For pharmacokinetics:
Handl ing of missing PK data will be performed according to BI standards. For the non -
compartmental analy sis, concentration data identified with NOS (no sample), NOR (no valid 
result), NOA (not anal ysed) will generally  not be considered. Concentration values in the lag 
phase identified as BLQ or NOP will be set to zero. All other BLQ (below the limit of 
quantification), and NOP (no peak detectable) values of the profile will be ignored. The lag 
phase is defined as the period between time zero and the first time p oint with a concentration 
above the quantification limit.
7.4 RANDOMISATION
Patients will be randomised to each treatment group with an approximate ratio of 2:1
(nintedanib:placebo) stratified by[CONTACT_551] (6 -<12 y ears; 12 - <18 years). BI will arrange 
for the randomisation and the packaging and labelling of trialmedication. The randomisation 
list will be generated using a validated s ystem, which involves a pseudo-random number 
generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -predi ctable. The 
block size will be documented in the CTR . Access to the codes wil l be controlled and

Although the duration of the blinded treatment period (Part A) will be var iable in some of 
these patients, all PK and clinical data collected will be used in the primary  anal ysis to allow 
for more robust estimate of exposure and potential treatment effect.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654834]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018PedsQL™ Administration GuidelinesSM
The following guidelines are intended for use b y individuals trained in the administration of 
standardized questionnaires.  The PedsQL™ administrator is crucial in developi[INVESTIGATOR_507333], emphasizing the importance of the qu estionnaire, addressing concerns, 
and ensuring that the PedsQL ™ is completed accuratel y and confidentially.  
General Protocol
1. Create a procedure for assigning identification numbers that will allow for parent/child 
comparisons as well as comparisons of baseline/follow -up data.
2.If feasible, the PedsQL™ should be completed before the respondents complete an y other 
health data forms and before they see their phy sician or healthcare provider.
3.The parent/child should first complete the PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales and then 
complete an y additional PedsQL™ Module.
4.Parents, Children (8- 12) and Teens (13 -18) may  self-administer the PedsQL™ after 
introductory  instructions from the administrator.  If the administrator determines that the 
child or teen is unable to self -administer the PedsQL (e.g., due to illness, fatigue, 
reading difficulties), the PedsQL should be read aloud to the child or teen.  For the 
Young Child (5- 7), the PedsQL™ should be administered by  [CONTACT_507393].  At the beginning of each subscale repeat the 
recall interval instructions (one month or 7 day s) to remind the y oung child to respond 
only for that specific recall interval.  Use the separate page with the three faces response 
choices to help the young child understand how to answer.  When reading items aloud to 
a child, intonation should be kept neutral to avoid suggesting an answer.
5.If a child has difficulty  understanding the age -appropriate PedsQL , the preceding age 
group version ma y be administered to the child (e.g., administering the Young Child (5 -7) 
Self-Report version with the three faces response choices to an 8 y ear old).  However, if a 
child presents with severe cognitive impairments (as determined b y the administrator), the
PedsQL may not be appropriate for that child.  In such cases, onl y the Parent -Proxy  
Report should be administered to the child’s parent.
6.The parent and child must complete the questionnaires independently of one another. 
Discourage the parent, child, or other family  members from consulting with one another 
during the completion of the questionnaire.  Let them know that they  can feel free to 
discuss their answers following completion of the questionnaires, but that it is important 
to get both the parent’s and the child’s individual perspectives.  If you are administering 
the questionnaire to the child, the child should be facing away  from the parent.
7.If the child or parent has a question about what an item means or how they  should answer 
it, do not interpret the question for them.  Repeat the item to them verbatim.  Ask them to 
answer the item according to what they think the question means .  If they  have trouble 
deciding on an answer, ask them to choose the response that comes closest to how they  
feel. The child and/or the parent has the option of not answering a question if they  truly 
do not understand the question. 
8.If a parent/child asks you to inte rpret the responses, tell her/him that y ou are not trained to 
interpret or provide a score for the answers given.  If the PedsQL™ is being used for a

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_654835]-03(16.0) /Saved on:31Aug 2018clinical study , let the parent/child know that their answers will be combined with other 
participants’ ans wers and anal ysed as a group rather than as individual respondents.
9.   Document all reasons for refusals and non -completions of the PedsQL™.
Administering the PedsQL™
1.The following scripts have been developed as a guide to introduce the PedsQL ™ to the 
child and his/her parent(s).  Modify  the language to a sty le that is most appropriate for 
you and the respondent.
For the child:
The PedsQL™ asks you questions about how you feel and what you think about your 
health.  It is not a test, and there are no right or wrong answers.  It takes about [ADDRESS_654836] any questions, please let me know.
For the parent:
The PedsQL™ is a questionnaire that assesses health- related quality of life in 
children and adolescents.  It contains question s about your child’s physical, 
emotional, social, and school functioning in the past one month ( or for the Acute 
version, in the past 7 days) .  
The PedsQL™ is brief and typi[INVESTIGATOR_262539] [ADDRESS_654837] to how you truly feel.  Please do 
not compare your answers with your child's responses.  We are interested in your and 
your child’s indiv idual perspectives.  However, feel free to discuss the questionnaire 
with your child after you have both completed it and returned it to me.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know.
2. Provide the respondent with a pen or pencil and a solid writing su rface.  If a table is not 
available, the participant should be provided with an item such as a clipboard.  Remain 
nearb y should questions or concerns arise.
3. When the parent/child returns the PedsQL™, look it over and check to see that all 
answers have been completed.  Verify  that no item has more than one response.  If any  
responses are incomplete, illegible, or there are multiple responses for an item, please ask 
the parent or child to indicate their response.  
4.Ask the participants if they  had any  difficu lties completing the questionnaire or if they  
have an y other comments regarding the questionnaire.  Document an y important 
feedback.
5.Thank the parent and child for taking the time to complete the questionnaire.  If the study  
design involves following up with these respondents, let them know that they  may  be 
asked to complete the PedsQL ™ again at another time.  I ndicate when they can expect to 
be contact[CONTACT_507394].

Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analysis Set (PKS):
The Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analysis Set
(PKS) includes all patients subjects in the Treated 
Set (TS) who provide at least one PK endpoint 
that was not excluded due to a protocol 
deviation relevant to the evaluation of PK or 
due to PK non -evaluability (as specified in the 
following subsection ‘Pharmacokinetics’). 
Thus, a patient will be included in the PKS,

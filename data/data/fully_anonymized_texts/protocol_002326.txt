dressing methods in morbidly obese parturients    
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_44160]  
1. Objectives  
Purpose,  specific aims, and hypothesis:  
Purpose: We propose this study to prospect ively evaluate the efficacy of the three types of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44161], in terms of catheter 
migration,  taking into consideration the influence of body mass index on this variable .                                             
Primary aim: We will evaluate the efficacy of three different epi[INVESTIGATOR_44162] .                                                                                                                       
Secondary aims: To compare the effect of different degrees of obesity measured by [CONTACT_44207], on 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44163]. To evaluate the 
effect of time an indwelling catheter remains in place, level of insertion and patient’s height on 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44164].                                                                                                                    
Hypothesis: The use of dressing with transparent TegadermTM plus SorbaView SHIELD® dressing 
is superior to the dressing with TegadermTM plus Steri -StripTM bands in addition to a catheter 
support pad, and to a dressing with TegadermTM only, for epi[INVESTIGATOR_44165], in terms of catheter migration. epi[INVESTIGATOR_44166] .

 2. Background  
Background and rationale for  the study:  
Failure of labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_44167] a well -recognized situation in obstetric anesthesia practice. Incidence of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44168] 12% in a retrospective analysis of 19.259 deliveries (1). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_44169] e obstetric and non -obstetric settings (2,3). It has been argued that 
prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44170] a potential remedy to at least part of the incomplete or failed 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44171] (4,5). Motamed et al showed that 45% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44172] i n major abdominal 
surgery could be attributable to catheter migration (6). Phillips et al studied epi[INVESTIGATOR_44173] 54% (7). Migration was [ADDRESS_46359] direction (8).  
 
Factors influencing catheter migration include weight, body mass index, depth of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_44174] (9,10). Bishton et al documented inward migration in 13% and outward displacement of 
one or more centimeters in 22% of patients in a cohort of 153 laboring patients (10). They also found that 
all cases of failed epi[INVESTIGATOR_44175] 2,5 cm (10). Hamilton 
et al showed an a ssociation between patient position change and movement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44176], when the 
patient is sitting with a straight back and when placed on lateral decubitus position (11). The authors found 
that the magnitude of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44177] >30 kg/m2. 
It has been hypothesized that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_44178], as the maximum pressure found during catheter placement corresponds to this anatomical 
structure (1 2). When the patient changes position after tapi[INVESTIGATOR_44179], especially in the case of a 
parturient with high BMI, the new anchor point theoretically moves to the skin, facilitating outward 
migration of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810] (9).  
 
Some authors have eva luated the influence of different dressing methods on epi[INVESTIGATOR_44164]. 
Burns et al compared TegadermTM dressing, TegadermTM plus filter -shoulder fixation and Niko Epi -Fix 
dressing in 113 patients in labor (2), finding that TegadermTM plus filte r-shoulder was superior in terms of 
minimization of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44159]. Their study doesn’t mention weight or BMI of patients 
included in the study. Odor et al evaluated the efficacy of Epi -FixTM, Lockit Plus® and TegadermTM for 
dressing of int rapartum catheters, finding superiority of the Lockit Plus® system to decrease catheter 
migration and epi[INVESTIGATOR_44180] (13). The authors didn’t evaluate the effect of BMI on the outcomes 
and even excluded patients with BMI >50 kg/m2. Similar resu lts were reported by [CONTACT_44208] a cohort of 
102 patients having epi[INVESTIGATOR_44181] -obstetric procedures (14).  
 
The obstetric population treated at the Labor and Delivery Unit at Augusta University Medical Center is 
characterized by a high  incidence of obesity and morbid obesity. This situation makes insertion and 
management of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44182]. Although the influence of BMI 
on catheter migration has been suggested; to our knowledge, no study to da te has evaluated epi[INVESTIGATOR_44183] a high BMI obstetric population. Evaluating these type of association is clinically 
relevant as epi[INVESTIGATOR_44184] a situation that might potentially compromise patient safety. It may increase 
the rate of ep idural replacement with the concomitant technical difficulties and the potential need to use 
general anesthesia in cases of unplanned cesarean section in a patient with an indwelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. 
This latter situation is particularly hazardous, knowi ng the increased incidence of difficult airway in both 
obstetric and obese patients (15). We propose this study to compare the effect of three different epi[INVESTIGATOR_44185] >30 kg/m2 on epi[INVESTIGATOR_44186].

5.2.1  Study Subjects and Approximate Number of Subjects This is a multi -
center study which will include the participation of approximately 162 
subjects (81 subjects per study arm).  ................................ ........................... [ADDRESS_1235424] to treat diabetes has risen to $245 
billion of which antidiabetic medications including insulin account s for 12% of the total costs.[ 1] 
People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of approximately $13,[ADDRESS_1235425] burden carried by [CONTACT_883008] .[1] As the population 
ages and as disease progresses, the amount of medications prescribed will increase which can 
further escalate the financial burden to both the subject  and health care system.   
 
With the progression of diabetes, insulin therapy is warranted for most subject s and many require 
both fasting and prandial insulin due to inadequate insulin secretion and insulin resistance in type 
2 diabetes.  Different types of insulin are available with n ew analogue insulins typi[INVESTIGATOR_883004] (RHI) due to improved insulin profiles and a more predictable glucose 
response when given via subcutaneous injection . [2] Ninety -six percent (96%) of subject s with 
type 2 diabetes who take insulin in the Un ited States use analog insulin(s). This is an increase 
from 19% in the year 2000.  [3,4]  In subject s prescribed basal -bolus or bolus -only therapy,  rapid 
acting insulin (RAI) analogs have surpassed usage of RHI.  However, the steep increase in the 
cost of RAI has led to rationing of insulin or the total discontinuance of therap y by [CONTACT_883009] s due to cost.  [5] The lack of affordability of RAI has forced the clinical and economic 
benefits of RAI to be reconsidered in clinical practice and in literature. Fo r many subject s, RHI 
provides a more affordable option for insulin therapy when compared to RAIs, especially if the 
limitations of the insulin profile can be overcome by [CONTACT_883010] (CSII) using a wearabl e insulin delivery device.   
 
V-Go (Valeritas, Inc. Bridgewater, NJ) is worn like a patch, and insulin is initiated when the 
subject  presses a button to insert a small needle subcutaneously.  Once the needle is inserted, a 
continuous basal rate of insulin is delivered for 24 hours, and on -demand bolus dosing of insulin 
can be administered in 2 -unit increments to meet prandial (mealtime ) insulin needs by [CONTACT_883011]. [6]  Tubing, programming, or batteries are not required with V -Go, unlike other CSII 
devices.  V-Go is cleared by [CONTACT_883012] a U-[ADDRESS_1235426] -acting insulin (e.g. insulin lispro, 
insulin aspart)  and has been pro ven to improve clinical outcomes with less insulin .    
 
Research has demonstrated as the cost of treatment increases the  patient adherence decreases, 
which  can be associated with poor health outcomes .[7,8,9]  Based on the rising costs for insulin 
analogs, investigating the prospective use of RHI delivered with V -Go could be a viable option 
[ADDRESS_1235427] s and insurance plans . 
 
2 ETHICS  
 
2.1 Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), in accordance 
with the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). The study will 
be conducted in compliance w ith the protocol.  
All potential protocol deviations or violations must be reported to the IRB immediately. A 
protocol deviation or violation is defined as a violation of the GCP guidelines regarding the 
study protocol, which is likely to significantly aff ect the safety of the subjects in the study or the 
scientific validity of the study. Study staff involved in conducting this study will be qualified by 
[CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to perform their respective tasks and this study will not use 
study staff where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, 
debarment).  
2.[ADDRESS_1235428] (IRB)  
Before initiation of the study, the investigator must have received IRB approval for the protocol, 
ICF, subject recruitment materials (eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be 
provided to subjects.   
During the clinical study, any amend ment to the clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the 
IRB before implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to 
the subjects, in which case the IRB should be informed as soon as possible. The IRB should also 
be in formed of any event likely to change the safety of subjects in the clinical trial. The 
investigator must send a progress report to the IRB at least annually, as well as a summary of the 
clinical trial’s outcome at the end of the clinical trial.  
2.[ADDRESS_1235429]’s participation in the clinical trial, the written ICF should be sig ned and dated 
personally by [CONTACT_30360]’s legally acceptable representative, and by [CONTACT_67636]. A copy of the signed and dated written ICF will 
be provided to the subject.  
 
[ADDRESS_1235430] s administering RAI with V -Go can be safely switched to U-100 RHI delivery with V -Go 
and maintain similar glycemic control measured by [CONTACT_252750] (A1C).    
 
[ADDRESS_1235431] s to achieve improved blood sug ar control with a continuous preset basal rate of 
insulin and on -demand mealtime bolus dosing  (10-13).  RHI U-[ADDRESS_1235432] 
demonstrated efficacy and safety using U-100 RHI in V -Go.     
 
Available data for use of RHI U-100 with V -Go (14-16) 
 
Stability Study  
For insulin  delivery devices it is important to assess the stability of the insulin used within the 
device, to understand if different types of insulin have differing stability profiles, and to 
determine if insulin stability is impacted by [CONTACT_094] -filling and storage con ditions. The purpose of the 
study was to evaluate the stability (up to 6 days) of RHI U-100 when used with V -Go.  
 
V-Go devices were filled u sing the EZ Fill™ adapter with RHI  and stored at 77°F for 1, 3, and 5 
days followed by 1 day (24 hours) at 86°F to simulate potential actual -use.  
The data demonstrated [ADDRESS_1235433]  was naive to insulin therapy prior to RHI del ivery via V -Go.  
Baseline mean A1C was 8.6% (6.0% - 10.7%) and mean insulin total daily dose (TDD) was 82 
U/day.  After 6 months, A1C was significantly reduced by 0.7% (p=0.029) and mean TDD 
decreased to 61 U/day reflecting a 26% insulin dose reduction as shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1235434]  per month for insulin 
therapy was $568 which was reduced to $[ADDRESS_1235435]  reported severe hypoglycemia

RHI and 4 tra nsitioned to RHI following the use of rapid acting insulin (RAI) first in V -Go.  
Hierarchical linear models were developed for statistical evaluations. A1C results over time are 
shown in Figure 2 .  Model adjusted A1C and TDD decreased significantly from ba seline 
(p<0.001), with a least squares mean change of -1.8% in A1C and -46 U/day in TDD following a 
mean of 194  + [ADDRESS_1235439] s. Weight did not significantly change 
from baseline (p=0.175). Regardless of initiating V -Go therapy with RHI or transitioning to RHI 
from RAI, similar changes in A1C, insulin, and weight were observed over time.

• Date of birth  
• Sex 
• Ethnicity  
• Race  
 
14 
 Medical History  
Medical history will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1) and Day 0 (Visit 2). Medical history is a 
medical event that the subject has experienced in the past , not including past surgeries or 
procedures . There must be medical records present in the subject’s source documents to verify 
the subject’s med ical history.  
 
Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications  will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1), Day 0 (Visit 2), Week 2 (Visit 
3) and Week 12 (Visit 4). A concomitant medication is any treatment received by [CONTACT_883017] (RAI or RHI via V -Go). All concomitant medications 
should be documented in the subject’s source documents . This  includes a ll medications that the 
subject takes at any time during the clinical study,  beginning at Screening (Visit 1) . Additionally, 
all medications taken in the 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1)  should be reported.  
 
Body Weight, Height, and Body Mass Index (B MI) 
Body weight, height, and BMI will be completed  at Screening (Visit 1). Body weight will also be 
completed at Week 12 (Visit 4). Body weight should be measured  without shoes on, wearing 
only light clothing and is recorded as pounds  (lb) to the nearest one decimal place, preferably 
using  the same scale throughout the study . Height should be measured  without shoes on, in 
inches  (in) and recorded to the  nearest one decimal place.  BMI  will be calculated once the height 
and weight  are obtained using the Nati onal Institute of Health BMI calculator 
(www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm ) 
 
Physical Exam  
A complete physical examination will be completed  at Day 0 (Visit 2) and Week 12 (Visit 4) and 
should include general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose,  throat, neck, cardiovascular, lungs, 
abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, neurological, skin, and musculoskeletal.  
 
Pregnancy Test  
Females who are of child -bearing potential being considered for participation in the trial will be 
given a pr egnancy test at Screening (Visit 1). Childbearing potential will be obtained at 
Screening (Visit 1).  
 
Hemoglobin A1c  (A1c)  
A1c will be a ssessed at Screening (Visit 1) and Week 12 (Visit 4) , via the central laboratory for 
the study.   
15 
 Vital Signs ( Blood Pressure  and Pulse)  
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 0 
(Visit 2) and Week 12 (Visit 4) on the non-dominant arm . Blood pressure and pulse should be 
measured with the subject in a sitting  position a fter the subject has been resting for at least [ADDRESS_1235454]’s legs should be  uncrossed with the soles of the feet flat on the ground.  
Blood pressure must be measured using a  calibrated digital blood pressure monitoring device.  
 
V-Go Insulin Dosin g Adjustment and Data Collection  
Modification  of a subject’s pre -existing insulin dosing regimen may be required during the  study,  
due to changes in diet, activity, and potential effects of changing insulin from RAI to U-[ADDRESS_1235455] safety. Overall g lucose control 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_883018] (ADA).

Time of Target Blood Glucose 
Measurement  Self-Monitored Blood Glu cose (SMBG) Target *  
Pre-prandial Plasma Glucose   80 to <1 30 mg/dL  
Peak Postprandial Plasma Glucose  < 180 mg/dL  
*More or less stringent glycemic targets  may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should be individualized based on 
duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, 
hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient conside rations.  
 
Postprandial glucose measurements should be made 1 –2 h after the beginning of the meal, generally peak levels in patients 
with diabetes.  
 
Prandial hypoglycemia should be addressed by [CONTACT_883019] 
V-Go option (ba sal rate) should be made depending on the subject  fasting glucose and in the case 
of hypoglycemia , nocturnal hypoglycemia  or severe hyperglycemia.  If consistent or repeated  
blood glucose levels  are lower than the target range and/or frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_883006]-prandial or 
pre-prandial hypoglycemia  are recorded , then an assessment of the subject  to evaluate physical 
activity and carbohydrate intake prior to considering a reduction in prandial insulin dose, may be 
required.  
 
16 
 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose  (SMBG)  
Subjects should bring their glucose meter with them to each study visit to  ensure that it is 
functioning properly and for review of SMBG results.  All subjects do not need to utilize the 
same brand of glucose meter; however, all subjects will use their own  glucometer and that meter 
should remain  the same throughout the study.  In the event that a glucose meter is changed or 
replaced by [CONTACT_423], the investigator will be notified.  Subjects will be provided with a paper 
diary to record all SMBG measurement s.   
Subjects should be instructed to measure a minimum of [ADDRESS_1235456] of fasting (pre -morning meal)  and either  a pre-evening meal or pre-bedtime. Subjects 
should be informed that checking their blood glucose at additional tim es throughout the day is 
recommended. In addition, subjects should obtain additional readings, as needed, in they 
experience hypoglycemic symptoms, and contact [CONTACT_883020] s.  
 
Seven -Point Se lf-Monitoring Blood Glucose  (SMBG)  
Subjects must  be instructed to perform required 7-point SMBG profiles prior to  3 visits during 
the study (Visits 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4 ). Each 7 -point profile should be completed over a 1 -day 
period , within the 3 days prior to each study visit when a 7 -point profile is required (Visits 2, 
Visit 3, and Visit 4 ). The 7-point profile consists of 7 SMBG  measurements on the same day at 
pre-morning meal (fasting), pre-midday meal, pre -evening meal, and [ADDRESS_1235457] does not meet inclusion and/or exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit or 
Randomization Visit, the subject may be re -screened at a later time.  
 
The following conditions are pre -requisites of re -screening:  
• Before re -screening, new written informed consent must be obtained  
• Allocation of a new subject identification number  
• All assessments for the study must be repeated  
• A minimum of 1 month between the initial Screening Visit and re -screening  
 
 
 
17 
 Randomization   
Randomization will occur at the second visit (7 -14 days from visit 1 -screening). The study 
statistician will generate a blocked randomization scheme (1:1 treatment allocation ratio) ,, 
stratified by  [CONTACT_883021]  A1c (<9%, ≥9%).    The randomization assig nments will be concealed 
and will  revealed only after the enrolled participant has completed all baseline assessments,  
including the 7-point glucose profile , and it is time to allocate the intervention to the study 
subject.  Opaque envelopes labeled for ea ch HbA1c stratum will sent to each study site to be 
opened in enrollment order within each stratum.  Authorized study personnel will then obtain the 
randomization assignment after providing the Subject ID and corresponding stratification 
information.  Eligib le subject s will be randomized to either stay on RAI delivered by V -Go (RAI 
cohort) or randomized to switch to U-100 RHI delivered by V -Go (RHI cohort)  at Day 0 (Visit 
2).  
 
NIGLM will remain stable with the exception of the removal of a medication due to documented 
clinically significant hypoglycemia during the screening process.   
Subject s switched from RAI to U-100 RHI in their V -Go will be expected to fill the new U -100 
RHI prescription within 48 hours of Day 0 (Visit 2) and obtain the U-[ADDRESS_1235458] s will also be educated on potential risks associated with U-100 
RHI.  
 
Subjects randomized to U-100 RHI in V -Go will be instructed to dose (click) 20 minutes before 
meals and snacks. Subjects randomized to continue  RAI will be instructed to dose (click) 5 
minutes before meals  and snacks .

5.6 Data Analysis  
 
5.6.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_4305] (Beverley Huet), who has 
extensive experience in clinical trials analysis.  
Primary analysis: The primary analysis will be  the per-protocol analysis comparing HbA1c 
response because, in n on-inferiority hypothesis testing, the i ntention -to-treat analysis may 
be biased toward the null hypothesis. The per -protocol population is defined as the 
population who continued the assigned intervention as randomized for the duration of the 
study period , comp leting the end of study week 12 visit (V4) . The non -inferiority of U-100 
RHI treatment strategy compared to  rapid acting insulin regimen will be assessed using a  
95% confidence interval for the between treatment group net difference ( Visit 4 minus 
Visit 1) in HbA1c at end of study. This 95% confidence interval will be derived from the 
differences of least square means estimated from a mixed -effects  model repeated measures 
analysis.  The study subject will be modelled as a random effect.  Non-inferiority of U-100 
RHI treatment  will be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less 
than the non -inferiority margin of 0.4%.    
Secondary analyses: Intention -to-treat (ITT) which will include all randomized participants 
who receive at least one dose of a study medication  will be performed as a secondary 
analysis . HbA1c will be compared in a mixed -effects model which can accommodate cases 
with missing data in the ITT analysis data set, assuming the data are missing at random.  
After evaluation of the  non-inferiority of U -100 RHI hypothesis, the superiority of the 
HbA1c as a secondary endpoint will be tested  in a fixed sequence;  if the primary hypothesis 
of non -inferiority is significant then superiority will be tested . This ana lysis will be 
20 
 performed in both the per -protocol and ITT data sets. Secondary analyses will assess 
baseline covariates and their association with treatment efficacy.  Group comparisons and 
changes from baseline over time (study visits) of continuous seconda ry outcome variables 
will be analysed with mixed -effects model repeated measures analysis. Hypoglycemic 
events, as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS] , will summarized as percent of participants with at 
least one event and will be compared between treatment groups with Fisher’s exact test. 
Hypoglycemic events will also be summarized as events per person time and analyzed with 
Poisson or negative binomial regression models.  Safety endpoints and other adverse events 
will be summarized in detail with descriptive stati stics. The analysis of safety data will be 
performed for the ITT population.   
Model assumptions regarding normality and covariance structure will be carefully 
assessed. Nonparametric tests or data transformations will be used if necessary to meet 
assumpti ons. Statistical analysis will be performed with SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary 
NC), particularly Proc Mixed for linear models with both fixed and random effects.  A two -
sided alpha <5% will be considered significant for all analyses  unless otherwise spe cified . 
Interim analysis. After 75% of the participants are randomized,  the Data Safety and 
Monitoring Committee ( DMSC) will evaluate a simple analysis for the purpose of 
reassessment of sample size . The DSMC will be asked to evaluate  our initial power and 
sample size assumptions and estimation based on accumulated HbA1c results. Based on 
this limited analysis , the final study sample size may be modified  and the DSMC  will 
approve the final study sample size.   If any subsequent formal efficacy interim analysis is 
undertaken, the type I error rate will be controlled using a Lan -Demets alpha -spending 
function with O -Brien -Fleming boundaries  for testing the primary non -inferiority HbA1c 
endpoint.  This will include calculation of the confid ence interval (and p -value) for testing 
the non -inferiority hypothesis  in relation to the O -Brien -Fleming group sequential 
boundaries  (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_70663]) . The per -protocol analysis is the primary  analysis for 
comparing  the HbA1c week [ADDRESS_1235459] of the prescribed insulin. Costs of insulin will be based on current 
published wholesale acquisition costs (WAC) and reported in U.S. dollars.

6 SAFETY MONITORING  
 
6.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be monitored through out 
the study.  All AEs and SAEs will be reported to the  Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_883007], Inc  
regardless of whether they are considered study related.  The date and time of onset and 
outcome, seriousness, intensity, action taken, and causality to study treatment will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_9154].    
 
6.2 Definitions  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical study. This includes a clinically significant worsening of a  concomitant 
illness  and clinical laboratory abnormalities which are clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality 
that suggests a disease and is  of a severity that requires active management.   The event does not 
need to be causally related to the device  or clinical study.  
 
The following definitions are used when assessing  the intensity of an AE:  
• Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : marked symptoms, moderate interference with  the subject’s daily activi ties. 
• Severe : considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable.  
 
23 
 The following definitions are used when assessing  the causality (relationship) of an AE:  
• Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility.  The Investigator must further qualify the degree of certainty as “possible” or 
“probable.”  
o Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.  
o Probable: Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal 
relationship.  
• Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility.  
 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are:  
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment;  
• The course of the event, considering especially the effect of the discontinuation of study 
treatment or the reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable;  
• Whether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other similar 
treatments;  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event; and,  
• The presence of non -study treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the o ccurrence of the event.  
 
The following definitions are used when assessing the outcome  of an AE:  
• Recovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_36303] -related activity after the 
subject signed the ICF.  
• Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover 
from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has 
died from another AE.  
• Recove red/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE.  
• Not recovered/not resolved: The con dition of the subject has not improved and the 
symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known.  
• Unknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow -up. 
 
24 
 A serious advers e event  (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dos e: 
• Results in death ; 
• Is life -threatening (i .e., the subject  was at immediate risk  of death from the AE  as it occurred; 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to 
continue, might have caused death) ; 
• Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; 
• Results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is a medically important event.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1235465] ’s AEs and SAEs will  be recorded and reported from the signing of the informed 
consent form to the subject ’s last study visit. All SAEs must be reported to Valeritas by 
[CONTACT_577541].  The investigative sites are to report all SAEs by [CONTACT_883022] [ADDRESS_1235466] information for SAE reporting is:  
V-Go Customer Care (VCC)  
Phone:  [PHONE_18276]  (toll-free)  
 
 Hypoglycemic Events  
  
Reported hypoglycemia will be analyzed according to the following definitions according 
to the International Hypoglycemia Study Group .[13]  
 
Level 1  A glucose alert value of 70mg/dL or less  
Level 2  A glucose level of less than 54mg/dL is sufficiently low to indicate 
serious, clinically important hypoglycemia  
Level 3  Severe hypoglycemia, as defined by [CONTACT_30158], denotes severe 
cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery . 
 
Hypoglyc emia, as defined above, will be reported by [CONTACT_883023] : 
Incidence will be reported as the percentage of subject s in a treatment group reporting at 
least one event for the duration of the study.   
 
[ADDRESS_1235467]  complaint information includes, but not limited to the following:  
• Any type of unusual local or bodily reaction to a device  
• Alleged non -sterility  
• Alleged product failure -design defect or abnormal functional behavior  
• Improper use of the product  whether or not physical injury or product failure results  
• User error in handling the product regardless of final outcome to the subject  
• Packaging or product labeling misunderstandings

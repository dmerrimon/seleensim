Numero us growth factors and cytokines are involved in the angiogenic process.  Among 
these factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a predominant role as a central 
mediator of tumor -related angiogenesis, and its expression has been shown to be an a dverse 
prognostic factor for a number of solid tumors [Folkman, 1971; Folkman 1997; Ferrara, 
1997].  
Pazopanib is an orally -bioavailable, ATP -competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR ( -
1, -2, and -3), PDGFR ( - and -), and c -Kit [Kumar, 2007].  Pazop anib is being developed 
by [CONTACT_35316] ([COMPANY_004]) for the treatment of a variety of cancers.  In nonclinical 
experiments, pazopanib has demonstrated encouraging potency and selectivity for VEGF 
receptors: for example, pazopanib demonstrated significant inhi bition of VEGF -induced 
VEGFR -2 phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and was 3 - to 400 -fold 
selective for VEGF receptors compared to 23 other kinases tested.  Pazopanib showed 
significant growth inhibition of a variety of human tumor xe nografts in mice, and also 
inhibited angiogenesis in several different models of angiogenesis (e.g., the Matrigel plug 
assay, the cornea micropocket, and the laser -induced choroidal neovascularization models).  
Further physico -chemical characteristics of p azopanib as well as more detailed results of 
nonclinical studies are described in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) [ Ariazi, 201 4]. 
As of the clinical data cut -off date for th e current  IB, 09 September 2013, 47 [COMPANY_004] -sponsored 
studies of pazopanib (plus 1 additional stud y initiated by [CONTACT_6812]) have been conducted or 
are in progress in adult subjects with cancer  including renal cell cancer (RCC), non -small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma (STS), cervical 
cancer, color ectal cancer, hepatocellular cancer (HCC), multiple myeloma (MM), and 
glioma . Approximately [ADDRESS_1267161] received pazopanib as mo notherapy or in 
combination out of approximately 7000 subjects  enrolled in pazopanib oncology clinical 
studies as of the cut-off.  Data collected to date show that oral pazopanib is absorbed after 
administration and that pazopanib administration at 800 mg daily is associated with a 
reasonable safety profile and encouraging efficacy in various oncology settings  [Ariazi, 
2014]. 
 
Clinical data indicate that (a) pazopanib is absorbed after oral administration, (b) the 800 mg 
daily dosing regimen is an active monotherapy dose for subjects with cancer, providing 
optimal biologic and clinical effects associated with VEGFR inhibition , (c) pazopanib is 
generally well -tolerated at the 800 mg daily dosing regimen, and (d) pazopanib has 
encouraging efficacy in specific tumor settings such as RCC, sarcoma, NSCLC, cervical and

 ovarian cancer.   In 2009, p azopanib was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Foo d and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)  [Votrient PI, 
2014].  In 2012, pazopanib  was FDA -approved for the treatment of patients with advanced 
soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemoth erapy.  However, the efficacy of 
pazopanib for the treatment of patients with adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma or gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors has not been demonstrated [Votrient PI, 201 4]. 
 
Renal Cell Carcinoma   
The safety and efficacy of pazopanib  in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were evaluated in a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial. Patients (N = 435) 
with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who had received either no prior therapy or one 
prior cytokine -based syst emic therapy were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib  800 mg 
once daily or placebo once daily. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate and 
compare the 2 treatment arms for progression -free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoints 
included overa ll survival (OS), overall response rate (RR), and duration of response.  
Of the total of 435 patients enrolled in this trial, 233 patients had no prior systemic therapy 
(treatment -naïve su bgroup) and 202 patients received one prior IL -2 or INFα -based therapy 
(cytokine -pretreated subgroup). The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were 
balanced between the pazopanib  and placebo arms. The majority of patients were male (71%) 
with a median age of 59 years. Eighty -six percent of patients were Caucasian, 14% were 
Asian, and less than 1% were other. Forty -two percent were ECOG performance status 0 and 
58% were ECOG performance status 1. All patients had clear cell histology (90%) or 
predominantly clear cell histology (10%). Approximately 50% of all patients had [ADDRESS_1267162] common metastatic sites at baseline were 
lung (74%), lymph nodes (56%), bone (27%), and liver (25%).  
A similar proport ion of patients in each arm were treatment -naïve and cytokine -pretreated. In 
the cytokine -pretreated subgroup, the majority (75%) had received interferon -based 
treatment. Similar proportions of patients in each arm had prior nephrectomy (89% and 88% 
for pazopanib  and placebo, respectively).  
The analysis of the primary endpoint PFS was based on disease assessment by [CONTACT_903450].  At the protocol -specified final analysis of 
OS, the median OS was 22.9 months f or patients randomized to pazopanib  and 20.5 months 
for the placebo arm [HR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.16)]. The median OS for the placebo arm 
includes 79 patients (54%) who discontinued  placebo treatment because of disease 
progression and crossed over to tre atment with pazopanib . In the placebo arm, 95 (66%) 
patients received at least one systemic anti -cancer treatment after progression compared to 88 
(30%) patients randomized to pazopanib [Votrient PI, 201 4].

 The safety and efficacy of pazopanib  in patients with STS were evaluated in a Phase III, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter trial. Patients (N = 369) with 
metastatic STS who had received prior chemotherapy, including anthracycline treatment, or 
were unsuited fo r such therapy, were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib  800 mg once 
daily or placebo. Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) or adipocytic sarcoma 
were excluded from the trial. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_903451] (WHO PS) 0 or 1 at baseline and the number of lines of prior systemic 
therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 versus 2+). Progression -free survival (PFS) was 
assessed by [CONTACT_320191]. Other efficacy endpoints included overall 
surviv al (OS), overall response rate, and duration of response.  
 
The majority of patients were female (59%) with a median age of 55 years. Seventy -two 
percent of patients were Caucasian, 22% were Asian, and 6% were Other. Forty -three percent 
of patients had lei omyosarcoma, 10% had synovial sarcoma, and 47% had other soft tissue 
sarcomas. Fifty -six percent of patients had received 2 or more lines of prior systemic therapy 
and 44% had received 0 or 1 lines of prior systemic therapy. The median  duration of 
treatmen t was 4.5 months for patients on the pazopanib arm and 1.9 months for patients on 
the placebo arm.  At the protocol -specified final analysis of OS, the median OS was 12.6 
months for patients randomized to pazopanib  and 10.7 months for the placebo arm [HR = 
0.87 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.12)]  [Votrient PI, 201 4].

Diarrhea : Diarrhea occurred frequently and was predominantly mild to moderate in severity 
in both the  RCC and STS clinical trials. Patients should be advised how to manage mild 
diarrhea and to notify their healthcare provider if moderate to severe diarrhea occurs so 
appropriate management can be implemented to minimize its impact.  
Lipase Elevations : In a single -arm RCC trial, increases in lipase values were observed for 
27% (48/181) of patients. Elevations in lipase as an adverse reaction were reported for 4%

Pneumothorax : Two of 290 patients treated with pazopanib  and no patient on the placebo 
arm in the randomized RCC trial developed a pneumothorax. In the randomized trial of 
pazopan ib for the treatment of STS, pneumothorax occurred in 3% (8/240) of patients treated 
with pazopanib  and in no patients on the placebo arm.  
Bradycardia : In the randomized trial of pazopanib for the treatment of RCC, bradycardia 
based on vital signs (<60 bea ts per minute) was observed in 19% (52/280) of patients treated 
with pazopanib and in 11% (16/144) of patients on the placebo arm.  Bradycardia was 
reported as an adverse reaction in 2% (7/290) of patients treated with pazopanib compared to

1.2.3.  Warnings and  Precautions  for use  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Impairment  
Hepatic Effec ts: Cases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during 
the use of pazopanib. In clinical trials with pazopanib, increase in serum tra nsaminases 
(ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and bilirubin were observed (see Undesirable 
Effects). In the majori ty of the cases, isolated increases in ALT and AST have been 
reported, without concomitant elevations of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubi n.  Patients 
over 60  years of age may be at greater risk for ALT >[ADDRESS_1267173].  Patients who carry  the 
HLA-B*57:[ADDRESS_1267174] majority  (over 90%) of all transaminase elevations of a ny grade 
occurred in the first 18 weeks.  Grades are based on the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3 (NCI CTCA E). 
Monitor serum liver tests before initiation of treatment with pazopanib  and at Weeks 3, 5,7 
and 9. Thereafter, monitor at Month 3 and at Month 4,  and as clinical ly indicated. Periodic 
monitoring should then continue after  Month 4.  
 The following guidel ines are provided for patients with baseline values of total bilirubin  
1.[ADDRESS_1267175] and ALT [ADDRESS_1267176].

  Patients with isolated ALT elevations between [ADDRESS_1267177] may be 
continued on pazopanib with week ly monitoring of liver function until AL T return to 
Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE, defined in Version 3 as <2.[ADDRESS_1267178]) or baseline.  
 
 Patients with A LT of >[ADDRESS_1267179] pazopanib interrupted until they  return to 
Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline.  If the potential benefit for reinitiating pazopanib 
treatment is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicit y, then reintroduce 
pazopanib at a redu ced dose of 400 mg once dai ly and measure serum liver tests 
week ly for 8 weeks  (see Posology and  Method of Administration ). Following 
reintroduction of pazop anib, if ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_1267180] recur, then pazopanib 
should be permanently  discontinued.  
If ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_1267181] occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations >[ADDRESS_1267182] pazopanib should be permanently discontinued.  Patients should be monitored 
until re turn to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE) or baseline.  Pazopanib is a UGT1A1 
inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients 
with Gilbert’s syndrome.  Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, 
knownor suspected Gilbert’s  syndrome, and elevation in ALT >[ADDRESS_1267183] should be 
managed as per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations.  
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations ( see 
Interactions ) and should be undertaken with c aution and close monitoring . 
Beyond recommending that patients with mild hepatic impairment are treated with [ADDRESS_1267184] not been fully  established (see Warnings and  Precautions for Us e). 
 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment as defined by 
[CONTACT_14427] (ALT) and biliru bin (see Clinical Pharmacolog y). 
 
The dose of pazopanib should be reduced to 200  mg per  day in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment.  
 
There are insufficient data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 
times the upper limit of n ormal [X U LN] regardless of any  level of ALT); therefore, 
pazopanib is no t recommended in these patie nts

 [IP_ADDRESS].  QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes  
In the RCC trials of pazopanib, QT prolongation ( > 500 msec) was identified on routine 
electrocardiogram monito ring in 2% (11/558) of patients.  Torsades de pointes occurred in < 
1% (2/977) of patients who received pazopanib in the monotherapy trials.  
In the randomized RCC and STS trials, 1% (3/290) of patients and 0.2% (1/240) of patients, 
respectively, who receiv ed pazopanib had post -baseline values between [ADDRESS_1267185] -baseline QTc values > 500 msec.  
Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, 
in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and 
those with relevant pre -existing cardiac  disease.  
When using pazopanib, baseline and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and 
maintenance of electro lytes (calcium, magnesium, potassium) within normal range is 
recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cardiac Dysfunction  
In clinical trials with pazopanib, events of car diac d ysfunction such as congestive heart 
failure and decreased  left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) have occurred.  In a 
randomised RCC trial of pazopanib compared with sunitinib, in subjects who had baseline 
and follo w-up LVEF measurements, m yocardi al dysfunction was observed in 13% 
(47/362) of subjects in the pazopanib arm compared to 11% (42/369) of subjects in the 
sunitinib arm.  Congestive heart failure was observed in 0.5% of subjects in each 
treatment arm. In the phase III  STS clinical trial, c ongestive heart failure was reported in 3 
out of 240 subjects (1%).  In this trial decreases in LVEF in subjects who had post -
baseline measurement were detected in 11% (16/142) in the pazopanib arm compared with 
5% (2/40) in the placebo arm. Fourteen of th e [ADDRESS_1267186] exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at 
risk (e.g., those with prior anthrac ycline thera py) by [CONTACT_903452] r-load.  Blood 
pressure should be monitored and manag ed promptly  using a combination of anti -
hypertensive thera py and dose modification of pazopanib (interruption and r e-initiation at 
a reduced dose based on clinical judgment). Patients should be carefully  monitored for 
clinical signs or s ymptoms of congesti ve heart failure. Baseline and periodic evaluation of 
LVEF is recommended in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hemorrhagic Events  
Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.9% (5/586) in the RCC trials; there were no reports of fatal 
hemorrhage in the STS trial s.  In the randomized RCC trial, 13% (37/290) of patients treated 
with pazopanib and 5% (7/145) of patients on placebo experienced at least [ADDRESS_1267187] common hemorrhagic events in the patients treated with pazopanib were 
hematuria (4%),  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (2%), hemoptysis (2%), and rectal hemorrhage (1%).  Nine of 37 
patients treated with pazopanib who had hemorrhagic events experienced serious events 
including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary hemorrhage.  One percent (4/290) of 
patients treated with pazopanib died from hemorrhage compared with no (0/145) patients on 
placebo.  In the overall safety population in RCC (N=586), cerebral/intracranial hemorrhage 
was observed in < 1% (2/586) of patients treated with pazopanib.  
In the rando mized STS trial, 22% (53/240) of patients treated with pazopanib compared to 
8% (10/123) treated with placebo experienced at least [ADDRESS_1267188] 
common hemorrhagic events were epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (8%), mouth hemorrhage (3%), and anal 
hemorrhage (2%) .  Grade 4 hemorrhagic events in the STS population occurred in 1% 
(3/240) patients and included intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 
peritoneal hemorrhage.   
Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cer ebral, or 
clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months and should not be used 
in those patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Arterial Thrombo embolic  Events  
Fatal arterial thromboembolic events were observed in 0.3% (2/586) of patients in the RCC 
trials and in no patients in the STS trials.  In the randomized RCC trial, 2% (5/290) of 
patients receiving pazopanib experienced myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.3% (1/290) 
had a cerebrovascular accident, and 1% (4/290) had an event of transient ischemic attack.   In 
the randomized STS trial, 2% (4/240) of patients receiving pazopanib experienced a 
myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.4% (1/240) had a cerebrovascular accident and there 
were no incidents of transient ischemic attack.  No arterial thrombotic events were reported 
in patients who received placebo in either trial.  Pazopanib should be used with caution in 
patients who are at increased risk for these events or who have had a history of these events.  
Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have ha d an arterial thrombotic event within 
the previous 6 months and should not be used in those patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Venous Thromboembolic Events  
In RCC and STS trials of pazopanib, venous thromboembolic events including venous 
thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolus have  occurred.  In the randomized STS trial, venous 
thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with pazopanib compared to 
2% with placebo.  In the randomized RCC trial, the rate was 1% in both arms.  Fatal 
pulmonary embolus occurred in 1% (2 /240) of STS patients receiving pazopanib and in no 
patients receiving placebo.  There were no fatal pulmonary emboli in the RCC trial.  Monitor 
for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Thrombotic Microangiopathy  
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including th rombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), has been reported in clinical trials of pazopanib as 
monotherapy, in combination with bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan.  
Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combina tion with other agents.  Six of the 7 TMA cases 
occurred within 90 days of the initiation of pazopanib.  Improvement of TMA was observed 
after treatment was discontinued.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of TMA.  Permanently 
discontinue pazopanib in patient s developi[INVESTIGATOR_903435]. Manage as clinically indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula  
In the RCC and STS trials, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.9% (5/586) of 
patients and 1% (4/382) of patients receiving pazopanib, respectively.   Fatal perforations 
occurred in 0.3% (2/586) of these patients in the RCC trials and in 0.3% (1/382) of these 
patients in the STS trials.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or 
fistula.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndr ome / Reversible Posterior 
Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome  
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) / Reversible Posterior 
Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been reported in patients receiving pazopanib 
and may be fatal.   
PRES/ RPLS is a neur ological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, 
confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances.  Mild to severe 
hypertension may be present.  The diagnosis of PRES/ RPLS is optimally confirmed by 
[CONTACT_9252].  Permanently d iscontinue pazopanib in patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_698441]/ RPLS.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypertension  
In clinical trials, h ypertension (systolic blood pressure > 150 or diastolic blood pressure > 
100 mm Hg) and hypertensive crisis were observed in patients treated wi th pazopanib.  
Blood pressure should be well  controlled prior to initiating pazopanib.  Hypertension occurs 
early in the course of treatment (40% of cases occurred by [CONTACT_2006] 9 and 90% of cases occurred 
in the first 18 weeks).  Blood pressure should be monitor ed early after starting treatment (no 
longer than one week) and frequently thereafter to ensure blood pressure control.  
Approximately 40% of patients who received pazopanib experienced hypertension.  Grade 3 
hypertension was reported in 4% to 7% of patien ts receiving pazopanib.  
Increased blood pressure should be treated promptly with standard anti -hypertensive therapy 
and dose reduction or interruption of pazopanib as clinically warranted.  Pazopanib should be 
discontinued if there is evidence of hypertens ive crisis or if hypertension is severe and

patients required permanent discontinuation of pazopanib because of hypertension.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Wound Healing  
No formal trials on the effe ct of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted.  Since 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) inhibitors such as pazopanib may impair 
wound healing, treatment with pazopanib should be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled 
surgery.  T he decision to resume pazopanib after surgery should be based on clinical 
judgment of adequate wou nd healing.  Pazopanib should be discontinued in patients with 
wound dehiscence.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypothyroidism  
Hypothyroidism, confirmed based on a simultaneous rise of TSH and decline of T4, was 
reported in 7% (19/290) of patients treated with pazopanib in the randomized RCC trial and 
in 5% (11/240) of patients treated with pazopanib in the randomized STS trial.  No patients 
on the placebo arm of either trial had hypothyroid ism.  In RCC and STS trials of pazopanib, 
hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse reaction in 4% (26/586) and 5% (20/382) of 
patients, respectively.  Proactive monitoring of thyroid function tests is recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Proteinuria  
In the randomized RCC trial,  proteinuria was reported as an adverse reaction in 9% (27/290) 
of patients receiving pazopanib and in no patients receiving placebo.  In 2 patients, 
proteinuria led to discontinuation of treatment with pazopanib.  In the randomized STS trial, 
proteinuria was reported as an adverse reaction in 1% (2/240) of patients, and nephrotic 
syndrome was reported in 1 patient treated with pazopanib compared to none in patients 
receiving placebo.  Treatment was withdrawn in the patient with nephrotic syndrome.  
Baselin e and periodic urinalysis during treatment is recommended with follow up 
measurement of 24 -hour urine protein as clinically indicated.  Interrupt pazopanib and dose

reported in association with pazopanib.  Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative 
of ILD/pneumon itis and discontinue pazopanib in patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_903437].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Increased Toxicity with Other Cancer Therapy  
Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combination with other agents.  Clinical trials of 
pazopanib in combination with pemetrexed and lap atinib were terminated early due to 
concerns over increased toxicity and mortality.  The fatal toxicities observed included 
pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death.  A safe and effective 
combination dose has not been established  with these regimens.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Increased Toxicity in Developi[INVESTIGATOR_903438].  
Pazopanib is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.  Based on its mechanism of action, 
pazopanib  may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation during early post -natal 
development.  Administration of pazopanib to juvenile rats less than 21 days old resulted in 
toxicity to the lungs, liver, heart, and kidney and in death at doses significantly  lower than 
the clinically recommended dose or doses tolerated in older animals.  Pazopanib may 
potentially cause serious adverse effects on organ development in pediatric patients, 
particularly in patients  younger than 2 years of age.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
As of [ADDRESS_1267189] 2014, the patient underwent an elective caesarian 
section in order for her to receive chemothera py due to malignancy progression.  An infant 
male was delivered unevent fully, although prematurely  at27 weeks gestation.  The 
investigator noted that no aes associated with the patient’s pazopanib treatment were 
observed.  
In addition to the above reports, a spontaneous report of congenital anomalies in an infant 
whose mother received pazopanib is described in the marketing experience : 
One report describing the use of pazopanib up to the first trimester of pregnanc y, for an 
unapproved indication (of f-label use) has been received up to [ADDRESS_1267190] 2014, the patient delivered a ba by 
[CONTACT_903453] 38 weeks gestation.  The bab y’s APGAR scores were [ADDRESS_1267191], aortic coarctation, an d 
partial anomalous pulmonary  venous return.  The baby  [CONTACT_903454] “doing well and thriving” post -surger y.  The patient resumed pazopanib 
following delivery  until about [ADDRESS_1267192] to the fetus.  Women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking pazopanib.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Interactions  
Concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or P -gp should be avoided due to 
risk of increased exposure to pa zopanib.  Selection of alternative concomitant medicinal 
products with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 or P -gp should be considered.  
 
1.3. Pazopanib Monotherapy Dose Rationale  
Pazopanib 800 mg once daily is the recommended monotherapy dose based on cl inical and 
preclinical results.  Once daily doses of 50 mg to 2000 mg pazopanib were investigated in the 
“First Time in Human”, Phase I Study VEG10003.  Increases in the pazopanib dose above 
[ADDRESS_1267193] (EC 50) in both 
concentration -effect relationships were similar (21.3 g/mL and 15.3 g/mL) and 
demonstrate that th ere is a consistent inhibition of VEGF receptor(s) in subjects with cancer 
when plasma pazopanib concentrations are maintained above 15 g/mL.  The plasma 
pazopanib EC 50 values for biologic effects observed in the clinical studies are similar to the 
plasma  concentration of 40 M (17.5 g/mL) required for optimal inhibition of VEGFR -2 
phosphorylation in mice [[COMPANY_004] Report RH2003/[ZIP_CODE]/00].

 Progression Free Survival (PFS) in subjects with renal cell cancer in study VEG102616 was 
compared between subjects whose trough plasma pazopanib concentrations at Week 4 were 
above or below selected threshold values that were distributed evenly across the observed 
predose concentrations.  Subjects with trough concentrations above the threshold values had 
significantly better  PFS, compared to the remaining subjects, when the threshold 
concentrations were 12.6 g/mL, 17.4 g/mL, and 20.7 g/mL.  Use of thresholds higher 
than 21 g/mL did not result in a significant difference in PFS between subject s above and 
below the threshol d.  Using thresholds of 15 g/mL and 20.7 g/mL, subject s with trough 
concentrations above the thresholds also had significantly better response rate and tumor 
shrinkage than the remaining subject s. 
Pazopanib C24 at steady -state was greater than 15 g/mL i n 93% of subjects who received 
800 mg once daily in Study VEG10003.  Individual subjects receiving pazopanib doses 
below 800  mg once daily can achieve plasma concentrations over 15 g/mL, albeit at a lower 
frequency compared with what is observed at [ADDRESS_1267194] Phase III study of pazopanib (800 mg once daily) versus placebo 
in treatment -naïve and cytokine -pretreated subject s with RCC .  In this study, the median 
progression -free survival in the pazopanib arm was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4, 12.9) compared 
to 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8, 4.2) in the placebo arm.  This finding represented a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS in response to pazopanib monotherapy (HR 0.46, 95% CI 
0.34 to 0.62, p<0.0000001).  In addition, the response rate (defined as the percentage of 
subjects achieving either a confirmed complete or partial response according to RECIST) in 
the pazopanib arm was  30% versus 3% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of 
response in pazopanib -treated subjects was 58.7 weeks.  Results from Study VEG105192 
therefore clearly indicate that an 800 mg once daily dose of pazopanib is highly effective in 
treating subjec ts with advanced RCC.  
2. STUDY RATIONALE  
Bone sarcomas (BS) are uncommon mesenchymal malignancies. In 2009, the estimated 
number of new cases of BS in the [LOCATION_002] will be 2,570, which will account for only 
0.2% of all newly diagnosed cancers [Jemal, 200 6; Fletcher, 2002].  
Chondrosarcoma is the second most common malignant primary tumor of bone, with about 
400 new cases per year [Yasko, 2008] .  Chondrosarcomas are generally indolent, malignant 
tumors of bone that are characterized by [CONTACT_903455].  
More than 90% are designated conventional chondrosarcomas.  Approximately 90% of these 
are low -grade to intermediate -grade tumors (grade 1 to 2), which have indolent clinical 
behavior and low metastatic potential.  Only 5 -10% of conventional chondrosarcomas are 
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267195] high metastatic potential [Dorfman, 1998] . Chemotherapy is 
generally recognized to be ineffective in conventional chondrosarcomas [Chow, 2007] . 
The growth, migration, and dissemination of sarc omas depend upon angiogenesis. 
Neovascularization allows for growth of the primary tumor as well as a pathway for 
migrating tumor cells to gain access to the systemic circulation and establish distant 
metastases.  
BS, unlike carcinomas, disseminate almost e xclusively through the blood; bones lack a 
lymphatic system [Malawer, 2001] . Consequently, unlike most other cancers, BS almost 
universally metastasize to the pulmonary parenchyma as their first, and most commonly, only 
site of distant spread [Malawer, 200 1]. Further, more than most other organs, the lungs 
possess a rich arterial and venous vascular supply. Additionally, elevated tumor and 
circulating VEGF levels are associated with the development of lung metastases [Shor, 
2008] . Accordingly, inhibiting ne ovascularization in BS, which have a unique proclivity to 
metastasize solely to this receptive organ, is appealing.  
Pazopanib is known to have a high degree of activity in  soft-tissue sarcoma  (STS) .  In a 
phase II trial of pazopanib for relapsed or refract ory advanced STS, the primary end point of 
progression -free rate at 12 weeks (PFR12 weeks) of 40% was achieved or nearly achieved in 
three out of four cohorts (26% liposarcomas, 44% leiomyosarcomas, 49% synovial sarcomas, 
and 39% in other STS) [Sleijfer, 2009].   
In a phase I study of pazopanib  in subject s with advanced cancer , two subjects  
with chondrosarcoma achieved stable disease for 7.6 and 19.8 months [Hurwitz, 2009].  The 
chondrosarcoma subject  who achieved stable disease for 19.8 months also had a 2 3% 
reduction in tumor [[COMPANY_004] data on file]. A treatment that reliably leads to stable disease in this 
population would represent a significant improvement over existing treatment options.  This 
study is designed to evaluate treatment with pazopanib in subjec ts with surgically

for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, 
and other significant data pertaining to the investigational product being used in this study.  
6. TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
6.1. Subject Enrollment  
Participating sites will be instructed on the procedure for enrolling subjects with Vector 
Oncology  during site training.  Subject numbers will be assigned in sequential order across 
all participating sites.   
6.2. Study Treatment  
 Pazopanib 800 mg once daily will be started on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will be administered 
continuously for a 28 -day cycle.  Subjects may continue study treatment until they develop 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
During the tre atment prior of the study, a  visit window of + / - [ADDRESS_1267216] a 
window of +/ - 1 business day.  Other vital signs are not required at these time points, and BP 
can be assessed by [CONTACT_70485] (e.g., at home or by [CONTACT_20427]) as lon g as the 
Investigator is informed of the measurement, verifies any measurement that is not normal, 
and takes appropriate action.  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  No investigational or commercial 
agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_398067] d escribed in this section may be administere d with the 
intent to treat the subject 's malignancy.  
Pazopanib should be taken orally without food at least one hour before or two hours after a 
meal.  The tablets should be swallowed whole and must not be crushed  or broken. The time

 of day the tablets are taken should be relatively cons istent . If a dose is missed, it should not 
be taken if it is less than 12 hours until the next dose.  
6.3. Pazopanib Dose Interruptions and Modifications  
Guidelines  for pazopanib  dose in terruptions/modifications in case of specific treatment -
emergent AEs are provided in the following sections.  
If pazopanib is interrupted for [ADDRESS_1267217] should be monitored for approximately 10 
to 14 days at each dose level.  If toxicity does not abate during this monitoring time, 
pazopanib may need to be interrupted and/or the dos e further decreased with continued 
monitoring for an additional 10 -14 days at each dose level, and so on.  
Pazopanib Starting Dose  800 mg once daily  
Dose Reduction 1  600 mg once daily  
Dose Reduction 2  400 mg once daily  
Dose Reduction 3  200 mg once daily  
If the toxicity has abated with reduction of the dose and dose re -escalation is considered safe 
by [CONTACT_737], the pazopanib dose can then be increased step -wise back to the pre -event 
dose (in 200 mg increments, after monitoring for 10 -14 days at e ach dose level to ensure that 
toxicity did not recur or worsen).  
If a subject’s treatment is interrupted for more than [ADDRESS_1267218] 
be removed from study treatment.  
6.3.1.  Dose Interruptions/Modifications for Specific, Non -liver Rela ted, Toxicities  
Guidelines  for pazopanib dose interruptions/modifications in case of specific treatment -
emergent AEs are provided in Table 6.  If an AE is considered unlikely to be related to 
pazopanib per Investigator’s clinical judgment , then these dose modification rules will not 
apply.

Diarrhea  
In cancer patients, diarrhea can be debilitating and potentially life threatening, with 
dehydration, renal insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalances. Pazopanib as a mono therapy has 
been associated with an increased incidence of diarrhea, which is grade 1 or 2 in the majority 
with grade 3/4 diarrhea occurring in approximately 4% of subjects.  The incidence and 
severity may increase when administered with other agents known  to cause diarrhea.  
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267228]’s Baseline bowel pattern should be established so that changes in that pattern can be 
identified.  In addition, subjects should be educ ated on signs and symptoms of diarrhea with 
instructions to report any changes in bowel pattern to the physician.  
The NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria for defining diarrhea are provided below.  
Toxicity 
Grade  Diarrhea  
(includes diarrhea of small bowel or col onic origin and/or ostomy diarrhea)  
1 Increase of <4 stools/day over Baseline; mild increase in ostomy output compared to 
Baseline  
2 Increase of 4 -6 stools/day over Baseline; moderate increase in ostomy output 
compared to Baseline  
3 Increase of 7 stool s/day over Baseline; incontinence; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374]; severe 
increase in ostomy output compared to Baseline; limiting self-care ADL  
4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death  
 
Uncomplicated diarrhea is considered mild  to moderate and defined as CTCAE Grade 1 to 2 
with no complicating signs or symptoms.  
Complicated diarrhea is severe and defined as CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 or Grade 1 or 2 with 1 or 
more of the following signs or sympt oms:  crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], nausea/vomiting ≥ Grade  2, decreased 
performance status, fever, sepsis, neutropenia  Grade 3 or 4 , frank bleeding, and/or 
dehydration.  If complicated diarrhea goes unrecognized or untreated, it may lead to death.  
Experience thus far suggests that, when pazopanib is used a s monotherapy, uncomplicated 
CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_1267229] been 
developed by [CONTACT_408916] (ASCO) panel for treating 
chemotherapy -induced diarrhea [Benson,  2004].  The guidance provided here is a 
modifica tion of the ASCO guidelines.  
Early identification and intervention is critical for the optimal management of diarrhea.  
 A subject’s Baseline bowel pattern should be established so that changes in that 
pattern can be identified.   
 Subjects should be educate d on the signs and symptoms of diarrhea with instructions 
to report any changes in bowel pattern to the physician.  
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
- 41 - 
  At the initiation of diarrhea, an assessment of frequency, consistency, duration and 
other symptoms such as fever, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_284933], nausea, vom iting, dizziness and thirst 
should be taken to identify subjects at high risk of complications.  
Management Guideline s 
Uncomplicate d diarrhea of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 : 
 Hydration:  have subject drink 8 to 10 large glasses (approximately 2 liters) of clear 
non-caffeinated liquids a day (e.g., broth or electrolyte -containing sports drinks).  
 If Grade [ADDRESS_1267230] . 
 Dietary modifications:  have subject stop all lactose -containing products and eat 
frequent, small meal s. 
 Pharmacologic intervention using loperamide : 
o Begin loperamide at initial dose of 4 mg followed by 2 mg every 4 hours or after 
every unformed stool.  The recommended maximum daily dose of loperamide is 16 
mg/day.  
o Continuation of loperamide is suggested un til diarrhea -free for 12 hours . 
o If mild to moderate diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, administer loperamide 
2 mg every 2 hours and pursue evaluation for other treatable causes.  
o If mild to moderate diarrhea persists after 48 hours total treatment wi th loperamide, 
discontinue study drug(s) and consider initiation of second -line agents (lomotil, 
octreotide).  
 
Complicated diarrhea of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 or Grade 1 or 2 with complicating 
features requires aggressive management:  
 Subject  must call study sit e physician immediately in response to  any event of severe 
diarrhea with or without complications as listed above.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153101] -threatening 
complications.  
 Interrupt  investigational pro ducts until sympt oms resolve;  consider reintroducing at a 
reduced dose  (discuss with Vector Oncology ). 
 If loperamide has not been initiated, begin  loperamide usage immed iately at an i nitial 
dose of 4 mg followed by 2 mg every 2 hours or after every unformed stool . The 
recommended maximum daily dose of loperamide is 16 mg/day.  
 If no improvement in severity after [ADDRESS_1267231] visit study site and be evaluated:

 o For dehydration , use in travenous fluids as appropriate.   
 Antibiotic therapy s hould be considered in patients who present with signs and 
symptoms of bacterial diarrhea such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and presence of fecal 
leukocytes. Investigators should have a low threshold to start such treatment in patients 
with Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia.  
 Before initiation of antimicrobial therapy, stool cultures should be obtained. When 
bacterial etiology for diarrhea is suspected, study -treatment and anti -motility agents 
(loperamide or others) should be held.  
 Intervention should be continu ed until diarrhea free for 24 hours . 
 
Alternative Pharmacologic Intervention for Uncomplicated and Complicated Diarrhea  
 Lomotil (di phenoxylate 2.5 mg + atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 0.025 mg) can be used. The recommended 
dose is 2 tablets 4 times daily. When diarrhea is under control, a dose reduction should 
be attempted.  
The synthetic octape ptide, octreotide, has been shown  to be effective in the co ntrol of 
diarrhea induced by [CONTACT_903458] -based chemotherapy regimens when administered as 
an escalating dose by [CONTACT_903459].  Octreotide can be 
administered at doses ranging from 100 g twice daily to 500 g 3 times daily, with a 
maximum -tolerated dose of 2000 g [ADDRESS_1267232] anti -nausea/anti -emetic therapy as necessary.  
If a s ubject vomits after taking study medication, the subject should be instructed not to take 
a replacement dose on that same day.  The subject should resume taking pazopanib at the 
next scheduled dose on the following day.  If vomiting persists then the subje ct should 
contact [CONTACT_9682].  
To prevent or treat nausea and vomiting standard medications are recommended.  These may 
include:  
 5-HT [ADDRESS_1267233] (granisetron, ondansetron, dolasetron mesylate);  
 NK-1 receptor antagonists such as aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053],  metoclopramide,  phenothiazines 
(prochlorperazine);  
 corticosteroids, (dexamethasones, prednisone); and

  cannabinoids  (dronabinol).  
Wound Healing  
No formal studies on the effect of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted.  Since 
vascular endothelia l growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as pazopanib may  
impair wound healing, treatment with pazopanib should be stopped at least 7 days prior to  
scheduled surgery.  The decision to resume pazopanib after surgery should be based on 
clinical  judgm ent of adequate wound healing. Pazopanib should be discontinued in subjects 
with wound dehiscence.  
Overdose  
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the dose escalation study of pazopanib 
administered as a single agent at repeated doses of up to 2000  mg/day (Study VEG10003).  
Systemic exposure to pazopanib at steady -state appeared to plateau at doses greater than [ADDRESS_1267234] promptly report any overdose to Vector Oncology  as an important 
medical event (see SAE Section 10.2.3 ).  Decisions regarding pazopanib dose modifications 
or interruptions will be made by [CONTACT_903460] o f the subject.    
Following an overdose, additional monitoring of the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory 
abnormalities should be considered.   
Information regarding the quantity of the excess dose, as well as the duration of overdosing, 
should be document ed in the source documents and in the iCRF.  
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome / Reversible Posterior 
Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome  
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) / Reversible Posterior 
Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been reported in patients receiving pazopanib 
and may be fatal.  PRES/ RPLS is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, 
seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances.  Mild to 
severe hypertension may b e present.  The diagnosis of PRES/ RPLS is optimally confirmed

meets the criterion of total bilirubin > 1.[ADDRESS_1267239] dose interruptions/modifications in case of liver -
related treatment -emergent AEs are provided in Table 7.  As a general rule, since many 
subjects are taking mu ltiple concurrent medications, it is critical to (a) do a thorough 
evaluation of the subject’s concurrent medications, and (b) identify and discontinue those 
with known hepatotoxicity and replace with a non -hepatotoxic equivalent for the same 
indication if  necessary.  Details on the subject’s alcohol use will be captured in the iCRF.   
Liver dysfunction must be fully evaluated even if clinical signs and symptoms indicate 
progression of liver tumor lesions.  Imaging studies must be obtained to document 
progre ssion of malignancy.

 6.5. Prohibited and Permitted Medications  During Study  Treatment  
6.5.1.  Prohibited Medications  
Subjects should not receive other anti -cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or 
hormonal) while  on treatment in this study.   When pazopanib 800 mg was administered with 
lapatinib 1500 mg, the pazopanib AUC and  Cmax increased approximately 50% to 60% 
compared with taking pazopanib alone.  Clinical trials of pazopanib in combination with 
pemetrexed (NSCLC) and lapatinib  (cervical cancer)  were terminated early due to concerns 
over increased toxicity and/or mortality, and a safe and effective combination dose has not 
been established with these regimens.  Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combination  with 
other agents.  
Subjects should avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while receiving  treatment in this 
study.   Plasma pazopanib concentrations may be elevated, increasing the pharmacologic 
effects and risk of adverse reactions.  
Medications that inhibi t CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma pazopanib concentrations , 
increasing the pharmacologic effects and risk of adverse reactions.  T herefore, co -
administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is PROHIBITED beginning [ADDRESS_1267254] dose of study  drug until  discontinuation from the study  treatment .  Strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors  include (but are not limited to) : 
 Antibiotics : clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin  
 HIV: protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir,  
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] , atazanavir ) 
 Antifungals :  itraconazole , ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole  
 Antidepressants :  nefazodone  
Medications that inhibit permeability glycoprotein (P -gp) may result in increased plasma 
pazopanib concentrations, increasing the pharm acologic effects and risk of adverse reactions.  
Therefore , concomitant administration of strong P-gp inhibitors is PROHIBITED  beginning 
[ADDRESS_1267255] dose of study drug until discontinuation from the study treatment .  
Strong P -gp inhibitors i nclude (but are not limited to):  
 Antiarrhythmics : amiodarone, dronedarone, quinidine , verapamil  
 Antibiotics : clarithromycin  
 Antifungals :  itraconazole , ketoconazole  
 Immune modulators : cyclosporine, tacrolimus  
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267256] dose of pazopanib and until end of treatment 
blood draws are completed.  
6.5.2.  Permitted Medications  – Use with Caution  
Although acetaminophen at doses of  2 g/day is permitted,  it should be used with 
caution in subjects with impaired liver function.  
Specific recommendations regarding the use of simvas tatin and other statins:  
Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin (Zocor) increases the risk of ALT elevations 
and should be u ndertaken with caution and close monitoring.  If a subject receiving 
concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow the Guidelines for Management of 
Treatment Emergent Hepatotoxicity and discontinue simvastatin.  Insufficient  data are 
available to  assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and 
pazopanib.  
Specific recommendations regarding drugs  that raise  gastric pH:  
In a drug interaction trial in patients with solid tumors, concomitant administration of 
pazopanib with eso meprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), decreased the exposure of 
pazopanib by [CONTACT_3450] 40% (AUC and C max).  Therefore, concomitant use of pazopanib 
with drugs  that raise  gastric pH should be avoided .  If such drugs are needed, short -acting 
antacids  should be considered in place of PPIs and H [ADDRESS_1267257] 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short -acting 
antacids.  
Specific recommendations regarding anticoagulants:  
Results from drug -drug interaction studies conducted in subjects with cancer suggest that 
pazopanib has no effect on the metabolism of S -warfarin.  Hemorrhagic events, however, 
have been reported in clinical studies with pazopanib; therefore, pazopanib  should be used 
with cauti on in subjects with increased risk of severe bleeding or who are receiving 
concomitant anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin or its derivatives, low molecular weight 
heparin, unfractionated heparin) .  Subjects taking concomitant anticoagulant therapy shoul d 
be monitored regularly for changes in relevant coagulation parameters as clinically indicated, 
as well as for any clinical bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
Specific recommendations regarding hypoglycemic therapy including insulin:  
Results from drug -drug interaction st udies conducted in subjects with cancer suggest that 
there will be no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between pazopanib and 
hypoglycemic agents.  Transient decreases in serum glucose (mainly Grade 1 and 2, rarely 
Grade 3) have been observed  in clinical studies with pazopanib.  In addition, decreases in 
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267258] been recently reported in subjects treated with another small molecule 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib [Billemont, 2008 ].  Such changes may require an 
adjustment in the d ose of hypoglycemic and/or insulin therapy.  Subjects should be advised 
to report symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., confusion, visual disturbances, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
sweating).  Serum glucose should be tested during treatment with pazopanib as outlined in 
the pr otocol and as clinically indicated.  
The Effects of Pazopanib on Other Drugs  
In vitro  data indicate that pazopanib is a potential inhibitor for CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1.  Pregnane X receptor 
transient trans fection assay suggested some potential for human CYP3A4 induction at high 
concentrations.  Results from drug -drug interaction studies conducted in subjects with cancer 
suggest that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 in vivo , but 
had no clinically relevant effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 metabolism .  Therefore, 
concomitant use of pazopanib with certain medications (substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, 
and CYP2D6) with a narrow therapeutic window should be undertaken with CAUTION due 
to the potential for alterations in the pharmacologic effects of these medications or an 
increased risk for serious or life threatening adverse events associated with such medications 
(see below) secondary to the inhibition of specific CYP enzymes by [CONTACT_903461] b.  In addition, 
the potential for drug interaction with such medications, although diminished, may persist 
after the last dose of pazopanib due to its long half -life (i.e., mean 30.9 hours); therefore, 
continue to exercise CAUTION  for at least [ADDRESS_1267259] dose of 
pazopanib when administering these medications.  These medications include (but are not 
limited to):  
 Ergot derivatives :  dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine 
(potential increased risk for developi [INVESTIGATOR_153076])  
 Neuroleptics : pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924] (potential increased risk for QT interval prolongation, 
ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death)  
 Antiarrhythmics : bepridil, flecain ide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone (potential 
increased risk for QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes)  
 Immune modulators : sirolimus (potential increased risk for nephrotoxicity and 
neurotoxicity)  
 Miscellaneous : quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, cloz api[INVESTIGATOR_050], atomoxetine.  
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267260] that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human 
liver microsomes is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 
and CYP2C8.  Furthermore, in vitro data sugges t that pazopanib is a substrate for p -
glycoprotein.  Substances that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter the pharmacologic effects 
of pazopanib and should be used with CAUTION .   
Medications that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma pazopanib conce ntrations , 
increasing the pharmacologic effects and risk of adverse reactions .  Co-administration of 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited (see Section 6.5.1  Prohibited Medications ); therefore , 
select ion of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit 
CYP3A4 is recommended.  
Medications that inhibit P -gp may result in increased plasma pazopanib concentrations, 
increasing the pharmacologic effects and risk of adverse react ions.   Co-administration of 
strong P -gp inhibitors is prohibited (see Section 6.5.1  Prohibited Medications ); therefore, 
selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp 
is recommended.  
CYP3A4 inducers may reduce plasma pazopanib concentrations , decreasing the efficacy .  
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction 
potential is recommended.  Pazopanib should not be given  to patients who cannot avoid long -
term use of strong CYP3A4 inducers.  Drugs that induce CYP3A4 and may decrease 
pazopanib plasma concentrations include (but are not limited to) : 
 Glucocorticoids :  cortisone (>50 mg), hydrocortisone (>40 mg), prednisone (> 10 mg), 
methylprednisolone (>8 mg), dexamethasone (>1.5 mg)  
 Anticonvulsants :  phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , phenobarbital, oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
 HIV antivirals :  efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
 Antibiotics :  rifampin (rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]), rifabutin, rifapent ine 
 Miscellaneous:   St. John ’s Wort, modafinil, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], troglitazone

verifies any measurement that is not normal, and takes appropriate a ction.  
7.1. Screening Assessments  
A signed, written informed consent form must be obtained from the subject prior to any 
study -specific procedures or assessments.  Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s 
routine clinical management (e.g., blood count, ima ging study) and obtained prior to signing 
of informed consent may be utilized for Screening purposes provided these procedures are 
conducted as specified in the protocol.  The study assessment schedules and visit windows 
are summarized in the Time and Even ts Schedule (Appendix 1). 
Screening assessments must  be conducted within the specified time frame  prior to start of 
protocol therapy  and will include the following:   
 obtain written informed consent  within 28 days  prior to start of protocol therapy ; 
 record  demographics and medical and disease history within 28 days  prior to start of 
protocol therapy .  (Disease history must include date of diagnosis, prior treatment [ i.e., 
chemotherapy, surger y, radiotherapy], and if applicable sites of metastases.  Medical

the Cycle 1 Day 1 physical exam is not required .); 
Note :  At the Screening  visit, blood pressure should be measured three times at 
approximately [ADDRESS_1267262]’s blood pressure is within 
the well -controlled range; or if the subject needs medical attention.  
At all later visits, a single blood pressure is measure d. If both the systolic and the 
diastolic blood pressure is within the well - controlled range (defined as blood 
pressure below 140/90 mmHg) this value is recorded on the iCRF. If either the 
systolic or the diastolic pressure is outside the well -controlled range, three blood 
pressures are measured as described for the Screening  visit and the mean blood

7.2. Efficacy Assessments  
Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST guidelines version 1.1 .  Subjects  will be 
staged for response after every 2 cycles  of treatment  at the end of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. 
(approximately every 8 weeks) .  Imaging should be conducted at the end of the indic ated 
cycle s or prior to treatment on Day 1 of the next cycle (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.) taking into account 
time required for receipt and review of scan results.   
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267267] or PET/CT and any other appropriate 
imaging s tudies .  Contrast should be used for all scans unless contraindicated .  Confirmation 
of PR or CR is required by [CONTACT_903463] [ADDRESS_1267268] met.  EOT tumor assessments should be made within  30 days of 
study treatment discontinuation.   Subjects  may continue study treatment in the absence of 
disease progres sion or unacceptable toxicity.     
7.2.1.  Tumor Measurement  
The procedures for solid tumor measurement are as follows:  
 Measurable disease:  the pre sence of at least one measurable lesion.  If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 Measurable lesions : lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(the longest diameter), and with a minimum size of [ADDRESS_1267269] X -ray. 
o A malignant lymph node may be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable if it is  [ADDRESS_1267270] or MRI, may be considered as measurable lesion if the 
soft tissue component meets the criteria for measurable lesions.  
o Cystic metasta ses may be considered as measurable lesions if they meet the 
criteria for measurable lesions, however, non -cystic lesions, if present, are 
preferred as target lesions.  
o Tumor lesions in an area previously subjected to loco -regional treatment, may be 
conside red measurable if there has been demonstrated progression.  
 Non-measurable lesions : all other lesions, including simple cysts, small lesions (longest 
diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with  10 to <  15 mm short axis) and 
other truly non -measurab le lesions. These include: leptomeningeal disease; ascites; 
pleural/pericardial effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis; 
abdominal masses that are not measurable by [CONTACT_128694]; blastic 
bone lesions.  
All meas urements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All Baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_1267271] of a treatment.

 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e .g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) , and > [ADDRESS_1267272] slice 
thickness is < 5 mm.   
7.2.2.  Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -target Lesions  
 When more than one measurable lesion is present at Baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representativ e 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured 
at Baseline.  
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurement s (either by [CONTACT_13458]).  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for 
all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the Baseline sum diameters. The 
Baseline sum diameters will be us ed as reference to further characterize any objective 
tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be reco rded at Baseline. Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’ ‘absent’, or in rare 
cases ‘unequivocal progression’. Multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ 
may be recorded as a single item.  
7.2.3.  Response Criteria  
Response and progression will be evalua ted in this study using RECIST guidelines version 
1.1 [Eisenhauer, 2009 ].

 Table 9. Respons e Criteria for Target Lesions  
Response Category  Criteria  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathological lymph nodes 
must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of  diameters of the target lesions 
taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study, and an absolute increase 
of at least 5  mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.  
Stable  Disease  (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum diameters while 
on th e study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
The criteria for evaluating non -target lesions are summarized in Table 9. 
Table 10. Response Criteria for Non -target Lesions  
Response Category  Criteria  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearanc e of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological (<  10 mm 
short axis).  
Non-complete Response  
(non-CR)/Non -progression 
(non-PD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenanc e 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal appearance of one or more new malignant lesions. 
Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. Although a 
clear progression of non -target lesions only is exce ptional, in such 
circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_903441] a review

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as referen ce for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the subject ’s best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

a ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is increasingly 
used as endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions 
can be measured is not advised.  
 
 When nodal disease is included in th e sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
‘normal’ size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  
 Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort sho uld be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determinat ion, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before 
confirming the complete response status. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to 
a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiog raphic abnormality 
is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  
 For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Confirmation  
 In non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or 
CR must be  confirmed by [CONTACT_903464] 
[ADDRESS_1267276] met.  
 In randomized trials or studies where the primary endpoints are stable disease or 
progression, confirmation of response is not re quired. Elimination of the requirement for 
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267277] 
bias, particularly in studies which are not blinded.  
 In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 -8 weeks.  
7.3. Safety Assessments  
The definitions for an AE and SAE and the procedures for collecting and reporting these 
events are provided in Section  10.  Toxicities  will be graded using the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0) (see  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). 
7.3.1.  Laboratory Tests  During Treatment  
Laboratory tests will be performed as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule ( Appendix 
1).  
Participating sites will use their local laboratory to perform all clinical laboratory 
assessments.  Laboratory tests will be performed during Screening, at specified visits during 
study  treatment , and at the end of treatment visit, all as sp ecified in the Time and Events 
Schedule.  Laboratory assessments may be performed within 3 business days before the 
actual visit to allow flexibility in scheduling.   These a ssessments may be performed more 
frequently if clinically indicated.  
Hematology and  Chemistry  
A complete blood count (CBC) with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), 
phosphorus, and magnesium will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle (approximately every 4 
weeks) .  
A separate liver function test (LFT) panel will be assessed on Day [ADDRESS_1267278], and bilirubin.  
Full Panel Liver Function Tests  for Treatment Emergent Hepatotoxicity  
When full panel LFTs are conducted  due to treatment emergent hepatotoxicity , this panel 
should include  the following: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and total bilirubin.  A 
direct bilirubin level should be obtained if the total bilirubin level is greater than 1.5 x upper 
limit of normal (ULN).  Coagulation tests should be performed as clinically indi cated.  Liver

 Evaluation of Protei n 
Proteinuria will be evaluated using the urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPC) as described in 
Appendix 4.  UPC will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle (approximately every 4 weeks) .   
If UPC > 3, then the dose modification table guidelines should be fo llowed (see Section 
6.3.1 , Table 7). 
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone  
Thyroid function tests to assess thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) will be assessed  after the 
first 2 cycles of treatment and then after  every 4 cycles  of treatment on Day 1 of Cycles 3,  7, 
11, 15,  etc. (approximately every 16 weeks).  
Lipase  
Lipase will be assessed after the first  2 cycles of treatment and then after every 4 cycle s of 
treatment on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 7, 11, 15, etc. (approx imately every 16 weeks).  
7.3.2.  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations will be performed  on Day 1 of each cycle (approximately every 4 
weeks) .  If Screening physical exam is performed within [ADDRESS_1267279], heart, abdomen, skin, and nodes (cervical, 
axillary, inguinal) with other areas exami ned as clinically indicated.  
7.3.3.  Vital Signs , Weight, and Performance Status  
Vital signs, weight, and ECOG performance status will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle 
(approximately every 4 weeks) .  Vital sign measurements will include pulse, te mperature, 
and b lood pressure.  For ECOG performance status, refer to  Appendix [ADDRESS_1267280] be monitored weekly during Cycle 1 
and every 2 weeks during Cycles 2 and 3.  Note that only a BP measurement is  required at 
Cycle 1 Day 8 (+/ - 1 business day), Cycle 1 Day 15 (+/ - 1 business day), Cycle 1 Day 22 (+/ - 
1 business day), Cycle 2 Day 15 (+/ - 1 business day), and Cycle 3 Day 15 (+/ - 1 business 
day).  Other vital signs are not required at these time points, and BP can be assessed by [CONTACT_903465] (e.g., at home or by [CONTACT_20427]) as long as the Investigator is informed of the 
measurement, verifies any measurement that is not normal, and t akes appropriate action.   
After Cycle 3, if BP is controlled  (defined as blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg) , then BP 
may be monitored once monthly.  After Cycle 3, if BP is uncontrolled  (defined as blood

Sitting blood pressure should be measured after the subject has been sitting quietly for at 
least [ADDRESS_1267282]’s blood pressure is within t he well -controlled range; or if the subject 
needs medical attention.   
At all later visits, a single blood pressure is measured.  If both the systolic and the diastolic 
blood pressure is within the well -controlled range (defined as blood pressure below 140 /90 
mmHg) this value is recorded on the iCRF.  If either the systolic or the diastolic pressure is 
outside the well -controlled range, three blood pressures are measured as described for the 
Screening  visit and the mean blood pressure values are entered on the iCRF and used to 
determine if the subject needs medical attention. Refer to Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_1267283] s at the end of Cycle 1, and then after every 4 cycles of 
treatment at the end of Cycles 5, 9, 13, 17, etc. (approximately every 16 weeks) .  EKGs may 
be performed before the start of treatment on Day [ADDRESS_1267284] be measured using the Bazett’s formula and the result documented .  Additional 
EKGs should be done at the Investigator’s discretion to ensure the subject’s safety , and in 
case the subject experiences a non -study drug treatment modification with a potentially QT

[CONTACT_903466].  If the  average  QTc 
is ≤ [ADDRESS_1267291] may continue therapy.   
If the average  QTc is > [ADDRESS_1267292] be taken:  
 Study treatment must  be interrupted immediately.  
 Electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, must  be checked and corrected if 
abnormal.  
 Concomitant medications with a potential for QTc interval prolongation must  be 
discontinued if clinically appropriate.  
 The subject must  be treated appropriately for QTc prolongation and monitored until 
resolut ion is documented by a repeat EK G with QTc interval returning to ≤  480 msec.  
 Communicate findings to Vector Oncology . 
NOTE : If the QTc prolongation > 500 msec is clearly and causally associated with an 
underlying situation that is clearly reversible (e.g., a subject with severe diarrhea an d 
hypokalemia with QTc prolongation that resolves once the diarrhea improves and potassium 
is corrected), then the subject may restart study drug once the underlying situation has been 
corrected (e.g., electrolytes supplemented), the QTc interval prolongat ion has resolved, and a 
discussion with Vector Oncology has taken place.

the frequency of on -study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in the study.  
o The Investigator must immediately notify Vector Oncology  in the event of a 
confirmed pregnancy in a subject participating in the study.  
 The subject uses illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise interfering 
with results.  
 The development of a second malignancy that requires treatment, whic h would interfere 
with this study.  
 The subject is lost to Follow -up. 
 Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, affect assessments of clinical status and study endpoints to a significant 
degree.  
8.2. Criteria for Removal from Study  
Subjects will be removed from study treatment when any of the criteria listed in Section 8.[ADDRESS_1267296]’s source documents and in the iCRF . 
8.3. Procedures for End of Treatment and Follow -up 
The Investigator will make every reasonable effort to keep each subject in the study unless it 
is in the subject’s best interests to discontinue participation.  If a subject is remove d from 
treatment  or declines further participation, all End of Treatment evaluations should be 
performed if the subject is willing and able to be assessed (see Appendix 1 for the Time and 
Events Schedule).  The End of Treatment evaluations must be performe d within [ADDRESS_1267297] discontinuing study treatment.  A description of the reason(s) for discontinuation  
from the study treatment must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the 
iCRF.  
Relevant visit data should be entered in the iCRF and any unused study medication will be 
accounted for and returned for all subjects participating in the study, even for a brief period 
of time.   
In general, as far as pazopanib is concerned, subjects should not receive any other 
investigational drug wi thin [ADDRESS_1267298] should die during the trial or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262], the 
Investigator will inform Vector Oncology  as soon as possible.  Th e cause of death should be 
recorded in detail on the SAE Report  Form. 
After the end of treatment (whatever the reason for discontinuation), the subject will be 
followed for at least [ADDRESS_1267299]’s source documents . 
All subjects who discontinue treatment secondary to an AE should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization or return to a Baseline condition.  Subjects who discontinue 
treatment without documented tumor progression should be evaluated for extent of disease at 
the time of treatment discontinuation.  
Subjects will be in long -term Follow -up for [ADDRESS_1267300]’s source documents .  Subjects 
who discontinue treatment due to disease progression will have Follow -ups conducted every 
[ADDRESS_1267301] Follow -ups conducted every 3 mo nths to assess 
disease status.  During Follow -up, repeat imaging should be performed per the treating 
Investigator’s discretion, and assessment of the su bject’s disease status should be based upon 
the most current information available at the time the Follow -up is due.  Once the subject has 
experienced disease progression, (s)he will be follo wed every 3 months for survival for six 
months. . 
The Investigator  should ensure that all subjects are followed for disease status (as applicable) 
and survival status every [ADDRESS_1267302] a child -
resistant closure. The study drug should be administrated and stored according to the 
instructions specified on the drug labels (refer to label, P I, and IB for detailed information).  
 
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267303] ration  
Administration of pazopanib with a high -fat or low -fat meal results in an approximately 2 -
fold increase in area under the plasma drug concentration curve (AUC) and maximum 
observed plasma drug concentration (C max). 
Pazopanib should be taken orally w ithout food at least one hour before or two hours after a 
meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole and must not be crushed or broken. The time of 
day the tablets are taken should be relatively cons istent .

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal 
and that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable 
regulati ons, guidelines, and institutional procedures.  Appropriate records of the disposal 
must be maintained.  
10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Toxicities will be recorded as AEs in the subject ’s source documents and on the Adverse 
Event iCRF and must be graded using t he CTCAE v 4.0. 
10.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have to have a

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
- 68 - 
 causal relationship with this treatment.  An  AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of  pazopanib  whether or not considered related to pazopanib . 
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., EKGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from B aseline, and are felt to be clinically s ignificant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator.  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication.  
 
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless  judged by [CONTACT_152889]’s condition.  
 The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subjec t’s 
condition.  
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads 
to the procedure is an AE.  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated  day-to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
During clinical trials, AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evalu ation of a subject.  (In order to prevent reporting bias, 
subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined by [CONTACT_98755] a significant hazard or s ide 
effect, regardless of the Investigator or Sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_903444]1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267306].  This includes, but may not be limited to, any event that (at any 
dose):  
 Is fatal.  
 Is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death).  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
(Note that complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_903445].)  
 Is a persis tent or significant disability/incapacity.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 All liver chemistry abnormalities meeting pre -defined criteria  must be reported as SAEs.  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356911] “serious” criteria is any  
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37350] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health 
care facility.  
 Any event that does not exactly meet this definition yet, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_903446] a significant hazard can be assigned the “other signifi cant hazard” regulatory 
reporting serious criteria.  
 Additionally, important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_903447], or result in urgent 
investigation, may be considered serious.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, 
convulsions, and blood dyscrasias.  For reporting purposes, also consider the 
occurrences of pregnancy or overdose (regardless of adverse outcome) as events 
which must be reported as important medical events.  
 An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease 
progression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the 
underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expec ted for the subject, 
or if the I nvestigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment 
with investigational product or protocol design/procedures and the disease prog ression, 
then this must be reported as an SAE.  
10.2. Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events  
10.2.1.   All Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring after the start of study  treatment  observed by [CONTACT_714232] (whether or not attributed to pazopanib ), will be reported on the iCRF.   
Medically significant AEs considered related to the investigational product by [CONTACT_903467].  The 
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267307] assign the following attributes:  description; dates of onset and resolution; 
severity; assessment of relatedness to investigational product, and action taken.  The 
Investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information.  
If any subject should die during the trial or within 30 days of s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_262], the 
Investigator will inform Vector Oncology  as soon as possible.  The cause of death should be 
recorded in detail on the SAE Report  Form. 
Vector Oncology  will notify the central IRB of IND Safety reports received from [COMPANY_001] , if 
applicable .  The site will be responsible for reporting SAEs occurring at the site to the 
applicable IRB per the IRB’s reporting guidelines .  Sites that are required to utilize a local 
IRB will be responsible for their own local IRB submissions.   
It will  be left to th e Investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment.  A subject may also voluntarily 
discontinue  treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE.  If  either of these 
occurs, the subject must undergo an end -of-treatment visit and be given appropriate care 
under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable and returns 
for a safety Follow -up visit.  If the subject was permanent ly removed  from the study or 
investigational product due to an SAE, this information must be included in either the initial 
or follow -up SAE Report Form and in the End of Treatment iCRF.  
10.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The following categories and definitions o f causal relationship to study drug should be 
considered:  
 Certain : There is a known causal relationship between the study drug and the AE/SAE.  
The event responds to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge), and recurs with 
rechallenge when clinically feasib le. (>95% certainty  of relatedness ). 
 Probable : There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
AE/SAE.  The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required. (65% -95% 
probability  of relatedness ). 
 Possible : There is reasonab le causal relationship between the study drug and the  AE/ 
SAE.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear. (35% -65% probability of 
relatedness).  
 Not likely : There is temporal relationship to study drug administration, but there is not a 
reasonable caus al relationship between the study drug and the AE/SAE. (5 -35% 
probability of relatedness).  
 Not related : There is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration (too early, 
or late, or study drug not taken), or there is known causal relationship b etween the 
AE/SAE and another drug, concurrent disease, or other circumstance. (<5% chance of 
relatedness).

Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be in accordance not only with the [LOCATION_003] FDA requirements 
but also with the European Directive 2001/20/EC and Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 
1031.  S[LOCATION_003]R reporting will be handled by [CONTACT_4885].  
 Collection of comp lete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Full 
descriptions of each event will be followed by [CONTACT_5343] . Thus, follow -up information 
which becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_903448]), should be collected subsequently, if 
not available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the same 
procedure as the initial SAE report.  
 AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, and reported  as SAEs if they 
become serious. This also applies to subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug , or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of 
their participation in study  treatment ; such subjects should receive post -treatment 
follow -up as appropriate.  
 
11. STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY  
11.1. Introduction  
Descriptive statistics will be generated for all study variables.  These will include means, 
standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum values for continuous vari ables; and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables; and survival function graphs for 
description of time to event endpoints.  Other details regarding analyses are presented below, 
under Statistical Analysis.  
11.2. Analysis Populations  
There is no rand omization in this study.  Intent to treat is defined as occurring at first 
administration of Pazopanib on C1D1 to eligible subject s, regardless of subsequent subject  
discontinuation .  The intent to treat population includes all subject s who receive the fir st 
administration of Pazopanib on C1D1.  
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267323] evaluation 
of disease control.  
11.3. Endpo ints 
11.3.1.  Primary  
The primary endpoint is disease control at week 16 . defined as CR + PR + SD , where tumor 
response is defined by [CONTACT_903456] 1.1.  
The analy sis sample for primary endpoint  of the study is the intent to treat population.  
Subjects w ho are not evaluable for disease control rate  will be considered treatment failures 
for this endpoint.  
11.3.2.  Secondary  
The secondary endpoints of this study are as follows:  
 Progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST guidelines version 1.1 . 
 Overall survi val (OS).  
 Toxicity assessment through t he reporting of adverse events graded using t he CTCAE 
v4.0. 
The analysis sample for secondary endpoints of the study is the intent to treat population.    
11.4. Sample Size  
The primary endpoint for this study is disease cont rol at week 16 defined as CR + PR + SD , 
where tumor response is defined  by [CONTACT_903456] 1.1.  For sample size 
estimation, we assume a null hypothesis rate of 30%, and an alternative hypothesis rate of 
50%.  A sample of 47 subjects will provide  power of 80% to detect this effect, with alpha = 
.05, two tailed.  
There will be no randomization in this study.  
Investigator -specific bias will be minimized through the use of multiple centers.   
11.5. Statistical Analysis  
11.5.1.  Baseline Demographic and Clinical Char acteristics  
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize Baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics of study subject s.  As above, these will include means, standard deviations, 
medians, minimum and maximum values for continuous variables; and  frequency and 
percentage for categorical variables .  The disposition of subject s at end of treatment  will be

the null hypothesis rate of 30%.   Change from Baseline in sum of la rgest diameters of target 
lesions as of week [ADDRESS_1267325] or Fisher’s Exact test 
may be used to compare disease control rate  across tumor grade.  Log rank tests will  be used 
to compare time to event endpoints across tumor grades .   Logistic regression may be used to 
examine disease control by [CONTACT_903469], controlling for other subject  characteristics.  
Other exploratory analyses may be conducted as indicated by [CONTACT_903470].  
Protocol AAPSMCS1002   Version January 28, [ADDRESS_1267326] written and dated 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_30757]  (IRB) for the final protocol, 
informed consent , subject  recruitment materials/process ( e.g., advertisements), and any other 
written information to be provided to subject s.  Documentation of approval signed by [CONTACT_903471](s) must  be sent to Vector Oncology . 
Vector Oncology will provide the central IRB with reports, updates, and other information 
(e.g., Safety Updates, Amendments, Administrative Letters) according to regulatory 
requirements and institution procedures.  Sites that are required to utilize a local IRB will be 
responsible for their own local IRB submissions.  The protocol must be re -approved by [CONTACT_4001], as local regulations require.  
Progress reports and notifications of serious unexpected ADRs will be provided to the IRB 
according to local regulations and guidelines.  Vector Oncology will provi de the central IRB 
with reports of any serious ADRs from any other study conducted with the investigational 
product.   
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles tha t have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH GCP, applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
12.3. Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions  
The study must be conducted as described in the final approved protocol.   
All revis ions will be submitted to [COMPANY_001]  by [CONTACT_903472] .  The Investigator should not 
implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_195705], except where necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subject s. 
See also 21Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for definitions of amendment and 
requirements.  
12.4. Informed Consent  
Preparation of the consent form is the responsibility of Vector Oncology  and will include all 
elem ents required by [ADDRESS_1267327]  or his/h er legally acceptable representative is 
given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk 
and benefit, and other critical issues regarding clinical trials of the study.  Subjects must also 
be notified that they a re free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The subject should be 
given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided.  
The subject’s signed and dated informed consent(s) must be obtained before conducting an y 
procedure specifically for the study.  The Investigator(s) must store the original, signed 
written Informed Consent Form(s).  A copy of the signed written Informed Consent Form(s) 
must be given to the subject.  
12.5. Records and Reports  
An Investigator is requi red to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation (e .g., iCRF) 
on each individual treated with the study drug or entered in the investigation.  The 
Investigato r is required to retain, in a confidential manner, the data pertinent to the study.  
12.6. Subject Data Protection  
In accordance with HIPAA, the written Informed Consent Form must include a subject 
authorization to release medical information to Vector Oncology  and/or allow Vector 
Oncology , a regulatory authority, or IRB access to subject’s medical information that 
includes all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44227], including a subject’s medical history.  
12.7. Records Retention  
The Investigator must retain study drug d isposition records, source documents, and case 
histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation (e .g., 
iCRF) for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_8666], or 
Institution procedures.  
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another Investigator, IRB).  
Documentation of such transfer will be provided to [COMPANY_001]  by [CONTACT_903472] .

- 86 - Appendix  4 Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio (UPC)  
Clinical Meaning of UPC  
There is a good correlation between the ratio of protein concentration to creatinine 
concentration in a random urine sample and the amount of protein exc reted over 24 hours.  
Creatinine excretion is fairly constant throughout the day regardless of changes in urine flow 
rate.  Men excrete 20 mg to 25 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day.   Women excrete 15 
mg to 20 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day.   Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 
150 mg/24 hours and is similar for men and women.  
Calculating UPC  
UPC ratio = Urine protein (mg/dL) / Urine creatinine (mg/dL).  
UPC ratio ≈ equivalent to grams of protein excreted in urine over 24 hrs.  
Example:   Subject  has a urine protein = 90 mg/dL and urine creatinine = 30 mg/dL.   
UPC ratio= (90 mg/dL) / (30 mg/dL) =  3   
The calculated UPC ratio is 3, which correlates to roughly 3 g pr otein excretion in a 24 -
hour period.  
Units for UPC ration  
Note:  To calculate UPC, protein and creatinine concentrations must be expressed in the same 
units (mg/dL, g/L, or μmol/L).   If, for example, protein concentration is expressed in mg/dL 
and creatinin e concentration is expressed in µmol/L, conversion of one of the concentration 
values is required.  Conversion factors are:  
From  To  Conversion Factor  
Conventional Units: mg/dL  SI Units: µmol/L  Multiply by 88.4  
SI Units: µmol/L  Conventional  Units:  mg/dL Divide 88.4

The following table presents the NYHA Classification of Cardiac Disease:  
 
Class  Functional Capacity  Objective Assessment  
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting 
limitations of physical activity.  Ordinary phy sical 
activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], 
dyspnea, or anginal pain.  No objective evidence of 
cardiovascular disease.  
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation 
of physical activity.  They are comfortable at rest.  
Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], 
dyspnea, or anginal pain.  Objective evidence of minimal 
cardiovascular disease.  
 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked 
limitation of physical activity.  They are comfortable at 
rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain.  Objective evidence of 
moderately severe 
cardiovascular disease.  
 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to 
carry on any physical activity without discomfo rt.  
Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may 
be present even at rest.  If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort is increased.  Objective evidence of severe 
cardiovascular disease.

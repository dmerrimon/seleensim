  Version 6.0 08/ 27/[ADDRESS_465128] injury (SCI) occurs suddenly and unexpectedly to an estimated 12,500 people each year, and over 
275,000  people  are thought to be living with SCI in the [LOCATION_002] alone. [1] Restoration of walking is cited as 
a priority among persons with SCI, regardless of severity, chronicity, or age at injury. [2] To address this priority , 
numerous approaches have been implemented to restore locomotor function either through physical training  [3] 
and/or through the use of rehabilitation  technology. [4] High-tech approaches to improving function after SCI are  
exciting  and receive much media attention; h owever, a recent systematic  review found that, of the many 
interventions aimed at improving  motor function , the strongest evidence support s those strategies that include a 
physica l training  component. [5] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_58009], current rehabilitation strategies aimed at the 
restoration of walking functio n often require  access to intensive training  programs conducted over extended 
period s of time  and to facilities and equipment that may not be available in the homes or communities in which 
individuals with SCI live. Therefore , it would seem that the key s to optimizing long-term recovery  of function are 
to identify those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371794] i dentify 
training approaches that are readily accessible  in the home environment. These considerations , along with t hree 
important findings in the research, form the basis of this project.   
 
First, evidence from a large multi -million dol lar locomotor training study involving persons with stroke found that 
a wel l-designed exercise program can be as effective for improving walking  function as an intensive locomotor 
training program. [6] Second, a single session of moderate -intensity exercise has been found to  promote  motor  
skill acquisition, presumably through  neurotrophic mechanisms , and to reduce spasticity .[7-9] In persons with 
SCI, 10 minutes of moderate -intensity activity (54% of maximal heart rate) was associated with a 1.5 -fold 
increase in serum levels of neurotrophic factor. [7] Studies investigating  locomotor training in persons with SCI 
[10] and in spi[INVESTIGATOR_371795] [11], 
which may affect  the extent and severity of spasticity. [9] Third, supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_371796], yet studies aimed at improving walking function have focused almost exclusively on activation of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_371797]. [12] In rodent models with  SCI, evidence  indicates that recovery of locomotor function depends 
largely on activation of spared supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_61569]  [13] and that there is an increased amplitude of lower limb 
motor evoked potentials following intensive locomotor training  in humans with SCI .[14] These studies suggest a 
relationship between the strength of corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_371798]. Therefore, it seems plausible that 
walking  function can be improved by [CONTACT_371821].  
 
A preponderance of the evidence suggests that corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_371799]. This notion  is supported by [CONTACT_371822][INVESTIGATOR_371800]. [15] Furthermore , non-invasive brain stimulation has been shown to  improve lower extremity strength , 
lower -limb control , gait , and balance. [16-19] Cortical stimulation with repet itive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) has been associated with improved walking function in persons with SCI  [20], although this 
form of stimulation has inherent drawbacks that limit its use in clinical settings . An alternative to rTMS is 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) , which  is a low -risk, non -invasive brain stimulation technique 
involving  low-intensity currents delivered to the motor cortex and aimed at modulating  cortical excitability. tDCS 
is affordable and lacks many of the drawbacks associated with rTMS, making it a more  clinically accessible  
technology . Emerging  studies in persons with stroke have combined tDCS with mo derately intense motor training  
and have demonstrated  increased dorsiflexor control, [16] quadriceps strength, [17, 18]  and balance. [17] tDCS may 
also have the capacity to modulat e excitability of spi[INVESTIGATOR_371801] .[21, 22]   
 
 
Based on the evidence  described above, we put forward  two primary goals  of the proposed project : 1) determine 
whether a moderate -intensity training program designed to increase control of gait -related movements can 
improve functional and neurophysiologic measures, and 2) determine whether training -related re sponses are 
larger when training is augmented with cortical stimulation to increase supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_371802].

2.0   Study Aims  and Hypotheses : 
 
2.1 Aim 1. Quantify effects of moderate -intensity motor training alone (MT -only group) and 
moderate -intensity motor training + tDCS (MT+tDCS group) on walking function and balance. 
We hypothesize that training will be associated with improvements in locomotor function 
(walking speed and step height), balance (Berg Balance Test), and leg muscle s trength 
(quadriceps and plantarflexor muscles). We also hypothesize that gains in the MT+tDCS group 
will be larger than those of the MT -only group.  
  
2.2 Aim 2. Quantify effects of moderate -intensity motor training alone (MT -only group) and 
moderate -intens ity motor training + tDCS (MT+tDCS group) on leg muscle strength and 
spasticity.  We hypothesize that training will be associated with We also hypothesize that gains 
with MT+tDCS group will be larger than those with MT -only.  
 
3.0 Study Design  
 
3.1 Study Sam ple: 
Thirty -five (35) participants  with chronic  (≥[ADDRESS_465129] injury), motor -incomplete  SCI (i.e. 
American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329248] (AIS) C or D) [23] will be recruited for the 
study . Upon enrollm ent, participants will be  expected to have some, but  limited, walking ability 
(detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria listed  below ). 
 
3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
The research participants  must meet all of  the following criteria to be eligible fo r the 
study:  
• Ability and willingness to consent and Authorization for use of PHI ; 
• Chronic SCI (≥[ADDRESS_465130] -injury) at or above the neurological level of T10 ; 
• Age 18 -65; 
• Able to stand (with or without the aid of an assistive device) for at least 5 minutes;  
• Able to advance each leg independently for at least 3 steps.  (For over ground 
locomotion, assistive devices including  ankle -foot orthoses [unilateral or bilateral], 
knee -ankle -foot orthoses [unilateral only], wa lkers, crutches, or canes  may be used ); 
• Able to rise from sit to stand requiring no more than moderate assistance from one 
person.  
 
3.1.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
The presence of any one of the follow ing criteria would lead to exclusion:  
• Inability or unwillingness to consent and Authorization for use of PHI ; 
• Progressive, or potentially progressive, spi[INVESTIGATOR_371803], or 
progressive vascular disorders of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831];  
• Injuries below the neurological spi[INVESTIGATOR_371804] T10;  
• History of cardiovascular irregularities;  
• Altered cognitive status;  
• Presence of orthopedic pathology that would adversely influence participation in the 
protocol (e.g. knee or hip flexion contractures of greater than 10 degrees);  
• Implanted metallic objects  in the cranium (e .g. aneurysm clips);  
• History of seizure s; 
 
Page 6 of 37 
 
 
  Version 6.0 08/ 27/2019  NOTE:  The use of prescription medications, including a baclofen pump for control of 
spasticity, will  not be a basis for exclusion so  long as the dosage has been stable for at 
least 90 days.  
 
3.2 Procedures : 
 
3.2.1 Research  Design : 
We propose a double -blinded, randomized , cross -over intervention study consisting of a 
moderate -intensity motor training circuit of gait -related upright motor control activities. We will 
also assess whether the addition of tDCS augments the training -related gains. Effects of training 
(and tDCS) on walking function, balance, strength, and spasticity will be assessed to determine 
whether there is preliminary evidence of efficacy of this approach.  
 
Stratified randomization:  To ensure equivalence of baseline data between groups, stratified 
randomization will be  used. We have shown that persons  with SCI who are ambulatory may be 
classified into one of two groups, with “less impaired” participants  having lower limb motor 
scores of >15 for one leg and ≥10 for the other leg; participants not meeting this criteria are 
classified as “more impaired ”.[3] To ensure equivalent distribution of more - and less -impaired 
participants  between groups,  individuals  will be stratified into one of these two strata based on the 
above criteria, with randomization to groups within each stratum.  
 
Schedule of Events :  
Individuals will be asked to participate in the study over two, 5 consecutive day periods . 
Following completion of the fifth day, participants will be asked to take 2 weeks off before 
returning to the lab to repeat the intervention schedule but in the opposite group in which they 
originally participated (i.e. MT -only to MT+tDCS; MT+tDCS  to MT -only). A detailed schedule 
of events including testing and intervention timing  is provided in Figure 1 .

  Version 6.0 08/ 27/2019  3.2.2 Interventions:  
Motor t raining (MT):  The muscles targeted for motor training have been  selected based on 
studies in persons with SCI that have identified the muscle groups tha t best predict walking 
ability. [24-27] Motor training ( see Figure  2) will consist of a circuit of activities that, with the 
exception of the toe tap task, will be performed while standing to promote upright control (the 
toe-tappi[INVESTIGATOR_371805], in our experience, many people with SCI are 
unabl e to perform this activity when the hip and knee are in an extended position). Participants 
will perform each of the 6 different training activities for one minute each (with modifications as 
necessary to allow successful execution ), alternating between le gs, until [ADDRESS_465131] been completed ( approximately 25 minutes total) . This exercise duration was selected based 
on prior studies showing that in persons with SCI, 10 minutes of moderate intensity activity (54% 
age-predicted maximum heart rate) increased serum levels of neurotrophic factor .[7] 
Furthermore, a single 15 -minute session of gait and balance training in combination with tDCS 
improved walking speed and balance in persons with motor dysfunction. [19]  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Moderate -intensity motor training activities.  Motor training a ctivities will be performed 
at an intensity intended to attain a target exercise intensity of 40 –59% of heart rate reserve (HRR) 
for 5 of 6 activities ; toe tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (the exception) performed in sitting, will provide the opportunity 
for scheduled rest.  During MT, all participants will we ar a heart rate monitor chest strap synced to 
a wrist watch to ensure that the optimal HR range is achieved. HRR will be calculated from 
resting and peak heart rate measures obtained during baseline testing via administration of a  
graded-exercise test (GXT ) (Appendix H) . The GXT will consist of a maximal continuous upper -
body exercise test performed on an arm crank cycle ergometer ( Monark  881E Arm Ergometer ). 
Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_371806] a 
cardiometabolic testing  device ( COSMED Quark CPET, Chicago, IL ). Heart rate  will be  assessed 
simultaneously using an  integrated hea rt rate monitor (Polar WearLink® + transmitter, Polar 
Electro Inc., NY ). Maximal GXT termination criteria and test procedures will be followed as per 
standards set forth by [CONTACT_25986].  
 
Non-invasive brain stimulation  (tDCS) : The tDCS electrode placement is based on procedures 
shown to improve gait and balance in a single session when used in combination  with gait 
training activities. [19] tDCS electrodes can simultaneously activate the bilateral  leg motor areas 
when placed at  the midline of the scalp slightly anterior to the vertex (anode) and at  the inion 
(cathode), with a current intensity of 2mA. The tDCS device is lightweight, and can be worn in a 
backpack during the MT activities.  As reported previously  [19], participants in the MT -only 
group will receive sham tDCS to maintain analogous study procedures.  Appendix A  provides a 
detailed description of tDCS set -up and implementation.

  Version 6.0 08/ 27/2019  3.2.3 Outcome Measures:  
Outcome measures will be assessed  at several time -points  throughout the study (see Figure 1 ). 
We emphasize that both moderate -intensity motor training and tDCS ha ve been reported to have 
significant single -session effects. Our testing schedule will allow us to capture both the 
immediate effects (also referred to as “ online effects ” [28]), and persistent effects (or “ offline 
effects ” [28]). Immediate Effects will be assessed within each intervention day, prior to and 
following the interventi on. Persistent Effects will be assessed by [CONTACT_371823] [ADDRESS_465132] s. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Walking Function : Walking speed will be the primary outcome measure for walking function, as 
speed has been the standard measure used in the literature and will allow us to assess outcomes 
relative to other published studies. As in our prior studies, funct ional walking capacity will be 
measured based on [ADDRESS_465133] distance. [3] The use of the [ADDRESS_465134] allows us to include individuals whose impairments result in inability to walk 
for 6 minutes. Kinematic data related to walking perfo rmance will be obtained using  an 
accelerometer -based motion cap ture system (Xsens MVN Biomech Awinda, Xsens, Enschede, 
Netherlands)  as the participant  walks along a 15 -meter path, using only the passive assistive 
devices they typi[INVESTIGATOR_292717] (e.g., lower limb orthotics, walker, forearm crutches). Secondarily, we 
will as sess gait quality as reflected by [CONTACT_371824], step length, and step symmetry. Appendix B 
provides a detailed description of walking function test set -up and implementation.  
 
Balance : Balance will be measured using  the Berg Balance Scale, which has been found to be 
valid for use in persons with SCI. Appendix C provides a detailed description of balance test set -
up and implementation.  
 
Fall Efficacy Scale -International (FES -I) 
The fear of falling may be a major conce rn for persons with mobility impairments and may limit 
one’s confidence  or ability  to perform activities of daily living  [29, 30] . Fear of falling may also 
limit an individual’s performance of specific overground motor tasks irrespective of functional 
ability to perform that task [31]. Therefore, the fear of falling will be an important factor to 
consider relative to the mobility interventions employed in the present study. The FES -I [32] will Table 1. Outcome measures timing.

  Version 6.0 08/ 27/[ADDRESS_465135] implementation.  
 
Isometric muscle strength Ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior) strength will be measured with 
the participant  seated, with the test foot strapped onto a foot plate that is  attached to a force 
transducer. An a nkle dorsiflexion test was selected based on evidence indicating  that the tibialis 
anterior  is under the greatest corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_371807]. [33, 34]  Maximum dorsiflexion torque will be 
calculated based on the maximum val ue obtained during three attempts. A similar approach will 
be used to assess knee extensor (quadriceps) strength, as prior studies have shown that a single 
session of tDCS improves quadriceps strength in persons with stroke. [18] Appendix E provides a 
detailed description of isometric strength test set -up and implementation.  
 
Functional lower extremity strength : The Five Times Sit -to-Stand test has been validated for use 
in persons with motor -incomplete SCI and shown to be correlated with wa lking ability. 
Consistent with our previous publications, we will implement the Modified Five -Times Sit -to-
Stand test as a measure of functional lower extremity strength. [35] In the modified version of this 
test, the participant will be seated on an adjustable mat table with height adjusted to 80% of lower 
extremity length (as measured in the standing position with shoes on from the greater trochanter 
to the flo or). The participant’s feet will be positioned shoulder width apart (as measured from the 
center of each foot equal to the distance between the acromion processes). The feet will be 
positioned either forward or backward until a position is reached in which  the lower leg is 
perpendicular to the floor. Participants will be instructed to, “stand up, balance, and sit back 
down.” The participant will begin in the seated position with back unsupported and will be given 
a “3-2-1-Go” command to initiate standing. R epetitions in which the participant fails to achieve 
full upright standing will not be counted (i.e., a standing attempt will not be counted if only a 
partial stand is completed). Participants will also be verbally encouraged to exert equal effort 
between legs when standing. The total time required to complete 5 repetitions of standing up and 
sitting down (without using the upper extremities for assistance) will be recorded. Participants 
unable to complete the task without upper extremity support will be gi ven a maximum time of 
180 seconds (3minutes) so that pre/post differences can be calculated.  If participant s are not able 
to obtain this position or cannot stand without modifying this position, they will also be given a 
score of [ADDRESS_465136] set -up and implementation.  
 
Spasticity:  Both motor training [9, 11, 15]  and the use of tDCS [21, 22]  have  been assoc iated with 
decreased spasticity. W e will use the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_371808] -only and MT+tDCS on spasticity. This measure is well correla ted with 
electrophy siological  measures of spasticity  and is better correlated with self -reported measures of 
spasm frequency than the Ashworth test. [36] Appendix G provides a detailed description of 
spasticity test set -up and implementation.
 
Serum Brain -Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF):  Serum concentrations of BDNF  
will be measured in venous blood. Venous blood samples (10 mL) will be drawn by a 
Shepherd Center phlebotomist and stored in pre -chilled serum venipuncture tubes. 
Samples will be allowed to clot for 1 hour at room temperature and 1 hour at 4°C. Serum 
will be separated by [CONTACT_7891] (1000 x g for 15 min) and stored in Eppendorf tubes at 
-70°C until analysis. At least once per month, blood samples will be transported by [CONTACT_371825], Department of Applied 
Physiology for analyses. Blood s erum samples will be analyzed for BDNF by [CONTACT_28745] -
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) u sing Mature Rapid ELISA  kits from Biosensis 
(Cat #: BEK -2211 -1P/2P, Biosensis Pty Ltd., SA, Australia) with a detection range from

  Version 6.0 08/ 27/2019  7.8 pg/ml to 500 pg/ml. Preparation of mature BDNF standard and other assay 
procedures will be followed according to manufact urer’s specifications  (Appendix I ). A 
total of 4 blood samples will be collected for each participant, and serum BDNF 
concentrations (ng/ml) will be compared across the following time points: baseline ( Day 
1), pre -exercise ( Day 2), post -exercise ( Day 2), a nd persistent test ( Day 5).

4.0 Adverse Events  
 
4.1 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  - any untoward physical or psychological occurrence or 
undesirable and unintended effect for a participant  that may present itself during 
interventions and interactions used in the research or the collection of identifiable 
private informat ion under the re search, regardless of whether there may or may 
not be a relationship with the research intervention.   
 
Unanticipated Adverse Event  – any adverse event, the specificity, frequency or 
severity of which is not consistent with either:  
 
• The known or foreseeabl e risk of adverse events associated with the 
procedures involved in the research that are described in the protocol related -
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed c onsent 
document, and other relevant so urces  of information, such as product 
labeling and package inserts; or  
• The expe cted natural progression of any underlying disease or condition of 
the participant (s) experiencing the adverse event  
 
Anticipated Adverse Event:  - an adverse event that is not an unanticipated 
adverse event.  The following adverse events are considered as anticipated:  
 
• Although tDCS has been shown to have minimal risk compared to other 
forms of non -invasive brain stimulat ion (i.e. T MS)[37], it has been 
associated with temporary itching/tingling at stimulation onset/offset and,  
occasionally, headaches. tDCS is associated with skin irritation and 
superficial blistering; however, the occurrence of these side effects is rare 
and, when t hey do occur, temporary.  
Page 11 of 37 
 
 
  Version 6.0 08/ 27/2019  • Motor  training activities consist of  dynamic exercises involving concentric 
and eccentric muscle contractions . This type of training may increase the 
mechanical forces placed on muscles and connective tissues of the lower 
extremiti es beyond that which participant s may be accustomed. As a result, 
participants may experience signs and symptoms of delayed onset muscle 
soreness (DOMS) within the first 24 -48 hours of training, the severity of 
which should lessen over the course of the training period . Participant s’ 
perceived severity of DOMS will be assessed prior to each session using a [ADDRESS_465139], and 
return for the next scheduled session.  Participant s will be assessed  for 
pain/swelling of the lower limbs and joints prior to each  training session and 
any abnormalities will be referred appropriately for medical management.  
• There may be risks associated with blood tests. Taking blood may 
cause discomfort, bruising and, very rarely, infection where the needle 
goes into the skin. Participants  may also experience dizziness, nausea, 
or fainting during blood draws . Participants wil l be instructed to 
inform the attending phlebotomist drawing the blood or other member 
of the study team i f they are  not feel ing well while blood is being 
taken  or at a ny time after blood has been taken.  
 
Unantici pated Adverse Device Effect  – any serious a dverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was to previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or ap plication 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of participant s. 
 
Related or possibly related to the research:  - an event is relat ed to the research if, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237], it could not have been produced by 
[CONTACT_2299] ’s clinical condition or environment, follows a known pattern of 
response to intervention, disappears or decreases with reduction in dose  or 
cessation of intervention and/or recurs with re -exposure and/or it was more likely 
than not to be the result of the collection/disclosure of identifiable private 
information in the research and/or the interventions used in the research.  
 
Unrelated to t he research:  - an adverse event is unrelated to the research if, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237], the adve rse event is clearly due to 
extraneous c auses (e.g., underlying disease or environment) does not follow a 
known pattern of response to in tervention, and/or does not reappear or worsen 
with re -introduction of the intervention.  
 
Serious Adverse Event:   an event is considered serious if it results in death, is 
life-threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], 
cause s persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a birth defect or 
congen ital malformation,  represents, in the Principal I nvestigator’s judgment, 
other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to research participant s or 
others, or any other event as described  in the research process.

are considered source documentation and will be collected and reviewed to 
confirm clinical events and may be utilized for data analysis. Data will be 
collected on  all participant s via an eCRF .  The CRF  will contain no participant  
names.  The participant  code field will be a patient study number,  numbered 
sequentially as entered into the electronic database.  A separate master code list 
will be constructed by [CONTACT_093]/ study coordinator that will list the patient 
name [CONTACT_371833].  This list will be maintained in a 
password protected file to which only investigators involved in the project will 
have access.  
 
Upon c ompletion of data collection, an eCRF  will be printed for the participant , 
signed by a Principal Investigator, and  filed in the participant ’s research chart . 
 
5.2   Database  
Data will be collected and maintained in electronic form by  [CONTACT_125699]. Brandon Poe.  
Data entry, development of the primary database, and all statistical analyse s will 
be the responsibility of [CONTACT_371836] s Evans . The electronic database will be 
backed up per institutional guidelines.  
  
5.3   External Documentation:  
During administration of the patient questionnaire, if it is identified that a 
participant  sought  treatment from a source outside of the Hulse Spi[INVESTIGATOR_371810], additional data will be 
obtained from external physician offices or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371811].  All data will be entered onto the follow -up eCRF . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_465142] further documentation such as physician 
and/or procedure notes when complications are observed and reported.  [CONTACT_371837] 
will also be responsible for auditing the database and confirming the overall 
integrity of the data. He  will e nsure that all information pertaining to significant 
new developments and unanticipated adverse events are provided to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities, the Investigators, and to the IRB. 
 
Monitoring of the study will be conducted at regular intervals in order to monitor 
study conduct and maintain Good Clinical Research Practice.  These inspections 
are conducted in order to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness 
and accuracy of the d ata being entered into the eCRF.  
 
6.0 Statisti cal Considerations  
Page 14 of 37 
 
 
  Version 6.0 08/ 27/[ADDRESS_465143] provide the research methodology with sufficient detail to answer the following 
questions:  
1) Is the sample size and nature appropriate for the goals of the study?  
2) For placebo -controlled studies, is there ade quate justification for a placebo arm; is the duration of the 
intervention limited to that which is minimally necessary; is there adequate monitoring of participant s 
receiving placebo?  
3) Are there defined endpoints for discontinuing experimental treatmen t in the event of a worsening 
condition?  
4) Is the proposed research design and statistical treatment of data appropriate and sufficient?  
5) Does the proposed research carry enough likelihood of yielding valid information to warrant the 
participation of S hepherd Center patients?  
 
6.[ADDRESS_465144] deviations and 95% confidence 
intervals of the pre -post change for each condition will calculated for all 
measures. The baseline chara cteristics of the participant s assigned to the [ADDRESS_465145] (day 1) to Persistence test (day 5)  for the two 
intervention groups  will be compared using repeated mea sures ANOVA followed 
by [CONTACT_371826] -wise contrasts between the two groups. Pair -wise t -tests with Bonferoni 
correction for multiple comparisons will be used to evaluate within -day change 
for each of the [ADDRESS_465146] size and 95 % 
confidence interval associated with effects to identify the outcome measures that 
are most sensitive to change following intervention with MT -only and 
MT+tDCS. We will also assess variable s associated with responsiveness to 
intervention, using logistic l inear regression to identify the variables that are most 
strongly associated with change in our primary outcome measure of walking 
function . Where significant pre/post differences exist among the primary 
outcome measures and blood serum concentrations of B DNF, Pearson correlation 
coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength of any relationship that 
might exist between measures of walking function and changes in BDNF 
concentration.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_465147] size of 0.69. [15] Based on this effect size, in order to identify pre -
post differences due to training using the full study sample , a sample size of 15 
participant s is required to obtain a power of 0.8 with α = 0.05. However, since we 
are a lso interested in between -group  differences between the MT+tDCS and MT -
only groups, if we assume an additive or larger effect of the tDCS, it will be 
necessary to double the sampl e size to 30, with 15 participant s per group to 
identify significant between -groups differences at the same power and alpha 
levels. To accommodate an anticipated 15% attrition rate we will enroll 35 
participant s.

The principles of informed consent are described in the Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR, part 50 and 45 CFR, part 46.  Once the Investigator has 
determined the patient’s eligibility for the study, the background of t he proposed 
study and the benefits and risks of the procedures and study must be explained to 
the participant .  The participant  must be able to comprehend the informed 
consent form and must sign it prior to performing any study specific procedures 
or prior  to receiving medication.  The participant  will receive a copy of the 
informed consent.  The original signed informed consent and Authorization for 
Use/Disclosure of PHI will be maintained in the participant ’s research chart.  
Only those participants  who s ign the IRB approved informed consent prior to 
participation are eligible to be in the study.  Failure to provide written informed 
consent renders the patient ineligible for the study.

Clonus of the plantarflexors was quantified in response 
to a rapid passive dorsiflexion of the ankle (A). The 
ankle was dorsiflexed at an angle that  triggered clonus, 
and the duration of clonic bursts was timed. An ordinal 
rating from 0 to 3 was determined by [CONTACT_371831] 0 is no reaction; 1 is mild, clonus 
was maintained less than 3 seconds; 2 is moderate, 
clonus persisted be tween 3 and 10 seconds; and 3 is 
severe, clonus persisted for more than 10 seconds.    SCATS: Clonus  
0 0 no reaction  
1 1 Mild <3 secs  
2 2 3< Moderate <10 secs  
3 3 Severe > 10 secs  
         
  SCATS:  flexor spasms.        With the knee and hip extended to 0°, the clinician 
applied a pi[INVESTIGATOR_371819] [ADDRESS_465184]’s foot (B). Excursion of the big toe 
into extension, ankle dorsiflexion, and knee and hip 
flexion were visually observed fo r severity. The rating 
scale consisted of a score from 0 to 3, where 0 is no 
reaction to stimulus; 1 is mild, less than 10° of excursion 
in flexion at the knee and hip or extension of the great 
toe; 2 is moderate, 10° to 30° of flexion at the knee nd 
hip; and 3 is severe, 30° or greater of knee and hip 
flexion.  0 0 no reaction  
1 1 less than 10° of excursion in 
flexion at the knee and hip or 
extension of the great toe  
2 2 moderate, 10° to 30° of flexion 
at the knee and hip  
3 3 severe, 30° or greater of knee 
and hip flexion.  
         
  SCATS:  extensor spasms          With the contralateral limb extended, the tested 
knee and hip were positioned at angle of 90° to 110° of 
hip and knee flexion, and then both joints were 
simultaneously extended. One hand cupped the heel 
while the other was placed on the outside of the thigh 
(C). Once a reaction was elicited, the duration of visible 
muscle contraction in the quadriceps muscle was 
measured by [CONTACT_371832]. The timed scale (0 –3) that was used for clonus 
was also applied to the timed ex tensor spasms.  0 0 no reaction  
1 1 Mild <3 secs  
2 2 3secs < Moderate <10 secs  
3 3 Severe > 10 secs

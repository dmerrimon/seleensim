[ADDRESS_512681] cancer is hormone sensitive and treated with 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) (i.e., tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) to reduce risk of recurrence and improve survival; however, adherence to AET among breast cancer survivors (BCS) is overwhelmingly poor, with half of women becoming non-adherent within five years. Difficulty copi[INVESTIGATOR_406589] (i.e., depression or anxiety) are major barriers to adherence. There is a dearth of efficacious interventions targeting the needs and adherence challenges of BCS prescribed AET. To address this gap, the proposed study employs a mixed-methods design to develop and test an evidence-based, psychosocial videoconference intervention (STRIDE) to enhance adherence to AET, improve symptom management, and reduce distress in s at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406590]. Phase 1 included (1) semi-structured interviews with BCS on AET (n=30) and intervention development with psychologists and oncology clinicians (DF/HCC Protocol #17-201). Phase 2 will entail a run-in phase (Arm A; n=5) to evaluate acceptability and refine the intervention and a randomized controlled trial (Arm B; n=100) to assess the feasibility of comparing the STRIDE intervention to a medication monitoring control with assessments and adherence monitoring over the course of six months. This study lays the groundwork for a full-scale randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy of the psychosocial videoconference intervention to improve symptom management, enhance adherence to AET, and reduce distress for BCS.   Theoretical basis for proposed intervention The proposed study aims are based on guidelines for developi[INVESTIGATOR_406591]: the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) Model, put forth by [CONTACT_406636].[ADDRESS_512682] from testing of a fixed protocol. The model emphasizes 1) designing or adapting the behavioral intervention based on drivers of behavior that are treatment targets and refining practical intervention aspects (i.e., mode of delivery, duration) using methods such as qualitative data collection to evaluate and revise content (Phase 1 of the proposed study, DF/HCC Protocol #17-201) using proof-of-concept and feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_406592] a behavioral efficacy trial (Phase 2 of the proposed study: this protocol). The design is informed by a framework for medication adherence,2,3 the Cognitive Model of Adjustment to Cancer,4 and the Health Belief Model3,5,6 (HBM; see Figure 1). Step 1 is informed by [CONTACT_406637]’s2 framework for medication adherence. The proposed intervention will address patient and treatment factors with strategies for reducing distress, monitoring and managing side effects, and addressing the interaction between psychological and medical adherence concerns.4 The HBM, in the context of cancer and adherence,7 maintains that the health behavior (i.e. taking medication) will be adopted if the patient perceives (a) risk for a condition, (b) that the medication will reduce risk/severity, (c) that benefits outweigh costs, and (d) self-efficacy for taking medication.3,[ADDRESS_512683], financial distress

 Innovation of proposed study This will be the first study to develop and test an evidence-based intervention that is flexible, portable, and tailored to address AET adherence barriers unique to BCS. The proposed strategy implements a mixed-methods design based on the ORBIT model,1 integrates a comprehensive conceptual framework, adapts an established, evidence-based treatment, and employs novel technologies in the following three ways: 1) Tailored intervention content. 2) Videoconferencing. The use of tele-mental health ZOOM technology limits barriers to treatment such as cost, time, and travel, thereby [CONTACT_406638].8 We  will extend the use of videoconferencing to BCS reporting difficulty managing their AET. 3) Objective, electronic measurement. Since self-report methods tend to yield overestimates of adherence;9-12 We will use the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS13) in addition to self-report measures. Thus, this study employs existing technologies in a novel setting to model longitudinal change in AET adherence in the intervention and control groups.13   Specific Aims 1. Primary Aim.  To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a tailored, small-group, Telehealth intervention (STRIDE) compared to a medication monitoring control for survivors of breast cancer taking AET. Hypothesis 1: The study will be feasible, defined by [CONTACT_193531] (enrollment rate > 50%), retention (follow-up assessment completion rate > 70% of all participants who complete baseline) and attendance (attendance rate of at least 70% of participants completing at least 4 of 6 sessions [67%]).  Hypothesis 2: The study will be acceptable demonstrated by >75% of participants reporting average satisfaction scores greater than the scale’s mid-point (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire). 2. Secondary Aim: To assess effects of the STRIDE intervention on adherence to AET, symptom distress, and satisfaction with AET. Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that participation in the STRIDE intervention will be associated with an increase in adherence and satisfaction with AET and a decrease in symptom distress at 12-weeks compared to the medication monitoring control, and that these improvements will maintain at 24-week follow-up.  3. Exploratory Aims: a. To assess the effects of the STRIDE intervention on several psychosocial constructs, exploring potential mediator and moderators of the intervention.  Exploratory Hypothesis: We will explore whether participation in the STRIDE intervention is associated with an increase in quality of life (QOL) and medication-taking self-efficacy and a decrease in distress (anxiety and depression) at 12-weeks compared to the medication monitoring control, and whether these improvements are maintained at 24-week follow-up. We will also explore mediators of the intervention such as copi[INVESTIGATOR_406593], and demographic and treatment-related moderators of the intervention.  b. To examine reasons for deciding not to participate in this social behavioral trial.  Exploratory Hypothesis: In efforts to inform future studies and gain insight into barriers to participate in this study, we will examine participant reasons for choosing not to participate. It is hypothesized that participants approached about the study who choose not to participate will do so for a variety of reasons, such as time constraints. 2.[ADDRESS_512684] commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S.; 1 in 8 women (12%) will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.14 Approximately 60-75% of breast malignancies are hormone sensitive (i.e., 
 hormone receptor-positive)[ADDRESS_512685] cancer.16 AET (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) significantly improves outcomes for early-stage, hormone-receptor positive BCS.[ADDRESS_512686] cancer recurrence and mortality were reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50% and 30%, respectively, with tamoxifen.17 However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_406594], half of women are non-adherent within five years of initiating AET.18 A systematic review showed that adherence to tamoxifen and AIs ranged from 41-88%, and 50-91%, respectively.[ADDRESS_512687] cancer were previously prescribed five years of AET, recent studies showed that continued therapy up to 10 years further reduces risk of recurrence and mortality.25 With this new evidence, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) now recommends [ADDRESS_512688] cancer outcomes. Tailored interventions are warranted that address modifiable predictors of non-adherence. These predictors include patient, disease, treatment, and provider/healthcare system factors (see Figure 1 in previous section). Patient-related factors are the most significant correlates of non-adherence and include perceptions of low recurrence risk,29 necessity for AET,30 and low self-efficacy in taking medication.29 Patient sociodemographic factors include age,20 out-of-pocket medication costs,31 financial distress,29 and health literacy.32 Disease factors include having a recurrent cancer or a larger invasive ductal carcinoma.33 On the treatment level, AET-related side effects (e.g, joint pain, hot flashes, sleep difficulties, cognitive symptoms) negatively influence adherence.[ADDRESS_512689] to provider/healthcare system factors, suboptimal patient-physician communication is associated with worse adherence to AET.[ADDRESS_512690] address several of these modifiable factors. Additionally, depression and anxiety are significant risk factors for treatment non-adherence.35 BCS commonly experience distress following treatment, with approximately 33% reporting depressive symptoms36 and 18% reporting anxiety.37 Significant AET-related side effects and toxicities such as joint pain, hot flashes, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction often underlie the emotional distress reported by [CONTACT_406639].34 Importantly, BCS who report negative emotions related to AET and distress related to side effects are less likely to be adherent.29 A recent meta-analysis concluded that management of depression may enhance adherence to AET and improve cancer outcomes.38 Thus, it is imperative that an evidence-based intervention addresses each individual’s depressive or anxiety symptoms and the potential sources of distress such as AET-related side effects and side effect-related interference with daily functioning.  With regard to intervention development, ASCO guidelines advocate for an approach that meets the psychosocial needs of patients based on the severity of their symptoms.[ADDRESS_512691] a theoretically and empi[INVESTIGATOR_406595], videoconference, tailored intervention to enhance AET adherence, improve symptom management, and reduce distress for BCS. The intervention will be referred to as STRIDE: Symptom-Targeted Randomized Intervention for Distress and Adherence to Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy among Breast Cancer Survivors.  In this study, early-stage, hormone receptor-positive BCS with distress related to AET, adherence difficulties, or side effects, will be offered participation. The STRIDE intervention will include cognitive-behavioral strategies for adherence, distress, and symptom management with adaptations from CBT for Adherence and Depression,41 
 which is shown to improve adherence via integration of adherence counseling and skills-based treatment for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms.41 To minimize burden and increase access, we propose to deliver the STRIDE intervention via ZOOMTM software. ZOOM is a HIPAA-secure [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH)-approved skype-like modality that will be used in psychiatry department for group virtual visits. Following semi-structured interviews and intervention development (completed Phase 1), we will test acceptability in a run-in phase and feasibility in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_406596]. Findings will inform future research and the planning and implementation of a full-scale efficacy trial. In the long-term, results may have implications for breast cancer survivorship care plans and the provision of efficient support for BCS on AET. Ultimately, improved adherence may optimize disease-related outcomes for BCS. Preliminary Studies Cognitive-behavioral interventions can lower depressive symptoms and cancer-specific distress in breast cancer. Based on findings that a 10-week Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention combining CBT and relaxation training is beneficial during treatment for early-stage breast cancer,42,43 I studied the long-term effects of CBSM.44,45 At five-year follow-up, BCS (N=130) who received CBSM post-surgery reported fewer depressive symptoms than the control group (p=.030). At the 11-year follow-up (N=100), participation in the CBSM group was associated with better quality of life (p=.040) and fewer depressive symptoms (p=.030).[ADDRESS_512692] cancer in the CBT intervention reported less cancer-specific distress compared to the attention control (p=.004). Our findings show that cognitive-behavioral interventions are beneficial for reducing cancer-specific distress during breast cancer treatment and may improve distress symptoms for BCS in the short- and long-term.  Psychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent in BCS prescribed AET. Of the 240 women who participated in the CBSM study, 67% were prescribed AET. One-year post-surgery, 27.6% of these women reported elevated depressive symptoms, and 37.0% reported elevated anxiety. These findings are comparable to population rates, highlighting the need to mitigate distress in BCS taking AET. Furthermore, preliminary data from our ongoing studies in the Cancer Outcomes Research Program, co-directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jennifer Temel and [CONTACT_406685], suggest that the proportion of MGH patients with breast cancer and depression and/or anxiety is congruent with published estimates of up to 33% of BCS reporting anxiety or depressive symptoms.73,74  Specifically, in a current Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded study (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_406597]) to improve adherence and symptom management in patients with cancer prescribed oral chemotherapy, 27% of women with breast cancer at MGH reported clinically elevated levels of anxiety, and 12% reported clinically elevated levels of depression on the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]. After completion of active treatment, these women will become eligible for participation in the proposed study. Furthermore, in a survivorship needs assessment survey completed by 130 MGH BCS (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jeffrey Peppercorn and [CONTACT_9457]), 46% of women reported experiencing anxiety symptoms “sometimes,” and 22% reported experiencing anxiety symptoms “most of the time” or “always”. In addition, 35% of MGH BCS reported experiencing sadness “sometimes,” and 9% experienced sadness “most of the time” or “always.” Of these MGH BCS who were prescribed AET, 57% reported experiencing anxiety symptoms “sometimes,” 22% reported experiencing anxiety symptoms “most of the time” or “always,” 51% reported experiencing depressive symptoms “sometimes”, and 5% reported depressive symptoms “most of the time” or “always.”  Systematic review finds few interventions for AET adherence. I collaborated with [CONTACT_406685] to publish a systematic review of adherence to oral cancer therapy,[ADDRESS_512693] Cancer (DF/HCC Protocol #17-201). Between 11/2017-11/2018, [ADDRESS_512694] four weeks. Additionally, 30% of BCS (n=9) who completed interviews indicated high levels of distress (as determined by a score of ≥8 on the PHQ-9 and ≥10 on the GAD-7). We gathered feedback related to (1) experiences with and perceptions of AET (including side effects, adherence, and distress), (2) interest in a supportive, psychosocial intervention; (3) applicability of intervention content; (4) intervention length, timing, and delivery; and (5) anticipated challenges to participation. After interviews were complete, we created a thematic coding framework to analyze these qualitative data and made modifications to the STRIDE intervention based on results. Ultimately, qualitative findings indicate that BCS need and desire a supportive intervention for taking AET. While the initial primary focus was on adherence, we added foci of symptom management and distress to ensure patient-centeredness based on BCS reported experiences. In addition, while we originally planned a stepped-care intervention in the proposed grant with flexibility to modify this based on this qualitative phase, it became apparent that this model would not adequately support the needs of these women and we revised it to be a brief intervention for all women with distress related to AET, adherence, or symptoms/side effects. Taking preferences into account, the STRIDE intervention was modified to be group-based with the option of individual sessions. We retained videoconference delivery with an option for in-person sessions at the preference of the participant. We shortened the sessions from the originally planned 8-11 to a total of five weekly 60-minute sessions with two follow-up phone check-ins. We also shortened the overall study length from eight months to six months. Feedback was also solicited from clinicians and experts as planned, including Drs. Joseph Greer (primary mentor and expert in intervention development), Jennifer Temel (secondary mentor and expert in cancer outcomes research), Steven Safren (advisor with adherence expertise), Ann Partridge and Jeff Peppercorn (breast oncologists with expertise in adherence to AET and survivorship), and Elyse Park (expert in qualitative methodology). A review of the STRIDE intervention was also conducted with oncology clinicians and nurse practitioners that work directly with this BCS population. Following our 5-person run-in phase, we finalized the intervention by [CONTACT_406640]. The intervention is now a 6-session, group-based, virtual intervention with two follow-up phone check-ins. Finally, breast cancer survivors who participated in the STRIDE program and self-identified as part of a minority racial/ethnic population (e.g. Black, Asian, Latinx, etc.) will be offered the opportunity to participate in an exit interview provide feedback. Previous studies (e.g. #17-201) have successfully administered exit interviews to modify and improve patient-centered interventional programs utilizing participant feedback. This interview will lake approximately [ADDRESS_512695] cancer survivors who are part of racial/ethnic minority populations, as interventions to improve AET adherence should be culturally sensitive.     Summary. Taken together, these studies highlight (a) the need for development and testing of interventions based on theory and evidence to enhance adherence to AET, improve symptom management, and reduce distress for BCS; (b) the ongoing high levels of distress reported by [CONTACT_406641]; and (c) the potential for a cognitive behavioral intervention to be a promising modality for addressing distress in BCS. With the knowledge from my prior work and qualitative phase of this mixed-methods study, the proposed research aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of the STRIDE intervention compared to a medication monitoring control.   
 3.[ADDRESS_512696] Cancer. Study staff will screen BCS’ electronic health records (EHR) for demographic and clinical eligibility criteria and request permission from the oncology clinician to approach patients at clinic appointments (HIPAA waiver detailing EHR access has been submitted to DF/HCC IRB). Specifically, study staff will email the cancer care team (i.e., oncologist, nurse practitioner) to inquire if they have any reservations about the study team approaching the patient for study participation at the next scheduled clinic visit. Clinicians will be sent an email containing the patient’s name, EHR number, and date of her appointment (Appendix 30.1). This email will include an informative handout for clinicians to familiarize themselves with study aims and relevant procedures to assist in informing their decision on granting permission for study staff to approach a patient (Appendix 30.2). If a clinician does not respond to the email soliciting reservations about approaching the patient, study staff will approach the provider in-person to request approach permission. If study staff are unable to approach a potentially eligible patient in-clinic, study staff will attach a study flyer to the patient’s chart for them to receive at the visit, and thus initiate a passive introduction to the study. To ensure providers are aware of study staff intent to re-approach the patient at a later date, study staff will send the clinician and additional email prior to any future patient approach. If any aspect of patient eligibility or ineligibility is unclear from patient screening, trained study staff will communicate with oncology clinicians verbally or via email to clarify the eligibility status of a patient. Additionally, if not found in the EHR, study staff may clarify the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score with the patient using the brief questionnaire in Appendix 30.27. Study staff will finalize assessment of patient eligibility upon approach, as detailed in Section 5.0 of this protocol. 3.2 Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria Eligibility criteria (Table 1) will maximize homogeneity, reflect study focus, enhance rigor, and consider limitations. The intervention targets adherence barriers identified in women, as male BCS face different challenges.47 While patients with metastatic cancer are also treated with endocrine therapy, there are different facilitators and barriers to adherence with incurable disease. Therefore, the focus on early-stage BCS preserves the intervention scope. BCS with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) or Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS) will be eligible as they experience distress related to breast cancer and adherence challenges to AET as well. The recruitment window of [ADDRESS_512697] 60 participants will complete study participation. Participants who self-identify as part of a minority racial/ethnic population will be offered the opportunity to participate in a qualitative, semi-structured exit interview to explore patient feedback on the cultural awareness relevance of the STRIDE study, regardless of randomization. This interview will last approximately 15 minutes. 3.3 Special Populations No special populations, including adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults, pregnant women, or prisoners, will not be included in this study. Table 1.  Inclusion Criteria 1. Female 2. Age 21 or older 3. Diagnosis of early-stage (Stage 0-IIIb), hormone receptor + breast cancer 
 
4.0 Study-Wide Number of Subjects We propose a four-center run-in period (n=5) and randomized-controlled trial (n=100) of an evidence-based telehealth intervention for a total of [ADDRESS_512698] any responsibilities regarding recruitment or enrollment. All study sites will be open through the DF/HCC IRB as the IRB of record.  Participants will be recruited through the following three methods: • EHR Screening: As detailed above (Section 3.1), study staff will screen the MGH Center for Breast Cancer clinic schedules at the MGH [LOCATION_011], MGH Northshore, MGH Waltham, and Newton-Wellesley satellite site for potentially eligible patients (under the use of a HIPAA waiver, submitted to the DF/HCC IRB). If a study staff member is attempting to recruit a potentially eligible patient through an affiliate site, they will utilize the study screening and telephone scripts (Appendices 30.3 & 30.4) • The Partners Rally Recruitment Portal: Study staff will submit a recruitment advertisement to the Partners Rally Recruitment Portal (advertisement detailed in Appendix 30.5). Through this portal, interested and potentially eligible patients will be able to send their contact [CONTACT_114369]. The study team will then reach out to interested patients and use the study screening and telephones scripts to assess fit and eligibly for the study (Appendices 30.3 & 30.4). • Provider & Self-Referral: Patients may be referred to contact [CONTACT_406642] a study flyer (Appendix 30.6), seeing a study flyer posted in-clinic, or by [CONTACT_406643]. Study site-PIs may also consent patients for the study. If a patient reaches out to the study staff, the study team will use the study screening and telephones scripts to assess fit and eligibly for the study (Appendices 30.3 & 30.4).  For patients meeting initial eligibility criteria and with clinician approval, trained study staff will approach the patient at their clinic visit to explain the study and conduct the informed 4.Within 1 week-36 months of starting adjuvant endocrine therapy  5.

 consent discussion. Study staff will use Appendix 30.1 to notify the patient’s clinician of the intended approach. The study staff will initially introduce the study to patients and ask if they are currently taking their AET. If the patient indicates that they are not interested in the study, study staff will collect the reason for refusal, for the purposes of documentation and future study reporting. If the patient indicates that they are interested in the study and are currently taking their AET, the study staff will screen the potentially eligible patient using the study staff screening script (Appendix 30.3). The brief screening questions are intended to assess the fit of the patient for the study. The participant will screen in to the study if she indicates an answer of [ADDRESS_512700] for further questions (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_406598]). It also will state that participation is voluntary, participants can refuse to answer any questions, participants can withdraw from the study at any time, and study participation is in no way related to their medical care. If a participant is unable to be approached in-person or consented in-clinic due to external factors, such as lack of clinic space or patient time constraints, the study team may reach out to potential participants over the phone. Prior to initiating phone contact, the study team will utilize the same provider email to assess if the provider has any reservations about the study staff contact[CONTACT_5713] (Appendix 30.1). If the patient does not have an upcoming appointment in clinic, study staff may call the potentially eligible patient using the recruitment phone script and screening script to gauge interest and eligibility (Appendices 30.3 & 30.4). Study staff will not call more than three times total or leave more than two voice messages (Appendix 30.7). If the patient expresses interest and screens in, the study team will begin the electronic informed consent (EIC) process outlined in Section 27.0. 5.2 Participant Communication Study staff will ask for preferred participant communication methods upon time of approach. Participants will fill out the Participant Locator Form (Appendix 30.12) to indicate best contact [CONTACT_406644]. Potential communication includes in-person, by [CONTACT_648], email, or SMS Text Messaging. Phone and email communication have been successful strategies to communicate with patients in prior psychosocial studies, and email templates intended for study use can be found in Appendix 30.14. SMS Messaging. Participants may elect to provide a personal mobile phone number and provide permission to receive SMS messages via an online service (GoogleVoice) regarding the study that the study staff will monitor. Before doing so, participants will be informed of the limitations of using GoogleVoice, particularly emphasizing that it is not HIPAA-compliant and thus does not offer protection over their personal health information. Additionally, participants will be informed that this phone number is not monitored regularly and should not be used for urgent or emergency purposes. Participants will be advised that, in the case of an emergency, they should contact [CONTACT_406645]. In the event participants still prefer the use of text messaging, study staff will send brief messages containing limited information regarding scheduling, reminders, and follow-up. Participants will be provided with the number for SMS study-related communications. Study staff will follow the templates as outlined in Appendix 30.13 for SMS communication. Under the discretion of trained study staff and extenuating circumstances, study staff may stray from the following templates to address scheduling/reminder situations not covered by [CONTACT_406646]. Under no circumstances 
 will study staff ever screen or discuss personal medical history, exchange personal health information, or other sensitive information via SMS message. If a participant introduces sensitive information, including but not limited to the examples just listed, into a SMS message conversation, the study staff member will direct the participant to call them to discuss it further over the phone. Send Secure Email. Participants will be provided with the Partners Privacy language regarding encrypted emails and given the opportunity to opt-out of Send Secure emails. In previous psychosocial studies, participants have articulated difficulties with accessing encrypted emails and prefer the option to opt-out of such method of encrypted communication. Further procedures on this opt-out process can be found in Section 27.[ADDRESS_512701] by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC IRB. As detailed in Section 5.0, the study staff at MGH [LOCATION_011] will maintain full responsibility of recruitment and enrollment at MGH [LOCATION_011] and at the MGH-affiliate sites. The MGH [LOCATION_011] study team will communicate with providers at Newton-Wellesley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], MGH North Shore, and MGH Waltham regarding permission to approach patients over the phone, as detailed in section 3.0, and on the progress of the study or any protocol updates. Site-PIs and peripheral study staff at the satellite site may assist with referrals but that is the extent of their role in study conduct. All participants will be registered and enrolled on OnCore through MGH [LOCATION_011], regardless of where a participant’s primary oncologist is located. All participants will complete the intervention and all study procedures through study staff at MGH [LOCATION_011]. A HIPAA waiver was submitted to the DF/HCC and authorization approved for all sites to which the study is open. 6.2 Multi-Site Communication Study staff at the lead site will periodically communicate via phone or email with the satellite site to update sites on study progress or any modifications to study protocol. 6.3  Multi-Site Confidentiality All study data will be stored and maintained by [CONTACT_406647], MGH [LOCATION_011]. There will be no transmission of study data (e.g., study assessments, exit interview transcripts) from MGH-affiliate sites to MGH [LOCATION_011]. As detailed above, MGH [LOCATION_011] study staff will be responsible for all recruitment and enrollment, including the completion and storage of all participant and study data. This study does not involve any collection of participant specimens.  6.4 Institution Change of Previous Study Member Emily Walsh is a predoctoral psychology trainee in the University of Miami Department of Psychology. [CONTACT_406686] was previously engaged in this research study as the primary clinical research coordinator of the study (e.g., recruitment, enrollment, and completion of participant study interviews) from September [ADDRESS_512702]. Jamie Jacobs will assume PI [INVESTIGATOR_406599]. Walsh’s role will be to conduct research activities (data interpretations and discussions) at the University of Miami. [CONTACT_406686]’s research activities will also be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Antoni, a PI [INVESTIGATOR_406600]. All data activities will be completed with deidentified participant transcripts for qualitative analysis under the 
 direct supervision of [CONTACT_406687] and [CONTACT_406688] and will be for use only by [CONTACT_18854]. Walsh under [CONTACT_406688]’s supervision at the University of Miami.   7.0 Study Timelines Table 2 depi[INVESTIGATOR_406601]: Time Point Study Procedure Months 0-6 • Finalize and submit Institutional Review Board application for approval • Train study staff in study procedures, recruitment, and data collection • Conduct run-in period (n=5) to refine study procedures and intervention Months 7-33 • Enroll and randomly assign up to [ADDRESS_512703] care control • Weekly-meetings of study staff to review study progress and address any study issues Months 34-36 • Complete data analysis and submit manuscripts • Prepare and submit grant proposal for large-scale randomized trial Each subject will be enrolled for approximately 24 weeks total. 8.0 Study Endpoints* 8.1 Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint is feasibility and acceptability as measured by [CONTACT_406648] (>50%), participant retention (>70%), intervention attendance (>70% attending at least 4 of 6 sessions), and intervention satisfaction (>75% reporting average satisfaction greater than the scale’s midpoint). 8.2 Secondary Endpoints: The secondary endpoints of the study are as follows: • Changes in adherence between groups on objective MEMS Caps and self-report MARS-5* at 12-weeks and 24-weeks post-baseline (changes in MEMS Caps adherence will be compared across the entire 24-week period). • Changes in self-reported satisfaction with AET on the CTSQ* between groups at 12-week and 24-weeks post-baseline. • Changes in self-reported symptom distress on the BCPT* between groups at 12-week and 24-weeks post-baseline. Secondary endpoints will also be examined using social support (MSPSS*) and demographic and treatment-related factors (e.g., age, stage, time since AET initiation) as potential covariates. 8.3 Exploratory Endpoints: • Changes in distress levels (HADS*), quality of life (FACT-B*), and medication self-efficacy (SEAMS*) between groups at 10- and 24-weeks post-baseline, as well as potential mediation of secondary and exploratory endpoints through changes in beliefs about adjuvant endocrine therapy (BMQ-AET*), self-efficacy for managing AET symptoms (Self-Efficacy For Symptoms) and/or perceived copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (MOCS*). Potential demographic or treatment related moderators will also be explored (e.g., age, type of AET medication, cognitive functioning [PROMIS*]). *All study instruments are explained in full in Section 9.3. 
 9.0 Procedures Involved* 9.1 Study Design This is a multi-site randomized control trial of a tailored, telehealth intervention (STRIDE) versus standard care plus medication monitoring in up to 105 BCS taking AET (run-in period, n=5; RCT, n=100). To ensure balanced representation between the two study groups, we will stratify randomization by [CONTACT_406649] (high vs. low), determined by [CONTACT_406650] (Appendix 30.8). A participant will be considered high distress if they answer with a score of ≥ 8 on the HADS. Furthermore, participants who self-identify as part of a minority identifying racial/ethnic group will be offered the opportunity to participate in a qualitative exit interview to gather patient feedback on the study’s cultural awareness and relevance. This interview will take approximately 15 minutes. 9.2 The STRIDE Intervention Run-in Period. We will recruit up to 5 early-stage, hormone receptor-positive BCS who meet eligibility criteria to participate in the run-in period of the study, an approach to ensure smooth operation of study procedures.48,49 These participants will complete the entire intervention through the 3-month assessment (see Protocol Schema prior to Table of Contents). Participants will complete acceptability ratings of ease and usefulness (0-10 scale) at each session (Appendix 30.9). Participants will complete an additional STRIDE acceptability measure (including the CSQ) about their experience in the program as a whole after they complete the intervention (Appendix 30.18). At the 3-month assessment, we will conduct individual, semi-structured exit interviews to solicit feedback about the intervention, study procedures, and the assessment battery and ensure acceptability (Appendix 30.10).[ADDRESS_512704] three sessions entail an assessment of patient, treatment, and healthcare system/provider barriers to adherence, followed by [CONTACT_406651]. We will employ specific interventions to target patient-identified barriers. For example, cognitive reframes will be applied to optimize accuracy related to recurrence risk perception and clinical necessity for therapy. Problem-solving will be implemented for management of financial distress (e.g., develop plan with social work and oncology team). To target healthcare system/provider barriers, the protocol will teach assertiveness skills for adopting an active role with clinicians and increasing self-efficacy. The last three tailored sessions will target treatment factors; patients will receive training in symptom management and copi[INVESTIGATOR_406602]. CBT is effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_406603]-related side effects such as pain, fatigue, and menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. CBT strategies will address individual sources of distress, such as difficulty managing symptoms, or financial concerns around medication cost that are interfering with adherence and exacerbating distress. In extenuating circumstances, participants may be scheduled for individual sessions if we cannot schedule them for a group session within a reasonable amount of time.  Participants in the STRIDE intervention will continue to monitor medication-taking with the MEMS Caps throughout the 24-week study period. As part of the intervention, participants will practice relaxation training using study recordings through the study’s website portal 
 (stridestudy.mgh.harvard.edu). The structure of each website post can be viewed in Appendix 30.25. The website will move into production after IRB approval. This is a website created with the support of IT at MGH/HMS and is viewable to those with the link to the website URL. The website will contain no advertisements or other content. It will only contain the relaxation file, and the individual sessions from the work book that the intervention participants receive, so that they can also have an electronic version accessible for the future. Study staff will provide instructions for participants to access this website via email as part of the intervention session reminders (Appendix 30.14). In addition to the overall study PI, [CONTACT_406687], trained clinical psychology practicum students, clinical psychology fellows, licensed psychologists or social workers on the study team at MGH will deliver the intervention, to ensure successful administration of the intervention. Interventionists will complete a post-intervention survey for each group intervention, which will document process variables such as session length, session interventionist, and session attendance. [CONTACT_406687] has ample experience delivering this type of intervention and was a protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_406604]-funded CBT-based studies. She will conduct weekly clinical supervision with trained interventionists. 80% of sessions will be audio-recorded and at least 10% randomly selected, stratified by [CONTACT_406652], and reviewed with [CONTACT_42164] for treatment fidelity. Content fidelity will be assessed by [CONTACT_406653][INVESTIGATOR_406605], with a goal of 90%.51 Feedback will be given to interventionists to enhance adherence to the protocol.    Finally, participants who identify as part of a racial/ethnic minority population will be offered the opportunity to participate in a qualitative exit interview to provide feedback on the STRIDE program.  Medication Monitoring Control. Participants in the comparison condition will not receive the STRIDE intervention; however, they will monitor medication-taking with MEMS Caps and undergo standard care with oncology follow-up. Rationale: Although we considered an attention-matched condition to control for nonspecific intervention effects, we decided against this approach because medication monitoring is likely to improve adherence alone.[ADDRESS_512705] that attention would improve AET adherence, an attention control would be an added expense and unethical.52 Finally, participants who identify as part of a racial/ethnic minority population will be offered the opportunity to participate in a qualitative exit interview to provide feedback on the STRIDE study.  Retention. Strategies to promote retention will include accurate explanations of study expectations during the recruitment process,[ADDRESS_512706] (Appendix 3.12), a phone check-in to ensure use of MEMS Caps, branding of study materials for project identity, and reimbursement for time ($20/assessment). Intervention participants will receive a text reminder one day prior to the scheduled ZOOM session (See Section 5.2 detailing Participant Communication).   9.[ADDRESS_512707] the theoretical intervention targets and aims of the study. All participants will complete the baseline questionnaires within four weeks of documented informed consent. If a participant does not complete the baseline questionnaires within this timeframe, she will be re-screened and re-consented, restarting the four-week window. Follow-up assessments will be completed at 12-week (+/- 2 weeks) and 24-week (+/- 2 weeks) from time of baseline completion (Appendix 30.16) Table 3 details the schedule for administering all study instruments. Patient assessments can be found in Appendix 30.16. We anticipate that 15-20% of 12-week assessments will be out 
 of window for intervention participants, given the occasional delay of coordinating multiple patients’ schedules to arrange the intervention groups.   
Screening: Adapted National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer (Included as part of Study Screening Script in Appendix 30.3 and independently in Appendix 30.17): The NCCN Distress Thermometer is a valid, one-item measure for assessing distress in many cancer populations.54 This Instrument/Measure: Screening Baseline (4-week window from consent) 12-week s post-baseline (+/- 2-week window) *24-weeks post-baseline (+/- 2-week window) Chart review X    Adapted NCCN Distress Thermometer X    Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS Caps)  To be used throughout the 24-week study period Demographics  X   Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5)  X X X Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Checklist (BCPT)  X X X Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ)  X X X Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)  X X X Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-B)  X X X Measure of Current Status (MOCS)  X X X Beliefs About Medications Questionnaire – Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy (BMQ-AET)  X X X Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)  X X X Self-Efficacy in Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS)  X X X Self-Efficacy For Managing Symptoms and Taking AET Questionnaire (Self-Efficacy For Symptoms)  X X X Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) – Cognitive Function – Short Form 4a   X X X Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)**   X  Supplemental Medication Diary To serve as optional as-needed supplement to MEMS Caps (e.g., on vacation) Session Rating Form To be administered during the run-in period after each intervention session  Intervention Acceptability Form To be administered during the run-in period at 3-months post-baseline Semi-structured Exit Interview To be conducted during the run-in period at 3-months post-baseline Semi-structured Exit Interview To be conducting during the RCT period after participants complete their participation in the STRIDE program. *Run-in participants will not complete a 24-week assessment **CSQ will be administered to intervention participants only  
 measure is scored on a range of 0 (no distress at all) to 10 (extremely distressed), and a score of [ADDRESS_512708] cancer symptoms/side effects, and distress related to adherence to AET. Participants who indicate a score of ≥ 4 on any of the three distress thermometers will be eligible for participation.   Secondary Outcomes: Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS Caps):[ADDRESS_512709] and verified by [CONTACT_102]. Adherence will be calculated as the percentage of medication taken of the total prescribed. A total monthly and weekly adherence score will be calculated to examine changes over time.  Supplemental Medication Diary (Appendix 30.23): The Supplemental Medication Diary will be used per participant discretion alongside their use of the MEMS Caps. The diary will allow participants to document any instance in which they take their AET without opening the MEMS Cap. For example, a participant would document use in the diary if they took out two doses to be taken for the next two days, without opening their MEMS again.   Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5): The MARS-5 assesses adherence to treatment and has been used specifically in the context of AET adherence. The scale consists of five items that ask about suboptimal adherence behaviors, such as “I stop taking my adjuvant endocrine therapy medicine for a while.” Each item is answered on a scale of 1 (Always) to 5 (Never).58   Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ): The Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ) is a previously published 21-item measure that evaluates patients’ beliefs about the following aspects of medical care: expectations of the effectiveness of cancer therapy, feelings about side effects, oral cancer therapy adherence, satisfaction with cancer therapy, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_406606], and reasons for non-adherence.[ADDRESS_512710] Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Scale (BCPT): The BCPT is a symptom checklist used to document physical and psychological symptoms associated with ET use.[ADDRESS_512711] week on a scale of 0 (Not at all bothered) to 4 (Extremely bothered).    Exploratory Outcomes:   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS):[ADDRESS_512712] Cancer (FACT-B): The FACT-B is a validated measure used to assess multidimensional quality of life in patients with breast cancer. The measure captures five domains: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional 
 well-being, and additional concerns. Each item is answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much).63   Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS):64 The SEAMS will be used to measure patient self-efficacy in taking medication. The SEAMS was developed specifically for patients with chronic disease taking long-term medication.64 Two factor structures are created: self-efficacy for taking medication under difficult circumstances and under changing circumstances. Each item is answered on a scale of 1 (not confident) to 3 (very confident).  Covariates: EHR Factors: The following information will be collected from participant EHR: MGH Main vs. Affiliate site, health insurance type, breast cancer stage, treatment (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, radiation), ET type, time since treatment completion, menopausal status, psychotropic medications, and medical or psychological co-morbidities.  Demographic Questionnaire: Participants will self-report their age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, and relationship status.  Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS):65 The MSPSS is a validated, reliable scale used to capture levels of perceived social support. The scale consists of 12 items, such as “my family really tries to help me,” and is measured on a 7-point Likert scale.  Potential Mediators Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire – Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy (BMQ-AET):66 The BMQ-AET will be administered to assess beliefs about the need for AET. The BMQ-AET has been used in studies measuring endocrine therapy adherence.67 This study will use one of the two scales, which is computed measuring perceived need for medication and concerns about disruptive medication effects.    Measure of Current Status (MOCS): The MOCS is a 13-item scale which measures patients’ current self-perceived ability on several skills. Examples of targeted content areas are ability to relax, restructure maladaptive thoughts, and choose appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_25133]. Each of the 13 items is answered on a scale of 0 (I cannot do this at all) to 4 (I can do this extremely well).  Self-Efficacy For Managing Symptoms Questionnaire (Self-Efficacy For Symptoms):68 The Self-Efficacy for Symptoms Questionnaire is a modified version of the self-efficacy scale to assess patient self-efficacy in managing symptoms related to their endocrine therapy medication. The measure asks patients to rate their confidence on a scale of 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (very confident) in their ability to decrease or control the side effects of their medication.   Potential Moderator Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) – Cognitive Function – Short Form 4a:69 The PROMIS short-form measure will be used to assess patient-perceived changes in cognitive function.70 The 4-item measure asks patients to response to each statement on a scale from 1 (very often) to 5 (never) over the past 7 days.    Intervention Acceptability: Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ):71 The CSQ is a 3-item, validated measure to assess satisfaction with services provided to the patient, and asks questions such as, “to what extent has our program met 
 your needs?” Each item is answered on a scale of 1-4. This will be administered at the 12-week  assessment to evaluate intervention participants only to examine intervention acceptability.  Run-in participants only: Session Rating Form (Appendix 30.9): This 5-item measure will be given to run-in participants to capture their thoughts and perceptions of the usefulness of each STRIDE intervention session. An example of a question is, “how enjoyable was today’s session?” Each question will be answered on a scale of 1-10.  Intervention Acceptability Measure (30.17): This measure will be given to run-in participants only at the 10-week post-baseline question. The goal of this measure is to capture participant thoughts and experiences having gone through the STRIDE Intervention. An example of an item is “how satisfied are you with the number of sessions (5) that you received?” and is to be answered on a scale of 1 (quite dissatisfied) to 4 (very satisfied).  Semi-Structured Interview (Appendix 30.10): At the end of the run-in period, participants will complete a brief semi-structured interview to assess the STRIDE Intervention. This interview will be conducted with a study staff member not involved with the delivery of the intervention and will be used to inform and adapt the STRIDE Intervention for the RCT.  Semi-Structured Interview (Appendix 30.11): At the end of the RCT period, participants who identify as part of a racial/ethnic minority population will complete a brief semi-structured interview to assess the STRIDE Intervention. This interview will be conducted with a study staff member not involved with the delivery of the intervention and will be used to inform and adapt the STRIDE Intervention for the next phase of the study to increase its cultural awareness and relevance.  9.4 Data Collection Participants will be given the option to complete the above instruments either on paper or over a secure REDCap portal. Study staff will send assessments to participants at the start of their timepoint window and will follow-up periodically throughout to ensure receipt and completion of assessments. Assessments that are completed on paper will be entered into the secure REDCap database by [CONTACT_464]. Patients assigned to the intervention arm will additionally receive a copy of the Intervention Manual, a welcome letter with study expectations (Appendix 30.11), and a study timeline document (Appendix 30.15) to better their understanding of what time points to expect throughout the study. Patients randomized to the usual care arm will follow standard care of [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111455]. They will also receive a study timeline document (Appendix 30.15). 10.0 Data and Specimen Banking: Not applicable 11.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality 11.1 Data Analysis To determine feasibility in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (N=100), estimate effect size, and finalize the intervention and study protocol to plan a full-scale, adequately powered efficacy trial.  Power calculation. The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_406607], defined as (1) enrollment rate > 50%, (2) retention rate > 70%, and (3) attendance rate ≥ 70% (i.e. ≥ 70% of participants complete at least 4 of 6 sessions). At the time of the original protocol approval, we 
 estimated an accrual goal of 80 ([ADDRESS_512713] and 5 in run-in phase) participants; therefore, the following power estimates are based on that number. We estimated that the enrollment rate will be 60%. If [ADDRESS_512714], one-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated enrollment rate will be 53%. Furthermore, we anticipate that the retention and attendance rates will both be 80%, and with [ADDRESS_512715], one-sided 95% confidence interval for the retention and attendance rates will be 71%. Thus, based on our estimates of the feasibility parameters, the study will demonstrate feasibility of the adherence intervention. We have now expanded our accrual goal to 100 participants, which serves to only increase our power and rates of enrollment, retention, and attendance.  Primary Aim. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a tailored, small-group, Telehealth intervention (STRIDE) compared to a medication monitoring control for survivors of breast cancer taking adjuvant endocrine therapy.  Hypothesis 1: The study will be feasible, defined by [CONTACT_193531] (enrollment rate > 50%), retention (completion rate of follow-up assessments > 70% of all participants who complete baseline) and attendance (attendance rate of at least 70% of participants completing at least 4 of 6 sessions [60%]).  Hypothesis 2: The study will be acceptable demonstrated by >75% of participants reporting average satisfaction scores greater than the scale’s mid-point (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire).  Secondary Aim. To assess effects of the STRIDE intervention on adherence to AET, symptom distress, and satisfaction with AET. Hypothesis 1. We hypothesize that participation in the STRIDE intervention will be associated with an increase in adherence and satisfaction with AET and a decrease in symptom distress at 12-weeks compared to the medication monitoring control, and that these improvements will maintain at 24-week follow-up.   Data will be assessed for patterns of missingness72 and statistical assumptions. We will conduct mixed effects models with repeated measures data and relevant covariates such social support (MSPSS) and demographic and treatment-related factors (e.g., age, stage, time since AET initiation) as potential covariates. Longitudinal analyses will include all time points and a cross-sectional analysis for each time point. Given that this pi[INVESTIGATOR_102905], we will examine mean differences and sample variability. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) will be calculated for changes in outcomes from baseline to four and eight months, as (Mean change score [intervention arm] – Mean change score [control arm])/SD pooled, where 0.[ADDRESS_512716] a full-scale efficacy trial with power >80%. We will also verify the needed sample size based on ability to detect a clinically meaningful difference and references to existing literature.74   Exploratory Aim. To assess the effects of the STRIDE intervention on several psychosocial constructs, exploring potential mediator and moderators of the intervention. Exploratory Hypothesis: We will explore whether participation in the STRIDE intervention is associated with an increase in QOL and medication-taking self-efficacy, and a decrease in distress (anxiety and depression at 12-weeks compared to the medication monitoring control, and whether these improvements are maintained at 24-week follow-up. We will use the same procedure to assess changes in secondary outcomes in the intervention group. We will explore potential mediation of secondary and exploratory endpoints through changes in beliefs about adjuvant endocrine therapy (BMQ-AET) and/or perceived copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (MOCS), as well as self-efficacy for managing symptoms (Self-Efficacy For Symptoms). 
 Potential demographic or treatment related moderators will also be explored (e.g., age, type of AET medication, cognitive functioning [PROMIS]). We will conduct moderated regressions to examine whether a group difference in adherence is moderated by [CONTACT_654], social support (MSPSS), employment status, menopausal status, medication type, or other patient/treatment factors. We will explore alternative models using dichotomous outcomes over time.  Findings will inform the planning of an R01 to evaluate the efficacy of a videoconference, tailored intervention in improving ET adherence for BCS. If the current study is not found to be feasible or acceptable, we will have acquired valuable information to proceed in the identification of a patient-centered intervention for BCS. For example, feedback from the final assessment can be used to modify the intervention, such as the addition of a systems-based intervention component if findings show that low health literacy or cost barriers influence intervention effects. Differences in adherence, feasibility, or acceptability based on demographic or clinical characteristics can help determine which individuals may benefit. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the understanding of BCS’ needs related to ET. Future studies based on these findings have the potential to influence survivorship care plans, and videoconferencing is a modality that can be widely disseminated. Improved adherence to ET may prevent recurrence and mortality, extending the lives of BCS. 11.[ADDRESS_512717] (HIPAA) requirements, and applicable Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Standard Operating Procedures. General Approach: We have developed a comprehensive data and safety monitoring plan for the proposed project. Throughout the award period, weekly meetings will take place with the research team: Jennifer Temel, MD and Joseph Greer, PhD, and study staff (clinical research coordinator [CRC] and interventionist). Specifically, meetings will include ongoing review of study protocol, assessment procedures, and issues related to recruitment, data collection, and management. Study staff will also discuss any human subject issues that arise. General Roles and Responsibilities: We will use several coordinated strategies to monitor study recruitment, enrollment, and retention, as described in the following table. We will also closely track collection of patient-reported assessments, as these measures are an essential aspect of our study procedures and outcomes. For all strategies identified in the table, we will develop study tracking forms that will be reviewed at the weekly team meetings. Study tracking forms will be used to create a record of all decisions made and actions taken. I will send a report ahead of the meeting detailing study progress and setting the agenda. The following monitoring and reporting steps will be taken for each study activity: Study Activity Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism Recruitment • The designated CRC will generate a weekly report outlining the number of patients approached and reasons for ineligibility or 
 disinterest in study participation Informed Consent • The CRC will generate a weekly report detailing the number of participants who signed informed consent. • The PI [INVESTIGATOR_406608] • The CRC will generate a weekly enrollment report Assessments • The CRC will conduct a review for completeness and accurate data entry.  • The CRC will conduct regular checks of MEMS Caps adherence data and contact [CONTACT_406654]-up to verify use of MEMS Caps. • The CRC will maintain participant records of distress levels at each timepoint and follow Reaction Management if required. Intervention • The CRC will contact [CONTACT_406655]. • The PI [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. Greer (Study Co-Investigator, PI [CONTACT_15957]-Mentor) will review at least 10% of audio-recorded treatment sessions. • The CRC will maintain a record of participant progress in sessions, including attendance. Retention • The CRC will generate a weekly report detailing completion of follow-up assessments and retention strategies implemented for each participant. • The CRC will generate a weekly report of all participants who withdraw from study. Analysis • The PI [INVESTIGATOR_406609], Nora Horick (scientific advisor in biostatistics), on all qualitative and quantitative analyses. Specific PI [INVESTIGATOR_406610] I will be responsible for all aspects of conducting the protocol; I will: • Oversee the coordination, development, submission, and approval of the protocol to the DF/HCC as well as subsequent amendments. • Ensure that the investigators and study team members are qualified and appropriately resourced to conduct the protocol. • Carry out a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan as detailed in this document. • Ensure that each participating study team member receives adequate protocol training prior to enrolling participants and throughout the trial’s conduct as needed. • Monitor progress and overall conduct of the study. • Conduct review of 10% of intervention sessions for process and content fidelity. • Conduct weekly supervision for clinical protocol interventionists. • Review data and maintain timely submission of data for study analysis. • Ensure compliance with all requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, DF/HCC, HIPAA requirements, and the approved protocol. • Commit to provisions that the protocol will not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_406656]. • Monitor accrual and address concerns if accrual goals are not met. The [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406611], the protocol and HIPAA requirements. Specifically, it will: • Oversee the data collection process. 
 • Maintain documentation of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) reports and deviations/violations. • Maintain regulatory documents which include but are not limited to the following: IRB approvals/notifications, confirmation of Federalwide Assurances (FWAs), all SAE submissions, screening logs, and IRB approved consents. • Conduct regular communications with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_406612]. • Document the delegation of research specific activities to study personnel. • Maintain regulatory files. • Have office space, office equipment, and internet access that meet HIPAA standards. • Participate in quality assurance activities and meet with monitors or auditors at the conclusion of a visit to review findings. • Promptly provide follow-up and/or corrective action plans for any monitoring queries or audit findings.  Informed Consent Requirements. The DF/HCC approved informed consent document will serve as a template for the informed consent.  Protocol Confidentiality. All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participants are strictly confidential. Confidentiality is assured as participants will be identified on all study materials only by [CONTACT_38741], visit number, and date of visit. By [CONTACT_46773], the information can be considered 'de-identified,' and therefore compliant with the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information ("Privacy Rule") of HIPAA. Participants data will be kept in a computer file that is password protected and this password will be changed whenever the staff changes. This password-protected file will be stored on the encrypted MGH network drive on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406613]. Only the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_406614]. We will keep a link between participant number and participant’s name [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a separate file, also password protected (with a different password).  Data Management Organizational Structure Data. Study forms will undergo a systematic and rigorous editing process prior to being keyed into the database. The research assistant will routinely evaluate the data and discuss any problems and questions with the study staff, myself, and mentors at the regular weekly team meetings. Data management formal reports on record status across the three following domains will be employed: entered, verified, and edited. These reports of data records will be evaluated once a month during the final team meeting of the month. All study data (including data from the Electronic Health Record) will be stored on the encrypted MGH network drive on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406615]. To ensure data protection, backup copi[INVESTIGATOR_406616].  Data Safety and Monitoring Plan. The following procedures will be followed, in compliance with NIH requirements, to ensure the safety of study participants and the validity and integrity of data:  • Data Repository: The MGH Cancer Outcomes Research Program (CORe) has coordinated research initiatives over the past ten years that have established procedures and technologies for data collection and management. I will oversee all aspects of data collection for the study and the research assistant will have the operational responsibility of data management. We will develop a study specific data management protocol and standard operating procedures for the creation and testing of all study forms, data collection, quality control, and data extraction. These forms will be standardized. We will provide ongoing oversight of data management throughout the study, and will be responsible for generating reports and datasets for quality control and data analysis. All data management activities will utilize REDCap, a HIPAA-secure, web-based survey application for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_310017], Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) group. REDCap provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data and have real 
 time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of entry. Data management reports will be generated weekly and discussed during the study team meetings.  • Serious Adverse Events: Expedited review will occur for all events meeting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of a SAE (i.e., any fatal event, immediately life-threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event requiring or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Unanticipated Problems [UPs], or any congenital anomaly). This also includes any event that a study investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. For purposes of this study, all SAEs will be required to be reported to the PI, the DF/HCC IRB, and federal agencies (National Cancer Institute, FDA, and the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities), regardless of any judgment of their relatedness to the study. All relevant information will be reported to the study investigators for each SAE including information about the event and its outcome, study condition, concomitant medications, the subject’s medical history and current conditions, and all relevant laboratory data. Notification by [CONTACT_102949] e-mail of all related study forms shall be made to the DF/HCC IRB within 24 hours of the occurrence of any SAE. Information will be reviewed and a determination made of whether there was any possible relevance to the study interventions. Reporting to NIH will be made according to their respective regulations governing SAE reporting. • Non-Serious Adverse Events: At weekly meetings, the research team will discuss summaries of the numbers and rates of adverse events by [CONTACT_1570]. These reports will include types of events, severity, and treatment phase. • Other Safety-Related Reports: At weekly meetings, the research team will discuss summary reports of treatment retention and reasons for dropout or withdrawal by [CONTACT_1570]. • Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: We do not have a pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_406617]-risk nature of the proposed study. However, if at any point the DF/HCC or the study investigators judge that the risks of study procedures outweighs the benefits, the project will be stopped immediately. • Procedures to ensure confidentiality, preparation of reports, minutes, and recommendations: We will work with the CRC to prepare study reports and circulate them to research team during the weekly scheduled project meetings. These reports will include overall study progress and safety data. At the conclusion of each research group meeting, the investigators will determine whether any changes in the conduct of the trial are recommended.  13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects We do not anticipate that any research participants will be withdrawn from the research study without their consent. If a participant requests to withdraw from the study, we will ask if they are comfortable sharing the reason for withdrawing to ensure that there are no necessary serious adverse events to report to the IRB. Subsequently, we will ask the participant if they are still willing to permit the study team to continue to access their EHR. 14.0 Risks to Subjects 14.1 Reporting Adverse or Unanticipated Events We do not anticipate any harm with our study procedures. While some topi[INVESTIGATOR_406618], no adverse or unanticipated events occurred in previous studies of psychological interventions conducted by [CONTACT_116225]. Reportable adverse events would include a breach of confidentiality. Should adverse or unanticipated events occur during the study, a trained study staff member will report the events to the IRB as soon as they are discovered. 14.2 Anticipated Reaction As this is a low-risk, social/behavioral study, there are no ingested medications, and no biomedical procedures. It is unlikely that participants will be at any risk for physical harm because of study participation. Participants may find some of questions in the questionnaire or 
 content in the intervention to be emotionally upsetting, and if so, they may experience some distress. 14.[ADDRESS_512718] in the Psychiatric Oncology Service at the MGH Cancer Center to help address their distress. For all participant assessments given throughout the study, study staff will review assessments upon receipt from participants for completion and to assess distress. On the HADS, patients who endorse ≥11 on even items for a more severe range for depression will be called by [CONTACT_114007] (e.g., [CONTACT_406687], a licensed clinical psychologist, [CONTACT_42164], a licensed clinical psychologist, Amy Corveleyn, a licensed clinical social worker, as well as qualified clinical psychology practicum students and fellows). If a participant completes the distress assessment online through the secure REDCap portal, a study staff member will check the responses and notify the PI [CONTACT_20687]-up if needed within 72 hours of assessment completion. If a participant completes assessments on paper, study staff will check the responses and notify the PI [CONTACT_20687]-up if needed within 72 hours of receipt. If the patient needs further outpatient services for depression, including pharmacotherapy, or is at risk for self-harm requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], study staff will make the necessary referrals for treatment. For example, for patients who are distressed but in no danger to self or others, study staff will refer either to the MGH Oncology Social Work Service or to the MGH Outpatient Psychiatry Department ([PHONE_8392]), including the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Program. If suicidality or risk of harm to others is otherwise discovered at any study visit, the participant will be referred to appropriate services. Specifically, in the case that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029], study staff will contact [CONTACT_406657] ([PHONE_8393]), with the aid of the MGH Police & Security if necessary ([PHONE_8394]). If a referral for outpatient services is made, or the patient requires escort to the MGH Acute Psychiatry Service, study staff will notify the health care team, including the primary oncologist.  15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects* Challenges associated with AET, including side effects, distress, or difficulties with adherence, are common among BCS. We anticipate the STRIDE Intervention will provide potential benefit to participants by [CONTACT_406658]. The intervention was directly informed by [CONTACT_406659]-centered. Additionally, run-in period feedback will be used to further inform the intervention for maximum benefit for participants in the RCT. The risk from participation in the study is small (and will be minimized by [CONTACT_406660]), and the overall risk to benefit ratio is favorable. 16.0 Vulnerable Populations: Not applicable 
 17.0 Community-Based Participatory Research: Not applicable  18.[ADDRESS_512719] of study results. 19.0 Setting 19.1 Location As previously stated in recruitment and enrollment procedures (Section 5.1), participants will be approached in-person in the MGH Center for Breast Oncology outpatient clinic in the Yawkey Center for Outpatient Care or called after receiving permission from their care team. Participants from other sites will be contact[CONTACT_65312]. Upon approach, in-person or over the phone, study staff will ensure complete confidentiality of all study information and procedures.  20.[ADDRESS_512720] at MGH and participating institutions. She will be meeting with the CRC on weekly basis (and more often as urgent issues arise) to ensure the study process is being followed accurately and to address potential challenges or issues as they may arise. [CONTACT_406687] is a member of the MGH Cancer Outcomes Research Program (CORe).  CORe has extensive experience conducting multi-site randomized clinical trials of supportive care interventions in oncology and has the necessary expertise to ensure the success of the proposed project. 20.[ADDRESS_512721] up to 40% will have poor adherence and between 20-25% will have distress. Patients will screen in if they are experiencing distress related to AET, adherence, or side effects, they would be eligible for the study; therefore, we estimate the number of eligible patients may range from 104-208 patients per year. 21.0 Prior Approvals: Not applicable 22.0 Recruitment Methods As described in Section 5.0, all recruitment methods will be centrally located and executed by [CONTACT_406661], MGH [LOCATION_011]. Recruitment strategies include EHR screening, the Partners Rally Recruitment Portal, and Provider Referral.  As detailed in Section 26.0, participants will be provided with compensation of up to $60 total ($20/assessment) throughout the study for their time to complete study assessments (Appendix 30.19). 23.[ADDRESS_512722] a goal of 75 participants. The overall study accrual goal will be up to 105 participants (run-in, n=5, RCT n=100). 24.[ADDRESS_512723] the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
 As detailed in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (Section 12.0), all subjects will receive a confidential number identifier. All participants will be identified on study assessments by [CONTACT_406662]. Identifiers, such as name, will only be used during the initial data retrieval process and can be destroyed once all data records have been obtained and data analysis has been completed as discussed previously. 25.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury We do not anticipate any research-related injury due to involvement in this supportive care trial  26.0 Economic Burden to Subjects Participants will not endure any additional costs as part of their participation in this research study. As such, we do not anticipate any financial burden on study participants. The study intervention visits will not be billed. Additionally, study participants will be compensated for their time to complete the three study questionnaire batteries (baseline, 12-weeks post-baseline, and 24-weeks post-baseline). Participants will be compensated up to $60 ($20/assessment completed) in the form of a check (Appendix 30.19). 27.0 Consent Process As stated previously, study staff will consent patients either in-person or over the phone using study scripts. We will follow all the requirements of SOP: Informed Consent Process (CON-100) in obtaining informed consent for study participants. Electronic Informed Consent Process (EIC): In the event that a potentially eligible patient expresses interest over the phone but will not be in clinic in the near future or receives care at an MGH-affiliate site, study staff will begin the EIC process. Patients will be asked to provide verbal permission and a preferred email address to be sent an email with a link through REDCap (Appendix 30.20). The REDCap link will direct patients to an encrypted REDCap portal; the Electronic/Paperless Consent Template Project will be used. Screen captures of what the EIC REDCap portal looks like are included in Appendix 30.21. This process begins with the patient verifying their date of birth and full name [CONTACT_406678]. Additionally, this portal will have the electronic (paperless) consent form, exactly identical in content to the paper version, to guide the patient through the consent discussion with study staff over the phone. At any point, if a patient would prefer to receive a hard copy of the consent form, the EIC process will stop and study staff will send the patient two copi[INVESTIGATOR_406619] a prepaid envelope to send it back. The patient will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and take their time to consider their participation. From there, patients will digitally sign and date the consent form. The study staff will then sign and date the consent form as the consenting investigator and send a digital or paper copy of the signed consent form per the participant’s preference, sent via Send Secure email if digitally or informed and given the opportunity to opt-out of Send Secure using the Partners Send Secure opt-out language. This process has been found to be highly efficient among other psychosocial research studies, including DF/HCC Protocol #17-201 which directly informed this study, and minimizes burden to patients, study staff, and providers. Enrollment Procedures. DF/HCC institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) Oncore as required by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC SOP REGIST-101. Registration must occur prior to the initiation of protocol-specific procedures or assessments.   For registration of patients from DF/HCC institutions, which will be all participants in this study, study staff will complete the DF/HCC protocol-specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment 
 documented in the participant’s EHR and/or research chart. Study staff will confirm that the participant meets all inclusion criteria as described in this protocol and the criteria on the eligibility checklist. Study staff will be responsible for self-randomization of participants (Biostatistician-generated Randomization Scheme: Appendix 30.8) per ODQ request to decentralize non-therapeutic studies under the DF/HCC. MGH study staff will follow DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101) and register the participant on the protocol.   28.[ADDRESS_512724] the original source document. The study staff member scanning documents will be kept as consistent as possible throughout the duration of the study to ensure uniformity among source documentation handling. Location, time, and date of the scanning of the document will be recorded at the time of scanning. Study staff will fill out the Source Documentation Certified Copy Cover Sheet (Appendix 30.22) and include this as the first page of the electronic version of the source document. After the source document is scanned and the corresponding electronic document is confirmed to be legible, all facing the correct direction, and together as a single document, it will be collected and destroyed immediately. Study staff will destroy the original copy of the source document by [CONTACT_406663] (PHI). Electronic versions of source documents will allow study staff to access these documents regardless of where the original copy is stored, which may be inconvenient, increase study staff burden, and study cost if storage of documents is far from the location where research activities will be conducted or required to be placed in long term storage. This process has been developed streamlined, and successfully implemented in DF/HCC Protocol #17-201. If a patient is consented electronically, the completed version of their digital consent form will be saved as the completed, original source document and no certified copy cover sheet will be used.  29.0 Drugs or Devices: Not Applicable

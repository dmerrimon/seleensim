Objectives  
Primary Objective:  
• Evaluate the efficacy , defined as overall response rate (ORR), of bb2121 in subjects 
with relapsed  and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Assess additional efficacy outcomes, including complete response (CR)  rate, time to 
response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), progression- free survival (PFS), time to 
progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS)  
• Assess the safety of bb2121 in subjects with RRMM 
• Characterize the expansion of c himeric antigen r eceptor ( CAR) + T cells in the 
peripheral blood (cellular kinetics - pharmacokinetics [PK])  
• Evaluate the development of an anti-CAR antibody response 
• Evaluate the proportion of subjects who attain minimal residual disease (MRD)  
negative status by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS)  
• Describe changes in health related quality of life (HRQoL) using the European 
Organization fo r Research and Treatment of Cancer  – Quali ty of Life C30 
quest ionnaire (EORTC- QLQ-C30), the Europea n Quali ty of Life-5 Dimension s 
health state classifier to 5 Level s (EQ-5D-5L) and the European Quality of Life 
Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC -QLQ- MY20)  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• Characterize the expansion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) + T cells in the bone 
marrow  
• Evaluate the immuno phenotype of bb2121 CAR T and endogenous T cells in the 
blood, bone marrow and/or tumor tissue  
• Evaluate cytokine/chemokine induction in the blood of subjects after infusion of bb2121  
• Evaluate the percentage of B -cell maturation antigen (BCMA)- expressing (BCMA+) 
cells and levels of BCMA expression in bone marrow, and the level of circulating soluble BCMA  
• Evaluate me chanisms of tumor sensitivity/resistance to bb2121

efficacy and safety of bb2121 in subjects with RRMM.  
The study will enroll up to 140 subjects ( up to 119  subjects treated with bb2121) with RRMM to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bb2121.   Pre-treatment:  
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will undergo screening procedures to 
determine eligibility.  After screening eligibility  has been met , subjects will be enrolled and 
undergo leukapheresis to enable bb2121 product generation. Subjects may receive bridging 
multiple myeloma (MM ) therapy following leukapheresis as long as the last dose is administered 
≥ 14 days prior to initiation of lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy.    
Bridging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798531], alkylating agents, immunomodulatory agents, 
proteasome inhibitors, and/or anti -CD38 antibodies as single agents or in combination.  
Experimental agents and myeloma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798532]. In subjects who receive bridging myeloma 
therapy, baseline disease staging assessments need to be repeated following completion of 
bridging therapy and prior to starting LD chemotherapy. 
Treatment : 
Subjects eligible for treatment will receive [ADDRESS_1101460] and bb2121 infusion 
on Day 0.   
bb2121 will be administered at a dose ranging from 150 to 450 x 10
6 CAR+ T cells/infusion .  
Subjects must be admitted for inpatient monitoring  from D ay [ADDRESS_1101461]-bb2121 
infusion, to monitor the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_798533] ( CRS ) and neurotoxicity.  
Post-treatment:  
Safety, myeloma response, disease status, bb2121 expansion and persistence, utility values 
measured using the EORTC- QLQ-C30, EQ -5D- 5L and EORTC -QLQ-MY20 questionnaires , and 
other secondary and exploratory endpoints  will be assessed  on all subjects  for a minimum of 24-
months from bb2121 infusion or until documented disease progression (PD) , whichever is 
longer. Subjects with documented PD within 24-months of bb2121 infusion will remain on the 
study and have select assessments collected  until M24. 
Retreatment  
Retreatment with a second infusion of bb2121, including a second course of LD chemotherapy, with or without bridging therapy,  may be considered if protocol specified eligibility criteria are

• The pre- treatment period of the study will consist of screening for eligibility, 
leukapheresis and baseline evaluations (prior to LD chemotherapy). 
• The treatment period will start with LD chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_798606]2121 infusion

• The post- treatment period will consist of efficacy and safety follow -up visits monthly 
until month 6, then every [ADDRESS_1101464] the medical monitor for discussion. The reason for discontinuation will be documented.  
Upon discontinuation from this study, all subjects who received bb2121 will participate in a 
separate long term follow -up (LTFU)  study, to be monitored for delayed toxicities related t o 
bb2121, viral vector safety, disease status, quality of life, survival status, and subsequent anti-
MM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Subjects will be monitored in the LTFU study for up to [ADDRESS_1101465] that is 
required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.  
The study will have an Independent Response Committee (IRC) who will review  data for 
response assessment.  The IRC will determine the response to therapy based on the IMWG Uniform Respons e Criteria  for each subject.  
The study will have an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) who will monitor the study data in an ongoing manner.

Study Procedures and Treatments  
Once screening eligibility has been met, a leukapheresis collection will be performed on each 
subject to obtain a sufficient quantity of peripheral blood mononuclear c ells (PBMCs) for the 
production of bb2121.  
If necessary, selected anti -myeloma  bridging treatment is allowed while bb2121 is being 
manufactured, for disease control, as long as the last dose is administered ≥ [ADDRESS_1101466] eroids, alkylating agents, immunomodulatory agents , proteasome inhibitors, 
and/or anti-CD38 antibodies as single agents or in combination.  Experimental agents and 
myeloma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798534].  In subjects who receive bridging myeloma therapy, select baseline evaluations 
for disease staging are repeated following completion of bridging therapy and prior to starting LD chemotherapy. 
Subjects will receive three days of fludarabine intravenously (IV) (30 mg/m
2) and 
cyclophosphamide IV (300 mg/m2) for LD chemotherapy starting on D ay -5. After the  
completion of LD chemotherapy, bb2121 will be administered as an  IV in fusion at a dose 
ranging from 150 – 450 x 106 CAR+ T  cells on Day 0 .

1.1. Disease Background  
1.1.1. Multiple Myeloma and C urrent T herapi[INVESTIGATOR_798535] (M M) is a rare and incurable plasma cell neoplasm characterized by [CONTACT_798607], bone lesions, hypercalcemia and bone marrow (BM) suppression 
resulting from excessive production of monoclonal proteins as well as direct tumor cell effects. 
MM accounts for approximately 10 % to 15% of all hematologic malignancies and primarily 
affects older individuals – it is extremely rare in patients less than 30 years old  (Kumar, 2017; 
Moreau, 2013) .  Multiple myeloma  is at the aggressive end of a spectrum of diseases referred to 
as plasma cell dyscrasias (PCD) and is often preceded for months/years by [CONTACT_798608] (MGUS) ( Rajkumar, 
2016). Data from GLOBOCAN in 2012 estimate a global incidence of 114,000 patients with 
80,000 deaths ( Ferlay, 2015).  
Dramatic progress has been made in the treatment of MM patients and median survival in 
randomized clinical trials can now extend past 7 years ( Attal, 2016). This increase in survival has 
been driven by [CONTACT_798609], immunomodulatory agents (IMiD) and dexamethasone coupled with consolidation using autologous stem cell transplantation  (ASCT)  (Kumar, 2017; Moreau, 2013; 
Rajkumar, 2016). Unfortunately, even with optimal up- front therapy the vast majority of MM 
patients relapse and further treatment is needed. For these RRMM patients, treatment options have also improved over time. With the introduction of newer classes of approved anti- myeloma 
agents, i ncluding monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab and elotuzumab), advanced generation 
proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib, ixazomib), immunomodulatory compound (pomalidomide) 
and histone deacetylase inhibitors (pan obinostat), RR MM patients can  expect some degree of 
response ( Botta, 2017 ).  Many of these newer agents received full approval based on 
progression- free survival  (PFS)  benefits in randomized trials (carfilzomib, ixazomib, 
panobinostat and elotuzumab) but conditional approval was granted for daratumumab based on 
two trials showing overall response rates (ORR) ranging from 29% to 36% in RRMM 
subjects ( Darzalex, 2017 ). This underscores the benefit of these newer agents in the treatment of 
a heavily refractory myeloma population and the desire to expedite novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798536] 
a relevant measure of reduction of tumor burden and based on its correlation to standard 
approval outcomes such as progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) ( Lonial, 
2015).  Although effective, these salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798537] (CR) rates for combination regimens that include daratumumab, ixazomib, 
panobinostat or elotuzumab of less than 25%  (Dimopoulos, 2016; Lonial, 2015; Moreau, 2016; 
Palumbo, 2016; San -Miguel, 2014).  This highlights the need for potentially curative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798538].  
1.1.2. Immunotherapy in O ncology 
Immunotherapy aims to leverage a series of complex interactions between malignant cells and the immune system where surveillance is a critical mechanism for restraining tumor development 
and one that is exploited in malignancy ( Chen, 2013) . As an example, dramatic remissions have 
been observed using immunotherapeutics such as checkpoint inhibitors in advanced

cells ( Jung, 2017). All of these approaches are in various stages of clinical development. Given 
impressive efficacy and acceptable safety profiles in other hematologic malignancies, including 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia  (Kalos, 2011; Kochenderfer, 2015; Maude, 2014) , engineered chimeric antigen 
receptor T cells (CAR T cells) have the potential to shift the treatment paradigm in MM. CAR T 
cells are genetically engineered autologous ex vivo cultured T cells that contain a CAR 
composed of an antigen- recognizing single c hain variable fragment fused to a transmembrane 
domain and then to an intracellular region comprised of costimulatory and T -cell activation 
domains ( Chang, 2017). 
1.2. Product Background 
bb2121 is defined as an autologous T lymphocyte -enriched population that contains cells 
transduced with an anti- BCMA02 chimeric antigen receptor lentiviral vector encoding a 
chimeric antigen receptor targeting human B cell maturation antigen .  
Anti-BCMA02 CAR lentiviral vector is used to transduce autologous T cells. This vector uses 
the murine leukemia virus-derived myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhanced promoter (MND ) 
to drive expression of the chimeric receptor, a multi -domain protein consisting of the 
extracellular antigen recognition domain (V L and V H), the CD8α hinge domain, a transmembrane 
domain (CD8 TM), and the intracellular CD137 co- stimulatory (4 -1BB) and CD3zeta chain 
signaling domains.  
Preclinical pharmacology of bb2121 showed desirable specificity against BCMA and potent 
activity of the CAR T cells leading to rapid and complete elimination of BCMA expressing 
tumors. In vitro, bb2121 was cytotoxic against a range of MM cell lines with va rying levels of 
BCMA expression and this activity was not inhibited by [CONTACT_798610]. There was no tonic signaling of bb2121 in the absence of BCMA 
target engagement and no in vitro cytotoxicity induced in cell lines lacking BCMA, underscoring 
the specificity of bb2121 for BCMA-expressing target cells. In vivo models showed a selective and higher anti -tumor activity of bb2121 in comparison to bortezomib in treatment of immune-
deficient mice with large established  BCMA- expressing tumors with complete remission and 
survival rates as high as 100% in mice after a single dose of bb2121.

Confidential and Proprietary 21 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment 4.0 Final: 1 8 Jul 2019  1.3. Rationale  
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for BCMA as a Target for CAR T Therapy  
Similar to the use of anti -CD19 CAR T cells to treat CD19 -expressing tumors,  BCMA is  a 
potential target for CAR T cells in MM for several reasons. First, BCMA is consistently 
expressed on plasma cells and myeloma cells from MM patients and is thought to provide protection for myeloma cells in the bone marrow niche  (Carpenter, 2013 ; Novak, 2004). Second, 
BCMA expression increases with disease progression and soluble BCMA in serum acts as a prognostic factor for survival and indicator of response to therapy ( Sanchez, 2012) . Finally, 
BCMA has limited distribution in normal non- hematopoietic tissue. Reports have demonstrated 
BCMA expression on differentiated plasma cells and a subset of mature B cells in normal lymphoid tissue (eg, bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and tonsil) but lack of expression on naïve B cells, other hematopoietic cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells or other 
non hemato- lymphoid tissues  (Carpenter, 2013) . Plasma cell -restricted expression was further 
supported in a recent nonclinical report describing a BCMA -targeting therapeutic antibody, in 
which specific cytolysis of BCMA -expressing (BCMA+) MM cells was observed after in vitro 
co-culture with this antibody while sparing normal bone marrow and other immune cells ( Tai, 
2014).  
Given the nearly uniform expression of BCMA in MM (ranging from ~ 40 0 to 4000 receptors 
per cell) and the low level of target expression observed in nonclinical models sufficient to 
trigger bb2121 activation in response to BCMA+ target cell engagement (< 250 receptors per cell) (Lee, 2016)
, restriction of the treated population in both the clinical and marketing setting to 
a BCMA-positive subset of MM is not planned.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for the Study Design 
Treatment options for RRMM have expanded greatly in the past several years and encompass advanced generation immunomodulatory compounds, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal 
antibodies, histone modulators and alkylating chemotherapy. The CR rate for many of these  
drugs when administered in combination can approach 25% but leaves a significant fraction of 
patients with suboptimal remissions. Deep responses in this patient population including minimal residual disease (MRD ) negative states are rare.  
In an ongoing P hase [ADDRESS_1101482]-in-human clinical trial of bb2121 (CRB-401) in RR MM subjects, 
encouraging preliminary efficacy results have been observed with an acceptable safety  profile . In 
this study, subj ects with heavily pretreated RR MM (with high BCMA expression) were treated 
with escalating doses (5 0, 150, 450, 800 x 10
6 CAR+ T cells) of bb2121 following 
lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.  The dose escalation and initial expansion phase of this trial is completed and includes an expansion cohort in approximately [ADDRESS_1101483] 2 response 
assessments or with progressive disease, treated at dose levels greater than or equal to  150 x 10

16 responding subjects evaluable  for minimal residual disease (MRD) status, all 16  subjects 
(100%) were MRD negative.  The principal toxicity observed was cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in 27 of 43 (63%) treated subjects which was mild to moderate in the majority of subjects 
with only two cases of transient G rade 3 CRS. No  dose- limiting toxicities  were observed  during 
dose escalation   (Raje, 2018).  Neurotoxicity of any grade was observed in 14 of 43 (33%) 
subjects including one reversible grade 4 event (2.3%) and no grade 3 events.  The o ne serious 
adverse event  (SAE)  of reversible Grade 4 neurotoxicity associated with tumor lysis syndrome

Another P hase 1 trial is ongoing at the National Cancer Institute with BCMA -targeted CAR T 
cells including the same anti-BCMA binding domain, but with a CD28 rather than 4- 1BB 
costimulatory domain.  This trial has also reported deep and durable (> 24 weeks) remiss ions in 
heavily pre- treated RR MM patients with high BCMA expression, but with dose- limiting G rade 
3/4 CRS in 2 of 2 patients treated at 9 x 10
6 CAR+ T cells/kg  (Kochenderfer, 2016) .  
In addition, preliminary results of a third clinical program of BCMA -targeted CAR T cells 
(different anti- BCMA binder with a 4 -1BB costimulatory domain) at the University of 
Pennsylvania reported clinical responses in 3 of 10 subjects with RR MM treated at a dose of 1  to 
5 x 106 CAR+ T cells/kg in the absence of lymphodepletion, with one sCR ongoing at 12 months 
and one VGPR followed by [CONTACT_798611] 5 months, suggestive of antigen loss escape. CRS was reported in 8 of 9 (89%) subjects including 2 G rade 
3 and 1 G rade 4 CRS events, including concurrent Grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity in one patient 
each (Cohen, 2016).  Finally, recent results published from a Phase 1 clinical trial in China  
presented at ASCO 2017 ( Fan, 2017) using a bi- specific BCMA -targeted CAR T (lentiviral 
vector with unclear costimulatory domain) in 35 RRMM subjects treated at doses from 0.6 to 7 x 
10
6 cells/kg showed 100% ORR with CR achieved in 15 of 35 (43% ) subjects.  In this trial, CRS 
was observed in [ADDRESS_1101484]- in-human clinical trial with bb2121, CAR+ T cell doses ranging from 150 
to 800 x 10
6 CAR+ T cells per subject showed encouraging efficacy and acceptable tolerability.    
Based on a data cut -off of 29 March 2018 in Study CRB-401, updated information is available 
on 43 subjects enrolled in the dose escalation and expansion phase of this trial. bb2121 doses (x 
106 CAR+ T cells) administered included: 50 (N = 3), 150 (N = 18), 200 (N = 1), 450 (N = 18) 
and 800 (N = 3). CRS of any grade was observed in 27 of 43 (63%) subjects with grade 3 CRS 
events reported in 2 of 43 subjects (4.6%). These included 1 reversible grade 3 CRS event at a 
dose of 450 and 800 x 106 CAR+ T cells, respectively. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 
days and median duration was 6 days. The overall frequency of CRS across the dose range of 
150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells was 60 %, including 39% at a dose of 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells 
and 83% at a dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. All cases of CRS were reversible.  Neurotoxicity

(2.3%) and no grade 3 events. The overall frequency of neurotoxicity across the dose range of 
150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells was 30% with a grade ≥ 3 frequency of 2.7%. This includes an 
overall frequency of 11% at a dose of 150 x 106 CAR+ T cel ls (with no grade ≥ 3 events ) and 
50% at a dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells (with one grade ≥ 3 events, 5.6%).  All cases of 
neurotoxicity were reversible.  For this analysis of n eurotoxicity, a broad inclusion of observed 
events within the neurologic System- Organ -Class (SOC) were included (dizziness, bradyphrenia, 
somnolence, confusional state, nystagmus, insomnia, memory impairment, depressed level of consciousness, neurotoxicity, lethargy, tremor and hallucination). Most neurologic events were 
grade 1/2 and likely multifactorial in nature, while only one grade ≥ 3 event clearly attributable to CAR T cell associated encephalopathy was reported. To address the grade ≥ 3 neurotoxici ty 
event observed in Study CRB-401, both the CRB-401 and BB2121- MM- 001 protocols were 
modified to update the eligibility criteria to exclude patient with history or presence of clinically relevant central nervous (CNS) pathology and the protocol safety monitoring plan, including a 
mandatory 14-day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], twice weekly outpatient visits in weeks 3 and 4 and a detailed 
CAR T toxicity management guideline to ensure adequate safety oversight.  To date no additional grade 3/[ADDRESS_1101485] 2 months of tumor response assessments or with disease 
progression within 2 months. Of these, 33 were treated across the dose range of 150 to 450 x 10

CAR+ T cells .  The reported overall tumor response rate (ORR) at doses of 150 to 450 x 106 
CAR+ T cells in 33 evaluable subjects was 79% with a median duration of response of 10.8 months.  A dose response was observed across the 150 – 450 x 10
6 CAR+ T cell dose range with 
an ORR of 57% at the  150 x 106 CAR+ T cells and 95% at the 450 x 106 CAR+ T cell dose. 
Within the active dose cohorts (150 to 800 x 106 CAR+ T cells) tumor response was more 
frequent in patients with CRS than without CRS (ORR 92% vs 55%, respectively). Based on 
these updated results, a dose range of 150 to  450 x 106 CAR+ T cell s is planned for th e Phase [ADDRESS_1101486] BCMA+ plasma cells in MM patients relies on the expansion of the CAR T cell population after infusion into the patient.  The rate and magnitude 
of the expansion and t he persistence of the CAR T cells may  be critical correlates of safety, 
efficacy and durability  of response ( Davila, 2014).  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be used 
to correlate expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells with anti -tumor efficacy  and safety .  
Additionally, the sampling plan and downstream analyses of the exploratory endpoints aim to 
address major open questions centered around the biology governing the durability and 
persistence of the CAR T cells as well as potential mechanisms of resistance to bb2121 CAR T 
cell therapy: mechanisms driven by [CONTACT_798612] T cell immunophenotype, the tumor microenvironment, or direct resistance by [CONTACT_7879].  
The pharmacokinetics of bb2121 CAR T cell expansion after infusion will be measured by [CONTACT_956] ( qPCR ) and correlated to clinical response including reduction in BCMA+ 
myeloma cells in the bone marrow and changes in soluble BCMA in the blood.  Cytokine

retrospectively understand the drivers of patient- specific CAR T cell mediated toxicity, an  
extensive soluble factor panel will be tested on a multiplex assay platform in addition to clinical 
laboratory monitoring.  This includes clinical markers of inflammation, such as C -reactive 
protein (CRP) and ferritin, as well as an extensive panel of over [ADDRESS_1101487] T cell response and/or neurotoxicity, including IL-2, IL- 6, IFNγ  and IL -
15. 
MRD in the bone marrow will be measured using both 8- color flow cytometry (standardized 
EuroFlow) and next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques measuring immunoglobulin gene 
rearrangements of the malignant clone .   
The magnitude and durability of anti- tumor response  may be governed by [CONTACT_798613], immun ophenotype of the BCMA+ CAR T cells, exhaustion, tumor 
resistance to the BCMA -directed CAR T therapy, or immunogenicity of the bb2121 CAR T cell 
leading to CAR T cell clearance. As continued anti-tumor response may be dependent on 
persistence of functional BCMA- directed CAR T cells, we will evaluate the persistence and 
immunophenotype of the bb2121 CAR T cells throughout the study using multi- parameter flow 
cytometry.  A comprehensive panel of T cell immunophenotypic  markers of activation, 
exhaustion, regulatory T cell (Treg ) status, and memory are in place to characterize the 
immun ophenotype of the CAR T  cell population in vivo.  Analysis of the bb2121 CAR T cell 
manufacturing and final product characteristics will help to identify key features associated with 
clinical safety and efficacy.  Persistent bb2121 CAR T cells may be come  hypofunctional in  vivo .  
As an example, the expression of progra mmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) is a marker of T cell 
exhaustion/dysfunction and may explain the mechanism of ineffective CAR T cell subsets.  PD -1 
and other markers of exhaustion/hypofunctionality, such as TIGIT, ICOS, TIM3, and LAG-3 
will be evaluated along with the traditional T cell subset markers  (eg, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, 
and Foxp3).  B one marrow will be evaluated for immune cell subsets (CAR T cells and 
endogenous immune cells) and presence of myeloma cells.  Understanding the full complexity of 
the CAR T  cell, myeloma cell , and tumor microenvironment may provide granularity into the 
patient -specific responses as well as inform potential combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798542] T cells or to reactivate  exhausted subsets. 
Tumor- specific mechanisms of treatment resistance will be evaluated .  BCMA antigen  and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_798543].  Examples of 
compensatory mechanisms that can be evaluated through gene expression profiling include upregulation of, or compensation by, expression of transmembrane activator CAML interactor

soluble factors, B -cell activating factor of the TNF family (sBAFF) and a proliferation -inducing 
ligand (sAPRIL), which can provide alternative survival signals through compensatory plasma 
cell receptors related to BCMA, such as TACI , will be monitored  (Chiu, 2007).  Upregulation of 
checkpoint molecules on the tumor will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_798615]. Bioinformatic analysis of longitudinal gene expression profiles provides an unbiased dataset informing both novel mechanisms of resistance as well as  potential new targets for MM 
therapy, including next generation CAR T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

of bridging therapy and prior to starting LD chemotherapy. 
After bb2121 drug product has been successfully manufactured , additional baseline evaluations 
are pe rformed to assess continued eligibility and safety prior to initiation of LD chemotherapy  
(refer to Section  6.1.3 and  Table  3). 
Subjects will receive three consecutive days of fludarabine intravenously (IV) (30 mg/m

cyclophosphamide IV (300 mg/m2) for LD chemotherapy starting on D ay -5. After the 
completion of LD chemotherapy, bb2121 will be administered by [CONTACT_22671] a dosing range 
from 150 - 45 0 x 106 CAR+ T cells /infusion on Day 0.  Due to  the risk of CRS  and 
neurotoxicity, subjects treated on this protocol must be admitted for inpatient monitoring through 
Day [ADDRESS_1101492]-bb2121 infusion; subjects may receive bb2121 as an outpatient, and then be

6.5.5. Assessment of R esponse 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator Assessment  
Starting from month 1, investigators will assess the results from central laboratories using the 
IMWG Uniform R esponse Criteria ( Kumar, 2016) (refer to Appendix B ) at every month for the 
first 6 months then every 3 months for a minimum of 24- month s or until disease progression , 
whichever is longer . Resp onse is based on the central laboratory data to ensure consistency 
across investigative sites , except for new or increase in bone lesions or extramedullary 
plasmacytomas.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Independent Response Committee (IRC) Assessment  
An IRC will be formed by a group of experts in the MM disease area to review data for response 
assessment . The IRC will determine the response to therapy based on the IMWG Uniform 
Response Criteria for each subject.  
The IRC will adjudicate efficacy data according to IRC Charter during the study.  The IRC adjudicated response data will be used for the primary and updated analyses  (at [ADDRESS_1101556], respectively), and for additional analyses if 
needed .   
Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted using response data, that are assessed by [CONTACT_798629] ( refer to Appendix B ).  Analyses using 
Investigator assessment will be supportive.

Confidential and Proprietary 69 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment 4.0 Final: 18 Jul 2019  NOTE: Per IMWG Uniform Response Criteria all response categories and progressive disease 
require [ADDRESS_1101557]’s health as well as physical, 
social, emotional, and functional well-being. 
The questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_798630]. If subjects refuse to complete all or any part of a questionnaire, this will be documented. Questionnaires should be completed in the language most familiar to each 
subject, and subjects should be given adequate time and space to complete the questionnaire. Site 
personnel should review questionnaires for completeness and ask subjects to complete any missing responses.  
Patient interviews will be used to c apture the experience on bb2121 from a patient perspective.  
6.6.1. EORTC- QLQ -C30 
The EORTC -QLQ- C30 questionnaire will be used as a measure of health -related quality of life. 
The QLQ -C30 is composed of both multi- item scales and single item measures. These include 
five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three sym ptom scales 
(fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health- related quality of life (HRQoL) 
scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial 
difficulties). Each of the multi- item scales includes a different set of items – no item occurs in 
more than one scale.  
The QLQ -C30 employs a week recall period for all items and a 4 -point scale for the functional 
and symptom scales/items with response categories “Not at all”, “A little”, “Quite a bit” and 
“Very much”. The two items assessing global health status/ HRQoL utilize a 7 -point scale 
ranging from 1(“Very Poor”) to 7 (“Excellent”) ( Aaronson, 1993). 
6.6.2. EQ-5D-5L 
EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_110613] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D- 5L 
consists of the EQ -5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The 
descriptive system comprises dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems) 
In 2005, a Task Force was established within the EuroQol Group to investigate methods to 
improve the instrument’s sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects. After much discussion, the Task Force decided that there should be no change in the number of dimen sions for a new 
version of EQ- 5D.

level versions of EQ -5D could significantly increase reliability and sensitivity (discriminatory 
power) while maintaining feasibility and potentially reducing ceiling  effects.  
The EQ -5D- 5L still consists of 2 pages – the EQ -5D-5L descriptive system (page 2) and the EQ 
Visual Analogue Scale (page 3). The descriptive system comprises the same 5 dimensions as the 
EQ-5D-3L (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anx iety/depression).  
However, each dimension now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, 
severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state 
by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropria te statement in each of the 5 
dimensions. This decision results in a 1- digit number expressing the level selected for that 
dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent’s health state. It should be noted that the numerals [ADDRESS_1101558] their scores. The EQ -5D-5L now asks respondents to simply ‘mark an X on the scale to 
indicate how your health is TODAY’ and then to ‘write the number you marked on the scale in 
the box below’. 
This should make the task easier for both respondents and users  (Herdman, 2011; The EuroQol, 
1990).  
6.6.3. EORTC- QLQ -MY20  
The EORTC has developed a myeloma module referred to as QLQ -MY20, to be administered 
alongside the core QLQ -C30.  The QLQ-MY20 is a 20- item myeloma module intended for use 
among patients varying in disease stage and treatment modality. The module has been validated 
and shown to be measuring additional aspects of HRQoL, such as body image and future 
perspective. 
6.6.4. Patient Interviews  
Standardiz ed measures of HRQoL have not been widely used in evaluations of CAR -T therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798572]2121, much has yet to be learned about its impact on HRQoL, which 
may currently be missed by [CONTACT_798631].  For this reason, subje cts will be 
invited to be interviewed during the study; the aim being to provide an opportunity for subjects 
to share their experiences with bb2121 therapy in their own words, capturing insights not usually 
recorded via the established patient re ported outcomes (PRO) scales and questionnaires.  
Subject s will be requested to participate in a series of interviews over the [ADDRESS_1101559] up to one hour and will be conducted in-person or via telephone. The 
remainder of the interviews will be shorter in duration, lasting approximately 30 minutes, and 
may be conducted either over the telephone or in-person. Inter views will be scheduled at a time 
convenient to the subjects. During the interviews, subjects may be asked about:

At prespecified time  points (r efer to Table  7), whole blood will be collected from each subject 
for analysis of bb2121 CAR+ T cell expansion and persistence (cellular kinetic profile).  CD3+ T 
cells, composed of endogenous and CAR T cells, will be isolated from the whole blood. DNA will be purified from the CD3+ sorted cells . The cellular kinetic profile  (PK)  will be  described 
by [CONTACT_798632][INVESTIGATOR_798575] (qPCR) using CD3+ sorted T cells. 
The enriched transgene copy number within  CD3+ cell s will be used for the pharmacokinetic

• Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_798578]2121 cells and circulating immune cell subsets to identify protein markers correlated with bb2121 activation, 
persistence and possible regulation of bb2121 cells by [CONTACT_798633]. 
• Soluble factors from plasma will be measured as a marker of immune activation and 
to determine potential correlations between cytokine/chemokine production, efficacy 
and severity of CRS and neurotoxicity. 
• Tumor related soluble factors such as sBCMA, sAPRIL, and sBAFF will be measured 
and correlated with efficacy.  
The data collected in these biomarker assessments will be used in aggregate to elucidate relationship between CAR T cell function, persistence, modulation of surface expressed 
molecules present in the tumor/tumor microenvironment, and peripheral blood and clinical 
response and toxicity.

7.1.1. bb2121 
bb2121 consists of autologous T lymphocytes transduced with an anti- BCMA02 CAR lentiviral  
vector to express a chimeric antigen receptor targeting the human B cell maturation antigen (anti -
BCMA CAR) and suspended in cryopreservative solution as a cellular dispersion for infusion. 
A schematic of the lentiviral vector transgene used to transduce the autologous T lymphocytes is 
shown below. 
Schematic Representation of Anti -BCMA02 Chimeric Antigen Receptor   
 
Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV is a replication defective, self -inactivating (SIN), third generation  
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) based LVV, pseudotyped with the vesicular 
stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) envelope protein, encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) (anti- BCMA CAR). This  
vector uses the murine leukemia virus -derived m yeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer,  
negative control region deleted, dl587rev primer binding site substituted (MND) promoter to  
drive expression of the CAR. Autologous T cells transduced with anti- BCMA02 LVV results in  
production of an integral membrane protein composed of: 1) an extracellular single chain  
variable fragment (scFv) containing the light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain  
variable region (VH) from a mouse anti- BCMA monoclonal antibody (mAb C11D5.3); 2) the  
hinge and transmembrane domain from human CD8α; and 3) the T cell cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD137 (4- 1BB) and the CD3ζ chain, in tandem.

9.1. Overview  
This is an open- label, single arm,  multi -center Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy  and safety  
of bb2121 in subjects with RRMM. 
Summaries of continuous variables will present the number of subjects included in the analysis 
(N), the mean and standard deviation (SDev) of the mean, the median, the minimum, and the 
maximum statistics.  Counts and percentages will be presented in summar ies of categorical 
variables.  The denominator for each percentage will be the number of subjects in the population 
unless otherwise specified.  In general, missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise 
specified.  
All statistical analyses specified in this protocol will be conducted using SAS® Version 9.[ADDRESS_1101580] 
received bb2121 infusion. 
The bb2121- treated population will be used for the primary analysis for efficacy and safety.  
9.2.4. Efficacy Evaluable Population  
The Efficacy E valuable (EE) population will include all subjects in the bb2121-t reated 
population who have had a baseline and at least one post baseline (ie, post -bb2121 infusion) 
efficacy assessment.  
9.2.5. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population  
The Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis population includes subjects who received at least one 
bb2121 infusion and have evaluable CAR T (ie, at least one measurable time point).  The 
retreatment PK analysis population includes subjects who received the bb2121 retreatment dose and have evaluable CAR T data (ie, at least one measurable time point post dose) for the retreatment period.

population. 
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, overall response rate (ORR), the sample size is based on one-
sample binomial test with normal approximation . The null hypothesis to be tested is that the 
ORR (defined as the proportion of subjects with at least a partial response (PR) based on all 
bb2121 treated subjects) is ≤ 50%; the alternative hypothesis is that the ORR is > 50%, with a 
target ORR of 70% .  With these hypotheses, a sample size of 119 bb2121 treated subjects would 
provide > 99% power at a one- sided 0.025 alpha level. This criterion requires that the lower limit 
of the 95% confidence intervals for the ORR is greater than 50%. Assuming a dropout rate of 15% between the time of study enrollment and bb2121 infusion, a total number of up to 140 
subjects will be enrolled. 
The selection of a null hypothesis of 50% ORR is based on the observed clinical activity of the 
best available single agent therapy in a heavily pretreated RRMM patient population.  
Daratumumab demonstrated a response rate ranging from 29% to 36% in RRMM patients who had received at least 3 prior lines of therapy including an IMiD drug and a proteasome inhibitor 
or who were double refractory ( Dimopoulos, 2015; Richardson, 2014; San Miguel, 2013). A null 
hypothesis of 50% ORR represents an approximately 50% improvement over 
daratumumab  (Daralex, 2017). The target ORR  of 70%  is based on the preliminary efficacy 
observed with bb2121 in the Phase 1 study, including an ORR of 81% in 36 evaluable patients receiving b2121 doses of 150 - 800 x 10
6 CAR+ T cells  (Raje, 2018). A target ORR of 70% is 
considered achievable based on the existing clinical efficacy data with bb2121 and also 
represents an approximately 100% improvement over daratumumab.  
If the ORR is tested posit ive, CR rate will be tested using a stepdown approach to control the 
overall alpha level, which will remain at the one -sided 0.025 level. For CR rate, the null 
hypothesis is ≤ 10% , with a target CR rate of 20% . With these hypotheses, also using one- sample 
binomial test, the same sample size of 119  bb2121 treated subjects would provide approximately 
89% power at a one -sided 0.025 alpha level. This criterion requires that the lower limit of the  
two-sided  95% confidence intervals for the CR rate is greater than 10%.  
9.4. Baseline  and Demographic Characteristics 
Subject’s age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations for both bb2121-treated population and Enrolled population. 
Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by [CONTACT_16252] (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferr ed term (PT) for both the

9.6. Study Drug Exposure 
Dosing information for cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will be summarized for the Enrolled 
population.  Study drug administration and dosing information, will be summarized for the 
bb2121-t reated population. 
9.7. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the E nrolled  population, bb2121-t reated population and 
EE population. The primary efficacy analysis will be  based on response assessments adjudicated 
by [CONTACT_798636]  ( Kumar, 2016) in the bb2121-treated population.  
A responder will be any subject who shows at least a partial response (PR).  The overall response rate (ORR) will be defined as the percentage of responders.  The complete response (CR) rate 
will be defined as the percentage of subjects with at least a CR  or sCR.  ORR and CR rates with 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for the overall population as well as for relevant subgroups including: dosing subgroups within the 150 to 450 x 10

high risk cytogenetics [t(4;14), t(14;16), or del17p], high risk MM (R- ISS III), tumor BCMA 
expression (≥ versus < 50% BCMA+) and others as relevant .  
For responders, time to response and response duration will be analyzed.  Time to response is the time from the date of bb2121 infusion to the first documentation of response of PR or better.  
Time to response will be summarized for responders using summary statistics.  
Duration of response is the time from date of firs t documentation of response of  PR or  better to  
the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever is first .   
Progression- free survival is time from the date of bb2121 infusion to the first documented 
disease progression or death, whichever is earlier. Subjects who have not progressed and are still 
alive will be censored at the date of last adequate response assessment.  
Time to progression is time from the date of bb2121 infusion to the first documented disease 
progression.  Subjects who died prior to disease progression will be censored at the date of last 
adequate response assessment.  
Overall survival is time from the date of bb2121 infusion to the date of death  due to any cause. 
Subjects who are still alive will be censored at  the date last known alive or the data cut- off date 
(if applicable), whichever is earlier.  
Kaplan -Meier procedures will be used to characterize the time -to-event curves (PFS, TTP, OS, 
and duration of response ). 
9.7.1. Assessment of MRD  
A secondary efficacy endpoint will consist of an analysis of clinical  and imaging responses (per 
IMWG 2016 criteria ) to study treatment in MRD  negative and positive subpopulations.  Clinical 
and imaging responses will be assessed for potential relationship to MRD  status.  The MRD 
status will be assessed in all subjects at baseline, M1, M3, M6, M12, M18 and M24.  If PD

MRD negative rates in the bb2121-treated population with 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  For MRD negative rate using NGS, one- sample binomial test will be performed as 
descriptive analysis.  T he null hypothesis is MRD negative rate ≤ 10%, and the target is ≥ 20%. 
With these assumptions , also using the same sample size of 119  bb2121 t reated subjects would

criterion requires that the lower limit of the two -sided 95% confidence intervals for the  MRD 
negative rate is greater than 10%.

Adverse event s that occur between enrollment (ie, start of leukapheres is) and bb2121 infusion 
will be summarized for all subjects in the Enrolled population.  
All subjects in the bb2121-t reated p opulation, will be included in the safety analyses between 
enrollment and bb2121 infusion and post -bb2121 treatment follow -up period.  Adverse events, 
vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory information, and concomitant medications will be summarized as appropriate.   Frequency and percentage of all AEs (including serious, Grade 3/4,

A potential immune response to bb2121 will be evaluated for both humoral response as well as 
cell mediated responses.  Serum samples collected from subjects post- infusion will be evaluated 
for a humoral response, for the formation of anti-CAR antibodies, using an immunoassay

10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events 
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
10.2.1. Seriousness  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: 
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Constitutes an important medical event.  
An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent [ADDRESS_1101589]:  
• For the purpose of this study, any new malignancy or new diagnosis of autoimmune-like, rheumatologic, or new diagnosis of hematologic disorder will be considered  as a 
medically important AESI and, therefore immediately reportable to the Sponsor even 
if the events do not meet SAE criteria . 
• Grade ≥  3 adverse e vents of CRS , MAS, neurologic toxicity and infection will be 
considered as medically important A ESIs and , therefore immediately reportable to the 
Sponsor, even if the events do not meet SAE criteria.  
All AESIs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event. All AESIs should be communicated to the Sponsor on the SAE report form as

reported as an SAE.  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
• the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE. 
• a procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE. 
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.  
• a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication remains a reportable SAE.  
• an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline.  
• emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.  
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.  
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to bb2121, action taken regarding bb2121, and outcome. 
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event.  
The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
Version 4.03).  
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity/intensity according to 
the following scale:  
• Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required  
• Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required

Protocol BB2121- MM- 001  Celgene Corporation

medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]  
• Grade  4 = Life -threatening  – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380725] 
• Grade  5 = Death - the event results in death  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not  the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
10.2.3. Causality  
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of  LD 
chemotherapy or bb2121 and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as 
defined below: 
Not suspected:  a causal relatio nship of the adverse event to LD chemotherapy or 
bb2121 administration is unlikely or remote , or other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Suspected:  there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of LD 
chemotherapy or bb2121 caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between LD chemotherapy or bb2121 and the adverse event.

must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ). 
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values 
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality  (if applicable) : 
• results in discontinuation from the study; 
• requires treatment, modification/ interruption of bb2121 dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention; or 
• is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition. 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).  
10.4. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring at any time after receipt of bb2121, in either a female subject of childbearing potential or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject, are immediately reportable events
.   
10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β hCG or positive pregnancy test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state), of a female subject occurring at any time after infusion  of bb2121, are immediately reportable events.  The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6968], phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalen t form.   
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one experienced 
in reproductive toxicity, or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation.  
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.

should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
The course of all pregnancies, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, regardless of whether 
the subject has discontinued participation in the study, will be followed until outcome, including follow -up of the health status of the newborn for 1 year.  SAEs experienced by [CONTACT_302835] 1 
year is required to be immediately reported ( ie, within 24 hours) on the SAE Report Form, or 
approved equivalent form. 
10.4.2. Male Subjects  
If a female par tner of a male subject that received bb2121 becomes pregnant, the male subject 
that received bb2121 should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be 
advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.    
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the e CRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow -up reports. 
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.   
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to bb2121) that occur during the study (from the time the subject signs informed consent through [ADDRESS_1101591] infusion  
of bb2121).  In addition, all ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1101592]-bb2121 infusion until Month 24/EOS .  From Month 25 through to end of study

10.7. Potential Risks and Management of Treatment Toxicities 
A summary of potential risks and management of treatment toxicity is provided below. See the  
Investigator ’s Brochure for a complete discussion of potential risks associated with bb2121.  
10.7.1. Cytokine Release Syndrome  
Administration of CAR T cells is associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  and CRS has 
been reported frequently following treatment with bb2121. CRS is a potentially serious disorder associated with uncontrolled activation and proliferation of CAR T cells and associated cytokine 
secretion.  CRS is characterized by [CONTACT_242679], fatigue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, hypotension, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, anorexia, and neurologic abnormalities (eg, 
altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activity).   Laboratory abnormalities may include cytopenias, coagulopathy, electrolyte, renal and 
liver function abnormalities as well as c -reactive protein, ferritin and cytokine elevations.  Organ 
dysfunction, in particular, cardiac, pulmonary and neurologic dysfunction, can be observed as 
part of CRS.  
Refer to Appendix C  for detailed information on diagnosis, grading and clinical m anagement of 
CRS. 
10.7.2. Macrophage Activation Syndrome 
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a potentially serious disorder associated with uncontrolled activation and proliferation of CAR T cells and subsequent activation of 
macrophages. MAS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_798584] -grade, non- remitting fever, cytopenias, 
and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory abnormalities found in MAS include elevated 
inflammatory cytokine levels, serum ferritin, soluble IL- 2 receptor (sCD25), triglycerides, and 
decreased circulating NK cells. Other findings include variable levels of transaminases, signs of acute liver failure, coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. There are no definitive diagnostic criteria for MAS; it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_291269] u sing published criteria for 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  (Schulert, 2015) . While there is considerable overlap in 
clinical manifestations and laboratory findings between MAS and CRS, other distinguishing MAS physical findings such as hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are not common in 
adult subjects treated with activated T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Refer to Appendix C  for detailed information on diagnosis, grading and clinical management of 
CRS and related MAS.

Confidential and Proprietary 98 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment 4.0 Final: 18 Jul 2019  10.7.3. Fever  
The possibility of CRS should be considered for all subjects with fe ver (≥ 38°C /≥100.4°F ) 
following bb2121 infusion. Subjects should be monitored closely for hemodynamic instability 
and changing neurologic status. Febrile subjects, neutropenic or otherwise, should be evaluated 
promptly for infection and managed per institutional or standard clinical practice.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Temperature Self -monitoring  
Once bb2121 infusion has completed and subject is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , subjects are 
required to take their temperature , every 6 to 8 hours (while  awake) through M1 post-bb2121 
infusion and record the temperature information in the provided diary.  They must contact [CONTACT_798639] ≥  38°C/ ≥100.4°F. S ite staff should review the temperature 
self-monitoring diary at each study visit through Month 1.  Subjects should not take any 
nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) s uch as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen 
sodium (Aleve), aspi[INVESTIGATOR_219578] (Tylenol) because these can mask fevers.  Fevers are a 
critically important sign that requires subjects to report to the treating institution as soon as possible for mandatory inpatient admission.  Fevers might possibly be the only warning of life-threatening toxicity that can quickly arise in subjects receiving CAR T cells. If subjects are in 
clinic for a visit when a self-monitoring temperature is to be done the temperatur e may be taken 
by [CONTACT_96937]. At the discretion of individual investigators, subjects may remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_798585].  
10.7.4. Neurologic Toxicities  
CAR T cell therapy is associated with potentially serious neurologic toxicities  and life- 
threatening neurotoxicity has been reported with bb2121.  The etiology and optimal management of neurologic toxicities remains unclear.  Neurologic symptoms may include altered mental 
status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure- like activity, and can 
accompany CRS (precede or follow other CRS symptoms) or can occur in isolation.  Neurologic 
symptoms may begin 2 to 14 days (can be later)  after CAR T cell infusion and in severe cases 
may require admission to the ICU for frequent monitoring, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], or intubation for airway protection.   Any signs or symptoms of neurotoxicity (other than headache) should prompt 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Refer to Appendix C  for detailed information on diagnosis, grading and clinical management of 
neurologic toxicities. 
10.7.5. Infusion Reactions  
Administration of bb2121 may cause infusion reactions, such as fever, rigors, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, hypotension, and/or nausea. 
To minimize the risk of infusion reactions, all subjects should receive premedication prior to 
bb2121 infusion.  Pre-medication should occur approximately 30 minutes prior to the infusion 
and should include acetaminophen 650 mg orally (or according to institutional standards) and 
diphenhydramine 12.5 mg IV or 25 to 50 mg orally (or equivalent). Mild infusion reactions should be managed expectantly with antipyretics, antihistamines, and anti- emetics. 
Corticosteroids should be avoided because of the potential impact on efficacy of infused bb2121. Rigors may be treated with meperidine (pethidine).

bb2121 
Protocol BB2121- MM- 001  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 99 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment 4.0 Final: 18 Jul 2019  The following guidelines should be followed for infusion reactions: 
• Grade 1: administer symptomatic treatment; continue bb2121 infusion at the same 
dose and rate 
• Grade 2: administer symptomatic treatment; continue bb2121 with a reduced rate of 
administration  
• Grade 3: stop administration of bb2121, administer symptomatic treatment, and resume at a reduced rate of administration only after symptoms resolve. If Grade 3 reaction recurs, discontinue bb2121 infusion. 
• Grade 4: discontinue administration of bb2121 and administer symptomatic treatment as necessary; no further bb2121 should be administered. 
10.7.6. Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Both LD chemotherapy and bb2121 may cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in subjects with high 
disease burden. Subjects should be closely monitored for laboratory evidence of TLS, and 
subjects at high risk should receive prophylactic treatment per standard clinical practice. Treatment of TLS should be administered per institutional standards.  In severe cases 
hemodialysis may be required. 
10.7.7. Plasma Cell Aplasia and Hypogammaglobulinemia  
Plasma cell aplasia is an expected off -tumor, on-target toxicity of bb2121 and was observed in 
the phase [ADDRESS_1101597] as long as bb2121 CAR+ T cells remain in the body.  Prolonged plasma cell aplasia 
is expected to result in hypogammaglobulinemia which can also be observed as a manifestation of myeloma itself.  Hypogammaglobulinemia may increase the risk of bacterial and other 
infections including opportunistic infections and viral reactivation.  Serum immunoglobulin 
levels will be obtained from all subjects prior to and at regular time points following bb2121 treatment.  It is recommended that s ubjects with serum IgG level s less than 400 mg/dL receive 
intravenous immunoglobulin replacement as needed to maintain an IgG level above 400 mg/dL, unless there is a contraindication to such therapy.  A decision to stop IVIG therapy should be made on a case-by- case basis, preferably in consultation with the Sponsor. The use of 
prophylactic antibiotics may also be considered.  
10.7.8. Replication -Competent Lentivirus, Clonality and Insertional Oncogenesis  
Lentiviral vectors used in gene transfer are engineered to be replication -defective; however, 
generation of RCL during manufacturing is still a possibility. Modern vector production systems 
have been improved to reduce the risk of RCL generation. To date, there have been no reports of 
RCL generated during lentiviral vector manufacturing, which may be due, at least in part, to the use of self -inactivating vectors such as the lentiviral vector used in the production of 
bb2121 ( Rothe, 2013). 
Concern for possible neoplastic transformation  due to the location of the vector integration into 
the host genome has arisen due to preclinical studies that have shown retrovirus -mediated 
malignant transformation in mice  (Li, 2002; Modlich, 2005 ) and monkeys ( Donahue, 1992) and 
a single clinical study reporting development of leukemia in subjects with X-linked severe

stem cells ( Hacein -Bey-Abina, 2003), including one subject who died ( Couzin, 2005). Of note, 
no instances of RCL generation during production or lentivirus- mediated malignant 
transformation in animals or subjects treated in trials of gene -modified T cells have been 
reported to date. 
Data has recently been published on the integration sites of retroviral and lentiviral vectors used 
for T cell modification in clinical trials ( McGarrity, 2013; Scholler, 2012; Wang, 2009). No 
clonality of integration sites was observed. In addition, there did not appear to be enrichment of 
integration sites near genes involved in clonal expansion or persistence.  
10.7.9. New Malignancies and Other Potential Late Toxicities of Gene Therapy  
New malignancies represent AESI s and must be reported as SAEs and includes any second 
primary malignancy, (refer to Section  10.2.1).  All new malignancies will be recorded from 
informed consent through to Month 24/EOS (for subject who had PD).  From Month [ADDRESS_1101598] also be documented in 
the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and subject’s source documents. Documentation on the diagnosis of the new malignancy must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory histology or cytology results, X- rays, CT scans, etc).  
Other potential late toxicities of genetically modified T cells include neurologic disorders, hematologic disorders, rheumatic and autoimmune disorders or exacerbation of one of these pre-existing conditions.  Monitoring for these AESI will be performed in this study as well as the 
planned LTFU study. 
10.8. Risks Associated with Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy 
Subjects will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to treatment with bb2121 to facilitate LD chemotherapy and CAR T cell engraftment. Common side effects of fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide include bone marrow cytopenias and immune suppression which increase the risk of bleeding and infection and may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_798606]2121 treatment.  Refer to the 
summary of product characteristics for specific details surrounding the risks of fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide.

14.1. Data/Documents 
The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the 
study and the distribution of the investigational product are complete, accurate, filed and retained.  Examples of source documents include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]; clinic and office charts; 
laboratory notes; memoranda; dispensing records; recorded data from automated instruments; 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_12607]; microfiche; x -ray 
film and reports; and records kept at the pha rmacy, and the laboratories, as well as copi[INVESTIGATOR_798586]- ROM.  
14.2. Data Management 
Data will be collected via e CRF and entered into the clinical database per Celgene standard 
operating procedures ( SOPs ). This data will be electronically verified through use of 
programmed edit checks specified by [CONTACT_6098].  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary.  Resolutio ns 
to these issues will be reflected in the database.  An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  
14.3. Record Retention 
Essential documents must be retained by [CONTACT_184694]. The I nvestigator must retain these documents for the time period 
described above or according to local laws or requirements, whichever is longer. Essential 
documents include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Signed ICF s for all subjects;  
• Subject identification code list, screening log (if applicable), and enrollment log;  
• Record of all communications between the Investigator and the IRB/EC; 
• Composition of the IRB/EC; 
• Record of all communications between the Investigator, Celgene, and their authorized representative(s);  
• List of Sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom the 
Investigator has delegated significant study -related duties, together with their roles in 
the study, curriculum vitae, and their signatures;  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_184613]; 
• bb2121 accountability records;  
• Record of any body fluids or tissue samples retained; 
• All other source documents (subject records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory records, 
etc.);

15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification  
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a Celgene representative will review the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will include on- site visits with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_27738]. 
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study- specific monitoring plan. 
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/ ECs, regulatory authorities (e g, FDA, European Medicines 
Agency [ EMA ], Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  The Investigator 
should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If the Investigator is 
contact[CONTACT_137832], he/she should contact [CONTACT_184696].

Absence of clonal plasma c ells by [CONTACT_9064] (κ/λ ratio ≤4:1 
or ≥1:2 for κ and λ patients, respectively, after counting ≥100 plasma cells)††  
Complete Response (CR)  Negative immunofixation of serum and urine and 
Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and  
 < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_798589]: 
CR in such patients indicates a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to CR criteria listed above.  
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  Serum and urine M -protein detectable by [CONTACT_159444] 
90% or greater reduction in serum M -protein plus urine M -protein level 
<100 mg per 24 hours  
 
In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by [CONTACT_128758]: 
VGPR in such patients requires a > 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels.  
Partial Response (PR)  ≥ 50% reduction of serum M -Protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M -
protein by ≥ 90% or to < 200 mg per 24 hours  
If the serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, a ≥ 50% decrease in 
the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein criteria. 
If serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable, and the serum free light 
chain assay is also unmeasurable, a ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M -protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma 
cell percentage was ≥ 30%  
In addition to these criteria, if present at baseline, a ≥50% reduction in the 
size measured by [CONTACT_798643] (SPD)
 §§ of the m aximal 
perpendicular diameters of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required  
Stable Disease (SD)  Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR,  MR, PR, or progressive disease (PD)

Confidential and Proprietary 121 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment 4.0 Final: 18 Jul 2019  APPENDIX C. GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF COMMON TOXICITIES THAT OCCUR AFTER CAR T CELL 
INFUSIONS  
 
1. CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME 
Administration of cellular products such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- expressing T cells 
can be associated with cytokine- associated toxicity due to systemic production and release of 
various cytokines into the circulation. Cytokine- associated toxicit y, also known as cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS), is a toxicity that occurs as a result of immune activation ( Lee, 2014; 
Gardner 2017).  
1.1. Pathophysiology of Cytokine Release Syndrome  
The hallmark of CRS is immune activation resulting in elevated inflammatory cytokines. 
Cytokine release syndrome clinically manifests when large numbers of lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, and/or natural killer cells) and/or myeloid cells (macrophages, dendr itic cells, and 
monocytes) become activated and release inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine release syndrome has classically been associated with therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, most notably anti- CD3 (OKT3), anti -CD52 (alemtuzumab), anti- CD20  (rituximab), and the CD28 
super-agonist, TGN1412. Cytokine release syndrome is also frequently observed following administration of bi-specific T cell engaging antibodies for leukemia, and adoptive cellular immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_72911], most notably CAR T c ells. Incidence, time to onset and severity of 
CRS due to CAR T cells is at least partially dependent on the infused cell dose and tumor burden/antigen density, presumably due to more rapid and higher levels of CAR T cell activation. Onset of CRS symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_798591] T 
cell infusion, usually preceding maximal in vivo T cell expansion. Cytokine release syndrome is 
associated with elevated interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis alpha (TNFα ) levels, and increases in IL -2, granulocyte macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM -
CSF), IL-10, IL-8, IL-5, and fractalkine although the pattern of elevated cytokines varies among subjects ( Davila, 2014; Hay, 2017). IL -6 has been identified as a central mediator of toxicity in 
CRS. IL -6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with anti- inflammatory and proinflammatory properties. 
High levels of IL- 6, present in the context of CRS, likely initiates a proinflammatory IL -6-
mediated  signaling cascade.  
1.2. Clinical Presentation of Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Cytokine release syndrome is characterized by [CONTACT_242679], fatigue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, hypotension, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms and severity of CRS are highly variable ( Table 1 ) (Lee, 2014 ), and management can be  
complicated by [CONTACT_119269]. Cytokine release syndrome usually occurs within two weeks after infusion ( Abramson, 2017; Berdeja, 2017; Schuster, 2017).  
• Fever, especially high fever ( ≥ 38.5 ° C or ≥ 101.3 °F), is a commonly -observed hallmark 
of CRS, and many features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infection must be considered in all subjects presenting with CRS symptoms, and appropriate cultures must be obtained and empi[INVESTIGATOR_798592].

• Neurologic toxicity has been observed concurrently with CRS; refer to Section 2. 
• With other CAR T cell products, CRS has been reported in a few cases to be associated with findings of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap.

1.3. Clinical Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Across various CAR T cell products, early manifestations of CRS can predict more severe 
toxicity for both CRS and neurotoxicity (NT).  
Subjects with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and high burden of disease are at high 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_304878] ( Frey, 2017). Subjects with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who have 
high baseline tumor burden (measured by [CONTACT_304942] 
[SPD] or high serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH; ≥ 500 U/L] prior to the start of 
lymphodepletion) also have a higher risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_304879]/or neurotoxicity

It should be noted that, although useful for identifying subjects at higher risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_304880], CRP, ferritin, and serum cytokine levels should not be used for CRS clinical management/treatment decisions in the absence of other clinical signs and symp toms of CRS; for 
example, a subject with an elevated CRP but no concomitant symptoms may not require intervention ( Park, 2017). Thus, close observation of these subjects is strongly recommended.

Detailed CRS management guidelines are shown in Figure 1. Treatment should be individualized 
for each subject’s clinical needs. This guidance emphasizes the importance of early intervention for Grade 2 CRS, or in the setting of a rapid onset or rapid progression of CRS symptoms, to 
prevent the development of se vere (Grade 3 or greater) CRS and neurotoxicity. 
In some cases, tocilizumab, an anti- IL-6R-antibody, may be required to treat toxicities such as 
severe CRS. Please refer to the currently approved Actemra
® prescribing information ( US) or 
RoActemra® Summary of Product Characteristics (EU ). Actemra® has been approved by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA) for the treatment of CAR T cell-induced severe or life-
threatening CRS in adults. The preferred dose to intervene in adult subjects with CRS is 8 mg/kg 
(maximum 800 mg) IV. If no clinical improve ment in the signs and symptoms of CRS occurs 
after the first dose, additional doses of tocilizumab may be administered (please see Figure 1,

CAR T cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicities. Neurologic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure- like 
activity. The start of neurologic symptoms has been noted between 3 to 23 days (median 10 
days) ( Abramson, 2017) after CAR T cell infusion and in severe cases may require admission to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) for frequent monitoring, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], or intubation for airway protection. The symptoms are variable and generally occur as CRS is resolving or after CRS resolution. 
2.1. Pathophysiology of Neurologic Toxicities 
The pathogenesis of neurotoxicity is poorly defined. Subjects with NHL who have high baseline tumor burden (measured by [CONTACT_798646] (≥ 500 U/L) prior to the start of lymphodepletion) also have a highe r risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_798595] ( Siddiqi, 2017). In addition, severe neurotoxicity has also been reported in subjects 
with B -cell ALL and higher disease burden at the time of CD19 directed CAR T cell infusion 
(Park, 2017; Gust, 2017).  
Peak levels of IL -6, IFN- γ, ferritin, and CRP are significantly higher in subjects who develop any 
grade or Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity ( Turtle, 2016; Heipel, 2017). In a study treating NHL 
subjects with a CD19-directed CAR using a CD28 costimulatory domain, development of Grade 
≥ 3 neurologic events and CRS correlated with elevation of various cytokines, including IL -6, 
IL-15, and IL- 2Rα. Subjects with CRS -independent Grade ≥ 3 neurologic events had higher 
CAR T cell levels and specific cytokines, including interleukin -2, GM-CSF, and ferritin 
(Neelapu, 2017). Protein levels in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) are usually elevated in patients 
with neurotoxicity, compared with baseline measurements, suggesting disruption of the blood -
brain barrier. Other organ dysfunction (hepatic and renal), as well as hypoxemia , and infection, 
might also contribute to the encephalopathy ( Neelapu, 2018). In another study, it has been 
reported that evidence for cytokine-mediated endothelial activation causes coagulopathy, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], and blood- brain barrier disruption allowing transit of high concentrations of 
systemic cytokines into the CSF ( Gust, 2017).  
2.2. Clinical Management of Neurologic Toxicities 
The optimal management of CAR T cell-induced neurotoxicity is unknown at this time. These 
management guidelines represent the current state of knowledge and additional information will be provided to Investigators as it becomes available. Management should also be guided as per 
institutional or standard clinical practice, and as determined by [CONTACT_798647]/or consulting neurologist. A thorough neurologic evaluation, including electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT) 
scan of the brain and diagnostic lumbar puncture and frequent monitoring of cognitive function 
(eg, mini mental status exams or handwriting tests) should be considered.  
Treatable causes of neurologic dysfunction, such as infection or hemorrhage should be ruled out. 
Common manifestations of neurotoxicity (eg, confusion, seizure, aphasia), can also be seen with 
infection, electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, uremia, concomitant medication use (eg, narcotics), and other medical conditions. Other causes for such symptoms should be considered.

Confidential and Proprietary 127 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_1101624] scans of the brain are usually negative for any anatomical 
pathology that would account for the neurotoxicity symptoms observed in subjects treated with 
CAR T cell therapy, although rare cases of reversible T2/fluid attenu ated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR) MRI hyperintensity involving the thalami, dorsal pons, and medulla, and cerebral 
edema have been reported ( Neelapu, 2018).  
For subjects who have neurologic toxicity in the presence of CRS, the CRS should be managed following the guidelines provided in Figure 1.  
Neurotoxicity should be evaluated following the guidelines provided in Figure 2. For concurrent 
CRS and neurotoxicity, the most aggressive intervention recommended by [CONTACT_798648] (if the recommendations for steroid doses differ, use the highest dose and/or frequency). For subjects with Grade 4 neurotoxicity wi th cerebral edema, high -dose 
corticosteroids, hyperventilation and hyperosmolar therapy has been recommended (Neelapu,  2018).  
Note: Tocilizumab is not recommended for the treatment of neurotoxicity related to CAR T cell 
therapy, unless CRS or MAS/HLH is also present. Results from 2 studies, one of preemptive use 
of tocilizumab shortly after anti -CD19 CAR T cell therapy in relapse d/refractory NHL subjects 
(Locke, 2017), and the other mandatory use of tocilizumab at first fever [> 38.5 °C] in pediatric 
ALL patients treated with anti -CD19 CAR T cells ( Gardner, 2017), demonstrated that early 
tocilizumab use either increased overall neurotoxicity and Grade ≥ 3 neurotoxicity rates (85% vs 62% overall; 35% vs 26% Grade ≥ 3) or provided no improvement in neurotoxicity rates, 
respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that tocilizumab does not improve and may 
worsen isolated neurotoxicity ( Locke, 2017).   
Neurotoxicity management guidelines are provided in Figure 2.

Confidential and Proprietary  3 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment No. 4.0 Final: 18 Jul 2019  1. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT  
 
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below: 
• Moved minimal residual disease ( MRD) assessment by [CONTACT_798649] . 
The primary purpose of this protocol amendment is to m ove the MRD assessment by 
[CONTACT_798650]. The draft guidance “Hematologic Malignancies: Regulatory Considerations for Use of 
Minimal Residual Disease in Development of Drug and Biological Products for Treatment Guidance for Industry” recommends that the Sponsor prespecify the selected 
platform for MRD assessment. The initial protocol language included the potential use of both EuroFlow and next generation sequencing ( NGS ). The changes in the amendment 
make it clear that NGS is the selected methodology for analysis as the secondary 
endpoint, and the EuroFlow analysis will be conducted as an exploratory endpoint.  
o Revised Sections:  Protocol Summary, Table 1 : Study Objectives, and Table 2 : 
Study Endpoints 
• Updated the term “v ector copy number ” (VCN). 
To avoid confusion of the term VCN when discussing the manufacture of bb2121 and 
when discussing the characterization of chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) + T cell 
expansion in the peripheral blood or bone marrow postinfusion , VCN as related to CAR+ 
T cell expansion  will now be referred to as cellular kinetics , pharmacokinetics ( PK), 
CAR+ T  cells, or CAR transgene.   
o Revised Sections:  Protocol Summary , Table 1: Study Objectives, Table 3: Table 
of Events, Table 5: Table of Events – Evaluations for Disease Progression after Month 24, Section 6.1.1. Screening Evaluations (performed within 28 days prior 
to leukapheresis), Section 6.3.1. Post-bb2121 Infusion (Day 1 through Month 1), 
Section 6.3.2. Post-bb2121 Infusion (M1 through Month 24/EOS), Section 6.3.4. Post-bb2121 Infusion (Disease Progression/CR), Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Vector 
Integration Site Analysis, Section 6.7. Pharm acokinetics, Section [IP_ADDRESS]. bb2121 
Infusion, and Section 9.9. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
• Separated the secondary objective of characterization of the expansion of CAR+ T 
cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow into two objectives.  Evaluation of 
CAR+ T cells in the peripheral blood will remain as a secondary objective while 
evaluation in the bone marrow will be an exploratory objective. Evaluation in the 
bone marrow was also added as an exploratory endpoint. 
As the characterization of CAR + T cell expansion in the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow are considered two distinct analyses, where one is serving as a PK measurement; 
this objective has been separated into two objectives.  Qualification of the assay to 
perform the assessment of CAR+ T cells in the bone marrow was conducted to a level to 
support use as an exploratory objective  and exploratory endpoint only.

Study Endpoints 
• Removed the secondary objective and secondary endpoint , “Evaluate cytokine 
induction in the blood of subjects after infusion of bb2121” , and removed cytokines 
as a key safety assessment . 
This objective and endpoint was previously listed as both secondary and exploratory. 
Qualification of the assay was  performed to support use as an exploratory objective and 
exploratory endpoint only.   
o Revised Sections: Protocol Summary , Table 1: Study Objectives, and Table 2: 
Study Endpoints 
• Moved the secondary objective and secondary endpoint , “Evaluate the percentage 
of B- cell maturation antigen (BCMA)- expressing (BCMA+) cells and levels of 
BCMA expression in bone marrow, and the level of circulating soluble BCMA” to exploratory objectives and exploratory endpoints . 
Qualification of the assay was perform ed to support use as an exploratory objective and 
exploratory endpoint only.  
o Revised Sections: Protocol Summary , Table 1: Study Objectives, and Table 2: 
Study Endpoints 
• Clarified the defini tion of “cellular kinetic s”. 
The cellular kinetic profile (PK) will be described by [CONTACT_798632][INVESTIGATOR_798596] 
(qPCR) using CD3+ sorted T cells.  
o Revised Section:  Section 6.7. Pharmacokinetics 
• Clarified the definition of the Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Population.  
Definition of the retreatment PK Analysis Population was added to differentiate the subjects in the population who were retreated (received a second bb2121 dose). 
o Revised Section: Section 9.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population 
• Removed option to remanufacture bb2121 from cryopreserved  peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for retreatment.  
Subjects who progress after initial bb2121 infusion are at risk of rapid clinical deterioration while waiting for remanufacture of bb2121 from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In order to avoid increased safety risk due to rapid 
progression and preserve bb2121 manufacturing slots for those subjects receiving an 
initial infusion, subjects must  have cryopreserved bb2121 product available in order to be 
candidates for retreat ment .

Summary of Changes BB2121- MM-001  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary  5 BB2121- MM- 001 Amendment No. 4.0 Final: 18 Jul 2019  • Updated guidance on type of bridging therapy that may be used prior to 
retreatment.  
To allow flexibility of treatment options for subjects who have progressed after initial bb2121 infusion and are at risk of rapid disease progression , there is no longer a 
restriction of drug classes that may be used for bridging therapy prior to retreatment.  The 
restriction of drug classes that may be used for bridging therapy prior to initial bb2121 
infusion remains the same.  
o Revised Sections: Protocol Summary , Section 3.1. Study Design, and Section 
7.2.3. Retreatment 
• Updated Inclusion Criteria #8.  
Updated inclusion criteria #[ADDRESS_1101632] characteristics 
(SMPC) pregnancy guidance for cyclophosphamide. In addition, the update eliminates 
the exemption from using contraception, abstaining from breastfeeding, and refraining from tissue donation based on testing for absence of residual bb2121 CAR T cell 
persistence. There is no assay commercially available to support patient management for 
this clinical application, and so it has been removed from this guidance. Clarified that 
there are insufficient exposure data  to provide any recommendation concerning duration 
of contraception, abstaining from breastfeeding, and refraining from tissue donation 
following treatment with bb2121. Clarified the highly effective contraception methods: “tubal ligation” to “bilateral tubal ligation” and “partner’s vasectomy” to “successful 
vasectomy”.  
o Revised Section:  Section 4.2 Inclusion Criteria  
• Added footnote “hh” in Table 3 to clarify that an additional Unscheduled visit may be required  proximate to the primary analysis. 
For the completeness of key efficacy data at the time of data cutoff for the primary 
analysis, efficacy assessment s according to the International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG ) and survival sweep may be conducted in between scheduled visits and before 
the primary analysis data cut -off date.  
o Revised Section: Table 3: Table of Events  
• Removed requirement of sample collection for peripheral blood for immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_798597] 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36+. 
CAR+ T cells are no t detectable in  sufficient numbers by [CONTACT_798651][INVESTIGATOR_798598]. 
o Revised Section: Table 3: Table of Events and Table 5: Table of Events – 
Evaluations for Disease Progression after Month 24 
• Added an optional extramedullary plasmacytoma ( EMP ) biopsy.  
Added the optional EMP biopsy to Table 3 and Table 5 to distinguish the plasmacytoma biopsy from the tumor biopsy for second primary malignancies that was added in this 
amendment.

• Added tumor biopsy sample collection for second primary malignancies.  
Per FDA guidance, evaluation of potential CAR transgene involvement in the generation 
of second or new malignancies is suggested.   
o Revised Section:  Table 3: Table of Events, Table 5: Table of Events – Evaluations for Disease Progression after Month 24, and added new Section 6.3.7. Assessment at Time of Second Malignancy  
• Updated timing of the primary analysis from “6 months” to “10 months” after  
bb2121 infusion.  
The primary analysis will be performed [ADDRESS_1101633] response assessment 
at Month 1 (eg, at 10 months) based on Health Authority interactions. 
o Revised Sections:  Protocol Summary , Section 2. Study Objectives and 
Endpoints, Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Independent Response Committee (IRC) Assessment, and Section 9.12. Timing of Analysis   
• Updated Section 9.7.1. Assessment of MRD.  
Removed, “a flow MRD negative response, a sequencing MRD negative response, a sustained MRD negative response and an imaging plus MRD negative response, per 
IMWG Uniform Response Criteria will be summarized (Kumar, 2016).” These categories 
of MRD response are not being adjudicated  by [CONTACT_798652], will not be considered 
verified IMWG response categories. However,  assessment of MRD negative response 
and summarization of MRD negative rates for the bb2121-treated population and in 
subjects reaching select IMWG response categories will be performed.   
o Revised Section: Section 9.7.1. Assessment of MRD 
• Removed the sentence, “Response assessments will be made according to updated 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria 
for Multiple Myeloma (refer to Appendix B).”

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 BB2121 -MM-001 Amendment No. 2.0 Final: 14 June [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment include: 1) increase of the upper bound of the 
bb2121 dose range to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, 2) increase of the sample size to enroll up to 140 
subjects wi th up to 119 subjects treated with bb2121, 3) modificat ion of the bb2121 overdose 
definit ion, and 4) incorporation of feedback from health authorit ies.
bb2121 Dose Range Modification
The upper bound of the dose range is expanded from 300 x 106to 450 x 106CAR+ T cells. The 
rationale for thi s change to the dose range is based on the preliminary safet y and efficacy data in 
the phase 1 study , CRB -401 (n=43 subjects treated across the dose range of 50 - 800 x 106 CAR+ 
T cells) and preliminary  safety  data in this study (n=32 subjects treated across the dose range of 
150 - 300 x 106 CAR+ T cells).  
CRB -401: Summary  of Clinical Safet y Data
Updated informat ion, based on a data -cut-off of 29 March 2018, is available on 43 subjects 
enrolled in the dose escalat ion and expansio n phase softhePhase 1 study , CRB- 401. bb2121 
doses administered included: 50 (N = 3), 150 (N = 18), 200 (N = 1), 450 (N = 18) and 800 (N = 
3)x 106 CAR+ T cells . CRS of any grade was observed in 27 of 43 (63%) subjects with grade 3
CRS events reported in 2 of 43 subjects (4.6%). These included 1 reversible grade 3 CRS event 
at a dose of 450 and 800 x 106CAR+ T cells, respectively. No grade 4 CRS events were 
reported. The m edian time to onset of CRS was 2 days and median duration was 6 days. The 
overall frequency of CRS across the dose range of 150 to 450 x 106CAR+ T cells was 60%, 
including 39% at a dose of 150 x 106CAR+ T cells and 83% at a dose of 450 x 106CAR+ T 
cells. All cases of CRS were reversible. Neurotoxicit y of any grade was observed in 14 of 43 
(33%) subjects including one reversible grade 4 event (2.3%) and no grade 3 events. The overall 
frequency  of neurotoxi city across the d ose range of 150 to 450 x 106CAR+ T cells was 30% 
with a grade ≥ 3 frequency o f 2.7%. This includes an overall frequency  of 11% at a dose of 150 x 
106CAR+ T cel ls (with no grade ≥ 3 events ) and 5 0% at a dose of 450 x 106CAR+ T cells (with 
one grade ≥ 3 events, 5.6%). Nine subjects (21%) were treated with tocilizumab for grade 1 to 3 
CRS. Of these, four subjects (9%) received corticosteroids for management of CRS or 
neurotoxi city.All cases o f neurotoxi city were reversible.  For this analysis of neurotoxi city, a 
broad inclusio n of observed events within the neurologic System -Organ -Class (SOC) w ere
included ( preferred term s incl uding dizziness, bradyphrenia, somno lence, confusio nal state, 
nystagmus, inso mnia, memory impairment, depressed level of c onsci ousness, neurotoxi city, 
lethargy , trem or and hallucinat ion). Most neurologic events were grade 1/2 and likely  
multifactorial in nature, while only one grade ≥ 3 event cl early  attributable to CAR T cell 
associ ated encephal opathy  was reported. To addres s the grade ≥ 3neurotoxicit y event observed 
in CRB- 401, the CRB -401 and BB2121 -MM-001 protocol s were m odified to update the 
eligibilit y criteria to exclude pati ents wi th history  or presence of clinically  relevant central  
nervous system (CNS) pathology andthe protocol  safet y monitoring plan, i ncluding a mandatory  
14-day hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689], twi ce weekly  outpati ent visi ts in weeks 3 and 4 and a detailed CAR T

1Includes one subject treated with 200 x 106CAR+ T cells
Based on a data c ut-off o f [ADDRESS_1101647] 2 months of tumor response assessments or with disease 
progression wit hin 2 months. Of these, 33 were treated across the dose range of 150 to 450 x 106
CAR+ T cells .  
The reported overall tumor response rate (ORR) at doses of 150 to 450 x 106
CAR+ T cells in the [ADDRESS_1101648] s was 79% with a median duration o f response of 10.8 
months. A dose response was observed across the 150 to 450 x 106CAR+ T cell dose range wit h 
an ORR o f 57% at the 150 x 106CAR+ T cell dose and 95% at the 450 x 106CAR+ T cell dose. 
Within the act ive d ose cohorts (150 to 800 x 106CAR+ T cells) tumor response was more 
frequent in patients with CRS than without CRS (ORR 92% vs 55%, respectively).
These interim safet y data fro m this study  and f rom CRB -401 support a manageable safety  profile 
for bb2121 at doses up to 800 x 106CAR+ T cells. Furthermore, these data demonstrate a more 
favorable benefit:risk relat ionship at the higher end of the dose range and provide just ificat ion 
for the expansio n of the dose range to include 450 x 106CAR+ T cells.

Summary  of Changes BB2121 -MM-001 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 5 BB2121 -MM-001 Amendment No. 2.0 Final: [ADDRESS_1101649] ical power fo r the 
primary  and key  secondary  endpoint based on a composite analysis across the 150 to 450 x 106
CAR+ T cell dose range as well as increased nominal power for subgroup analyses of safet y and 
efficacy  within this revised dose range.
With this increase in sample size to i nclude up to [ADDRESS_1101650] ical 
power f orthe key  secondary endpoint of complete response (CR) rate (defined as the proporti on 
of subjects wi that least a com plete response) will be increased fro m 78% (in the origi nal 
protocol ) to approximately  89%, wi th the null  hypothesis of CR rate ≤ 10% and target CR rate ≥ 
20% at a one- sided 0.025 alpha level.
For the primary  endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) (defined as the proportion of subjects 
with at least a parti al response), with the same null hy pothesis of ORR ≤ 50% and the target 
ORR ≥ 70% as in the original protocol , a sam ple size of 119 bb2121 treated subjects would 
provi de >99% power at a one -sided 0.025 al pha. 
Modification of the bb2121 overdose definition
The protocol  defini tion of overdose (Secti on 7.6) for bb2121 is changed from > 10% to > 20% of 
the protocol specified dose to allow for the final product to be filled across the full protocol -
specified dose range of 150 – 450 x 106CAR+ T cells and delivered without the need for further 
manipulat ion at the clinical site post thaw prior to infusio n.
Given the expected variabilit y of +/-20% between estimated CAR+ cell count (on which product 
bags are filled) and final CAR+ cell count (on which administered CAR + cell dose i s calculated), 
extensio n of the definit ion of overdose to > 20% will allow reliable delivery o f the filled product 
bags containing bb2121 cells wit h less need for post -thaw m anipulati on at the clinical site 
resul ting in greater qualit y control . The safet y profile of bb2121, including doses administered 
up to 800 x 106CAR+ T cells in the phase 1 CRB -401 tri al without establishment of a maximum 
tolerated dose, supports the safet y of extending the definit ion of overdose to > 20%. 
Incorporation of feedback from Health Authorities
The Sponsor is incorporating feedback received from healt h authorities in order to: 1) clarify 
selected screening exclusio n and lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy criteria, 2) add live vaccines to 
the list of prohibited medicat ions, 3) align pregnancy  monitoring wi th clinical  trials facili tation 
group (CTFG) guidelines, and 4) remove the option for repeat leukapheresis for those re-treated 
with bb2121.

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 BB2121 -MM-001 Amendment No. 1.0 Final: [ADDRESS_1101670] bb2121 infusio n in 
the context of Grade 3 tumor lysis syndro me (TLS) and Grade 1 cytokine release syndro me 
(CRS) has been reported. The subject experienced rapid onset of neurotoxi city associ ated wi th 
cerebral edema andsubarachno id hemorrhage, rising C -reactive protein associated with CRS ,
and mixed respi[INVESTIGATOR_798599], and acute ki dney injury associ ated wi th TLS . 
Management including mechanical vent ilation, hemodialysis ,tocilizumab and 
methylpredniso lone. The event was reversible with complete resol ution of  neurotoxici ty, TLS 
and CRS.  
Based on this case, the bb121 -MM- 001 protocol  will be amended to include addit ional safet y 
mitigation and management. 
In addit ion, updates to the background informat ion on the CRB -401 tri al data and rati onale for 
the proposed dose range are included and several addit ional corrections and clarificat ions are 
made throughout the protocol.
Significant changes included in this amendment ar e summarized below:
Rationale for study design section modified to include updated CRB -[ADDRESS_1101671] a 14 J uly 2017 data cutoff including 
outcom e data on 18 subjects treated at doses above 5 x 107CAR+ T cells and addit ional MRD 
data on a total of [ADDRESS_1101672] ifythe selected dose range of 15 to 30 x 107CAR+ T cells.
Revised Sect ion: Section [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for the Study  Design, Secti on 1.3.[ADDRESS_1101673] ion 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria updated
Theexclusion criteria have been updated to exclude subjects with previous history  of 
subarachno id hemorrhage or other central  nervous system  (CNS )bleed and to exclude subjects
on therapeutic ant icoagulation due to the increased risk o f coagul opathy  and blee ding associated 
with CRS and neurotoxi city. 
In addit ion, subjects with Waldenstroms, POEMS (polyneuropathy , organom egaly, 
endocrinopathy , monocl onal protein, and skin change) or clinically significant amylo idosis will 
also be excluded to enhance the ho mogeneit y of the bb2121 treated population.

 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable University of Pennsylvania 
Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including [as applicable include the following regulations as they apply 
[ADDRESS_28188] commonly diagnosed class of disorders, with 
1 in 5 individuals diagnosed annually, less than 50% of these patients receive treatment, 
and less than 15% receive minimally adequate treatment (Kessler & Chiu, 2005) . 
Although extensive research has linked subcortical structures like the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to the hyperarousal symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_28898], hyperarousal is only one facet of the symptom profile shared across anxiety disorders. Much less is known about the cognitive symptoms (i.e. difficulty concentrating) experienced by [CONTACT_28898]. Given the low level of understanding of basic anxiety mechanisms, it is understandable that the most commonly used pharmacological treatments (e.g. benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_28875]) for anxiety were developed more than 20 years ago, with little advancement since. Accordingly, there is a critical need for mechanistic research into the CNS mechanisms that mediate the 
cognitive symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_28898]. Without such research, treatment development for these disorders will continue to be slow.   
TMS is approved by [CONTACT_4760] a second- line treatment for depression (Horvath, 
Mathews, Demitrack, & Pascual -Leone, 2010; O’Reardon et al., 2007; Shajahan et al., 
2002; Stern, Tormos, Press, Pearlman, & Pascual -Leone, 2007) , and some studies have 
shown that TMS can reduce comorbid symptoms of anxiety in depressed individuals (Mantovani, Aly, Dagan, Allart, & Lisanby, 2013; O’Reardon et al., 2007; White & Tavakoli, 2015). TMS uses a strong and alternating magnetic field at the scalp to induce electrical currents in neurons just below the TMS coil. Theta- burst stimulation (TBS) , 
where high frequency bursts (50 hz triplets) are delivered at the theta frequency (5 Hz), is capable of altering the resting membrane potentials of local neurons  (Lefaucheur et al., 
2014) . Continuous TBS (cTBS) tends to decrease local excitability, while intermittent TBS 
(iTBS) tends to increase local excitability (Lefaucheur et al., 2014) . TMS treatment 
protocols for depression are based on the hypothesis that the left dlPFC is associated with positive thoughts, and is hypoactive in depression (Berman, Doran, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_28876], & Weinberger, 1993; Galynker et al., 1998; Miller, Crocker, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_28877], Infantolino, & Heller, 2013) , while the right dlPFC is associated with negative thoughts and is hyperactive in 
depression (valence model) (Davidson, 2004). Thus, successful rTMS treatments for depression typi[INVESTIGATOR_28878] (Chen et al., 2013; Concerto et al., 2015; Fox, Buckner, White, Greicius, & Pascual -Leone, 2012; Horvath et al., 2010; Lefaucheur et al., 2014; Miniussi et al., 
2005; Nauczyciel et al., 2011; O’Reardon et al., 2007; Shajahan et al., 2002; Stern et al., 2007)  (or both), however other paradigms have also shown benefit (e.g. excitatory  of both 
right and left dlPFC).  
There is evidence that rTMS treatment protocols (based on the valence model) may 
be effective at treating anxiety symptoms comorbid with depression. For instance, excitatory  stimulation to the left dlPFC (O’Reardon et al., 2007) , inhibitory  stimulation to 
the right dlPFC (Mantovani et al., 2013) , and combined right inhibitory rTMS and left

 excitatory rTMS to the dlPFC (White & Tavakoli, 2015)  can reduce anxiety or panic in 
depressed individuals. However, several recent meta- analyses have concluded that there 
is little support for the efficacy of these treatments for anxiety reduction in non- depressed 
individuals (Lefaucheur et al., 2014; Pallanti & Bernardi, 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_28879], Loo, & Sachdev, 
2008; Zwanzger, Fallgatter, Zavorotnyy, & Padberg, 2009). One possible reason for this 
lack of support is that the underlying neuropathology mediating generalized anxiety and depression- related anxiety is fundamentally different (Baeken et al., 2010; Moulier et al., 
2016; Zwanzger et al., 2014), suggesting a need for the development of novel, anxiety -
specific rTMS treatment parameters. For instance, although excitatory stimulation to the left dlPFC facilitates retrieval of positive information in high anxious individuals (Balconi & Ferrari, 2012, 2013a, 2013b), excitatory stimulation to the left dlPFC does not reduce anxiety in non- depressed individuals (Moulier et al., 2016) . Similarly, treatment with 
inhibitory stimulation to the right dlPFC enhances rather than suppresses subsequent visual processing of fearful stimuli (Zwanzger et al., 2014), while excitatory stimulation to the right dlPFC reduces subsequent amygdala activity to negative faces (Baeken et al., 2010) . Taken together, these results suggest that the valence model may not be sufficient 
to explain the symptoms of anxiety in non- depressed individuals.  
Instead, we propose a novel hypothesis based on the frontoparietal attention network 
(FPN; Figure 1) (Cole, Repovš, & Anticevic, 2014). According to our model, 1) elevated state anxiety enhances bottom -up 
attentional processes, and 2) top- down cognitive control 
processes, mediated by [CONTACT_28899], counteract this enhancement, reducing anxiety. This model is an extension of the attenti on control theory, which states that anxious 
individuals cannot efficiently engage goal -directed attention 
(Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, 2007). Support for this model comes from the observations that 1) the right dlPFC plays a key role in attention control (Basten, Stelzel, & Fiebach, 2012; Cieslik et al., 2013; Fales et al., 2008; Harding, Yücel, Harrison, Pantelis, & Breakspear, 2015; Peers, Simons, & Lawrence, 2013), and 2) anxiety patients are impaired in their ability to recruit this structure for cognitive control (Armstrong, Zald, & Olatunji, 2011; Berggren & Derakshan, 2013a, 2013b; Braver, Cole, & Yarkoni, 2010; Coombes, Higgins, Gamble, Cauraugh, & Janelle, 2009; Derryberry & Reed, 2002; Eysenck et al., 2007; Grillon, Robinson, Mathur, & Ernst, 2015; Morrison & Heimberg, 2013; Najmi, Kuckertz, & Amir, 2012; Najmi, Amir, Frosio, & Ayers, 2014; Price, Eldreth, & Mohlman, 2011; Reinholdt -Dunne, Mogg, & 
Bradley, 2009, 2012). This model is also supported by [CONTACT_28900], 1) cognitive tasks that occur during periods of elevated state anxiety recruit the right dlPFC, 2) tasks that engage the right dlPFC reduce state anxiety (Balderston, Quispe- Escudero, et al., 2016; Vytal, Cornwell, 
Arkin, & Grillon, 2012; Vytal, Cornwell, Letkiewicz, Arkin, & Grillon, 2013) , 3) anxiety 
patients are less able to recruit the right dlPFC during demanding cognitive tasks (Balderston, Vytal, et al., 2016). Therefore, according to our model, we expect that enhancing activity in the right dlPFC with excitatory i TBS should facilitate top- down 
cognitive control processes associated with anxiety reduction. In addition, data suggest that activating the stimulation site via task engagement can facilitate the effect of rTMS (Luber et al., 2007, 2008, 2013), suggesting that rTMS during a challenging cognitive task may be more effective at anxiety reduction than rTMS alone.  
This research is significant because upon completion, we expect to have direct 
evidence for a causal role of the right dlPFC in anxiety regulation, complete with evidence

 of target engagement through simultaneous TMS/fMRI, and a novel application to anxiety. 
This research will lay the groundwork for my long -term career objective , which is to 
develop an independent, NIH -funded research program employing psychophysiology, 
neuroimaging, and neuromodulation in healthy and anxious participants aimed at 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a circuit -level understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying 
anxiety.  
2 Study Objectives  
 
Aim 1: Determine the effect of a 1- week course of TBS  treatment ( Continuous vs. 
Intermittent; right dlPFC target) on anxiety using the unpredictable shock -threat 
paradigm. Our hypothesis , consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], is that strengthening circuits 
in the right dlPFC will facilitate anxiety regulation. Accordingly, we expect excitatory 
but not inhibitory TBS (compared to sham) to reduce induced anxiety.  
 
Aim 2: Determine the effect of a 1- week course of TBS treatment (Continuous vs. 
Intermittent; right dlPFC target) on anxiety -related WM -deficits using the Sternberg 
WM paradigm during threat of shock. Our hypothesis  is that the rTMS will strengthen 
right dlPFC circuits, which will rescue the anxiety -related WM deficits. Accordingly, we 
expect that 10 Hz rTMS (compared to sham) will improve accuracy on the Sternberg WM task during threat.  
 
Aim 3: Demonstrate target engagement by [CONTACT_28901]. Our hypothesis  is that direct 
stimulation of the right dlPFC will reduce ongoing anxiety -related activity. Accordingly, 
we expect active but not sham TMS pulses to the right dlPFC to evoke BOLD deactivations in regions of the fear/anxiety network (i.e. amygdala, BNST, anterior insula).  
 
[ADDRESS_28189] the effects of this 
stimulation on anxiety -related WM deficits using the Sternberg WM paradigm.  In addition, 
we will also administer several self -report questionnaires to assess their baseline (pre-
stimulation) anxiety. Subjects will be randomly assigned to groups, and the order of stimulation (active vs. sham) will be counterbalanced across subject s. Aim 3 will be tested 
using a within- subjects design where this same group of subjects will receive single- pulse 
active and sham stimulation to the right dlPFC during the NPU threat task while in the MRI scanner. BOLD activity to the TMS pulses will be the primary outcome measure.  
 Subjects will undergo 12 study visits spaced over a 4- week period (Figure 3). Subjects 
may also be offered an optional 13
th visit where TMS/fMRI is conducted. On Week 1,

 subjects will undergo a pre- stimulation behavioral visit where they complete the NPU 
threat task and the Sternberg WM paradigm, and a pre- stimulation MRI visit where they 
undergo all the structural and functional imaging needed to identify the optimal target of 
stimulation for the course of TMS used in Aims 1 and 2. This information will be used to perform neuronavigation during the study visits to ensure accurate target stimulation. Subjects will complete the TMS/fMRI scans needed for Aim [ADDRESS_28190] visit, where they will complete 
the NPU threat task and the Sternberg WM paradigm.  
 
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
 Participants will be recruited from the community via paper or web ads, flyers, and 
listserv announcements. Participants will be recruited without any preference based on gender, race, religion, or other social variables. All recruitment materials (paper or web ads, flyers and listserv announcements) will be IRB approved prior to use.  
Study members authorized by [CONTACT_28902]. All study investigators obtaining informed consent complete formal informed consent training. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their  
comprehension of the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions regarding this study prior to si gning. Consent 
forms will be signed in the presence of a witness.  
Subjects will be informed that they can withdraw from the study whenever they wish. 
The experiment will also be stopped for any subject who exhibits signs of distress during any phase of the study. Subjects will be constantly monitored by [CONTACT_5984]. The subject will be withdrawn at any time if unable to follow the rules for participation in this study.

 dlPFC will facilitate anxiety regulation. Accordingly, we expect excitatory but not inhibitory  
TBS (compared to sham) to reduce induced anxiety.  
 
Aim 2:  Determine the effect of a 1- week course of rTMS TBS treatment (Continuous vs. 
Intermittent; right dlPFC target) on anxiety -related WM -deficits using the Sternberg WM 
paradigm during threat of shock. Our hypothesis is that the rTMS will strengthen right dlPFC circuits, which will rescue the anxiety -related WM deficits. Accordingly, we expect 
that iTBS (compared to sham) will improve accuracy on the Sternberg WM task during 
threat.  
 Aim 3:  Demonstrate target engagement by [CONTACT_28903]. Our hypothesis is that direct stimulation of the right dlPFC will reduce ongoing anxiety -related activity. Accordingly, we expect 
active but not sham TMS pulses to the right dlPFC to evoke BOLD deactivations in 
regions of the fear/anxiety network (i.e. amygdala, BNST, anterior insula).  
4 Study Population and Duration of Participation

4.[ADDRESS_28192] Recruitment  
 
Participants will be recruited from the community via paper or web ads, flyers, and listserv announcements. Participants will be recruited without any preference based on gender, race, religion, or other social variables. All recruitment materials (paper or web ads, flyers and listserv announcements) will be IRB approved prior to use.  
 
In order to facilitate the enrollment of interested subjects in multiple studies at the Center 
for Neuromodulation in Depression and Stress (CNDS), we utilize a general pre-screening form (either administered by [CONTACT_28904] -report depending on participant 
preference) center -wide as the majority of our projects closely relate, in both purpose and 
eligibility criteria.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_28193] availability . Subjects may also be offered 3 optional visits . 
TMS/fMRI will be conducted during the first optional visit. The NPU will be administered before and after cTBS during the second and third optional visits. If subjects choose to participate in the optional visits. Their study participation will be extended approximately [ADDRESS_28194] approximately 2- 3 hours.  
4.5 Total Number of Subjects and Sites  
 The target number of completers will be N=56 . We anticipate that about 20 % of subjects 
(N=11) will terminate the study during the task because of discomfort  and another 10% 
(N = 5) to withdraw due to scheduling issues. An additional 3 subjects per experiment (n=3) will be included for pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882].  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
 
All subjects must be able to provide their own consent. This study is above minimal risk 
and we do not want to enroll participants who do not understand the risk/benefit ratio of the study, particularly when there is no benefit to the participants. For thi s reason we 
exclude people with IQ lower than 80. We exclude and rule out pregnant women because of the unknown effects of the shocks and of the fMRI on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. We exclude non-English speakers since not all the instruments and test we use are translated and 
validated in Spanish or other languages. Based on our experience, we made the decision that 50 would be the upper age limit to prevent age- related changes in brain structure and 
function from confounding our analyses. Patients will not be t aken off medications for the 
purpose of the study.

5.1.9  Procedures  
 TMS motor threshold testing:  The resting motor threshold (MT) will be determined in 
order to find the safe TMS dosing level.  MT is defined as the minimum magnetic flux 
needed to elicit a threshold EMG response in a target muscle in [ADDRESS_28195] dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle will be measured with EMG.  The scalp region producing the largest amplitude MEP will be identified.  At that scalp location,  the lowest TMS intensity able to elicit 5 MEP's of ≥50µV in peak -to-peak 
amplitude in 10 trials at this site will be determined using a descending method of limits procedure.  
 Sternberg working memory task:  On each WM trial, subjects will see a series of 4 
letters presented singularly (encoding period) that will be followed by a brief interval where subjects are required to maintain these letters (maintenance period). At the end of the 
maintenance period, subjects will be prompted to make a response based on the task instructions (response period; Sternberg, 1966). The response prompt will consist of a letter and a number. The letter will be chosen from the study series, and the number will correspond to a position in the series. The subjects will indicate whether the position of the letter in the series matches the number.  
 There will be 2, 14 min runs of the experiment. Within each run, there will be 4 blocks (2 threat, 2 safe). Within each block, there will be 2 types of trials based on the delivery of startle probes. On each trial a startle probe will be presented either during the maintenance period or the ITI. There will be 6 trials per condition per block . There will be 
a total of 3 shocks per run presented at random points during the threat blocks.  
 NPU Task:  The instructed fear paradigm that will be implemented uses administration of 
predictable and unpredictable shocks to generate phasic and sustained forms of 
potentiated startle. We will use the NPU threat procedure as described in (Schmitz & 
Grillon, 2012) . The experiment consists of three different conditions: no shock (N), 
predictable shock (P), and unpredictable shock (U), each lasting approximately 150 sec. In the N condition, no shocks will be delivered. In the P condition, shocks will be administered predictably, that is, only in the presence of a threat cue. In the U condition, 
the shocks will be unpredictable. In each 150- sec condition, an 8- sec cue will be 
presented four times. The cues will be different geometric colored shapes in each

 condition (e.g., a blue square for N, a red circle for P, and a green star for U) presented 
on a computer monitor in front of the subjects. The cue will signal the possibility of receiving a shock only in the P condition. It has no signal value in the N and U conditions. Instructions will also be displayed on a computer monitor to inform subjects of the nature of current condition by [CONTACT_28908]: “no shock” (N), “shock only during shape” (P), or “shock at any time” (U). During each predictable and unpredictable condition, one shock will be administered during the cue in the predictable condition and in the absence of a cue in the unpredictable condition.  
 There will be 2, [ADDRESS_28196] visit. Within each run, there will be 8 blocks (2 predictable, 2 unpredictable, 4 neutral). There are twice the number of neutral blocks to ensure that safe blocks alternate with threat (predictable or unpredic table) blocks. 
Startle probes will be presented either during the cue period, or the ITI. During the predictable and unpredictable blocks, there will be 2 trials per condition. Given that there will be twice as many neutral blocks, during these blocks ther e will only be 1 trial per 
condition. There will be a total of 3 shocks per run presented during either the ITI (unpredictable) or cue (predictable) periods.   White noise habituation:  The acoustic startle stimuli will be a 40- ms burst of white noise 
(103 dB) with instantaneous rise time. Auditory stimuli will be delivered binaurally via headphones. The eyeblink component of the startle response will be measured by [CONTACT_28909] (EMG) activity of the left orbicularis oculi muscle. The 
session will begin with a startle habituation phase with 9 startle stimuli presented alone to reduce startle reactivity.  
 Shock workup:  Electric shocks will be delivered through two tin disk electrodes located 
on the median nerve of the right wrist with a current constant stimulator. During each test visit prior to the experiment, the subject will undergo a shock workup procedure to identify an appropriate shock level. During the workup, subjects will receive brief (100 ms) presentations of the shock starting at a low level (2 mA), which will be increased in intensity gradually, until it reaches a level that they rate as uncom fortable but tolerable. 
Shocks will be administered at that level during the visit . The subject will also be informed 
that they are free to withdraw from the experiment if they later determine that the shock level is too high.  
 Self-report Questionnaires:  Subjects will be asked to fill out self -report questionnaires 
during the experiments (i.e. TMS adult safety screen (Keel, Smith, & Wassermann, 2000) , 
the State Anxiety Scale (S -Anxiety) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], 1987) , the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck, 
Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988) , Retrospective Threat Questionnaire). During the test 
visits, subjects will be asked to retrospectively rate their fear and anxiety levels using an 
analog scale during each condition (Retrospective Threat Questionnaire). Retrospective 
measures of fear and anxiety will be collected on an analog scale ranging from 0 (not at 
all anxious) to 10 (extremely anxious).  This analog scale has been a reliable measure of anxiety in our past studies. The State Anxiety Scale (S -Anxiety) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], 1987)  a 20-
item self -administered rating scale with measures of mood .

They will receive a total of 600 pulses per session. Consistent with the iTBS condition,

 iTBS . Subjects will receive 20 trains of triplet 50 Hz bursts, repeated at 5 Hz; 2 s on and 
8 s off for a total of 600 pulses per session and a total duration of 3 min. and 9 s). Stimulation will occur while subjects are doing the Sternberg WM paradigm, which should facilitate the efficacy of the stimulation by [CONTACT_28910]-associate stimulation (C -PAS) principle (Luber et al., 2017) . The timing of the Sternberg 
task will be jittered so that each rTMS train will be administered during the maintenance interval of a WM trial.  
 Basic scans : During the MRI visit, we will collect at T1, a T2, and a diffusion- weighted 
echo- planar image using an available 3T scanner. Next subjects will undergo a two runs  
of the Sternberg task, without shocks, probes, or TMS pulses to serve as functional localizers to identify a dlPFC. Subjects may also undergo a resting state scan.  
 NPU TMS/fMRI.  A Magventure MagPro 100X stimulator with a MRi -B91 figure- 8 coil will 
be used. The TMS coil will be placed on the head over the target. TMS intensity will be 100% of the motor threshold (MT). For sham stimulation, a [ADDRESS_28197]’s scalp and the TMS coil. As with the study visits, subjects will have 
Neutral, Predictable, and Unpredictable periods. During the neutral periods, they will be safe from shocks. During the predictable periods, they can receive shocks but only when there is a cue present. During the unpredictable periods, they will be at risk for shock 
during the entire duration of the block. Rather than probing their ongoing fear and anxiety with the startle probes, we will replace the startle probes w ith single TMS pulses to the 
right dlPFC. This will allow us to causally examine the effect of right dlPFC activity (induced by [CONTACT_28911]) on the neural activity that mediates fear (during the predictable cue) and anxiety (during the unpredictable cue and ITI). Importantly, by 
[CONTACT_28912], it will be possible to directly compare the TMS -evoked BOLD responses to the pattern of startle responses collected during the 
MRI/pre -stimulation visit.  Subjects will have [ADDRESS_28198] is withdrawn from the study or decides to discontinue, they will be 
compensated for the visits they completed, and a note will be placed in their CRF.  
6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Primary Endpoint s 
 Aim 1: Determine the effect of a 1- week course of TBS treatment (Continuous 
vs. Intermittent; right dlPFC target) on anxiety using the Neutral, Predictable, and 
Unpredictable (NPU) shock -threat paradigm.   
Outcome measures. Fear potentiated startle (FPS) will be calculated by [CONTACT_28913] -trial interval (ITI) from the predictable cue. 
Anxiety potentiated startle (APS) will be calculated by [CONTACT_28914]. Online anxiety ratings will be processed 
similarly.  
Statistical Analysis. The main analysis will be a 3 [stimulation: pre- stimulation vs. 
post-active vs. post -sham] by 2 [ protocol : cTBS vs. iTBS ] repeated- measures ANOVA. In 
addition to the main factors considered, we may also co- vary out several individual 
difference measures (e.g. baseline anxiety via self -report questionnaires, counterbalance 
order, overall stimulation accuracy, and Sternberg w orking memory (WM) performance 
to assess target engagement).  
 Aim 2: Determine the effect of a 1 -week course of TBS treatment (Continuous 
vs. Intermittent ; right dlPFC target) on anxiety -related WM -deficits using the 
Sternberg WM paradigm during threat of shock.  
Outcome measures. During each Sternberg trial, subjects will see a series of 5 or 8 
letters presented singularly (encoding period) that will be followed by a brief interval where subjects are required to maintain these letters (maintenance period). At the end of the mainten ance period, subjects will indicate whether the position of the letter in the series 
matches the number. Accuracy will be scored as the percent correct for each trial type.  
Statistical Analysis. The main analysis will be a 3 [stimulation: pre- stimulation vs. 
post-active vs. post -sham] by 2 [ protocol: cTBS vs. iTBS ] repeated- measures ANOVA. 
As with Aim 1, we may also include several other individual difference measures as covariates in this analysis.  
 Aim 3: Demonstrate target engagement by [CONTACT_28915].   
Outcome measures. Standard Multi -echo fMRI preprocessing will be conducted 
using the AFNI software package. Steps include: slice- time correction, despi[INVESTIGATOR_28884], volume 
registration, TE -dependent ICA denoising (to remove non- BOLD artifacts), masking, 
blurring, scaling, motion sc rubbing, T1- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_28885], normalization (using MNI 
template). At the first level, variable duration mini -blocks will be used to model BOLD 
activity during the maintenance interval of the Sternberg trials. Motion parameters and all other events will be included in the model as regressors of no interest.  
Statistical Analysis. Whole- brain maps will be created for contrasts mirroring those 
used to create FPS and APS in Aim 1. FP -BOLD and AP -BOLD maps will then be 
analyzed using a paired- sample t -test to compare BOLD responses evoked by [CONTACT_28916]. Monte Carlo simulations will be conducted to cluster -correct the results using a voxelwise p- value threshold of 0.001, a 
cluster alpha of 0.05, and a realistic spatial autocorrelation function to model the noise. This is the s tandard approach implemented in AFNI following the influential Eklund et al. 
[ADDRESS_28199] size of (f=0.5). If we set power at  
0.[ADDRESS_28200]. Assuming a 15% unusable data rate and [ADDRESS_28201] available information at the time. To ensure that we are adequately powered across the study arms, and to account for additional dropout due to scheduling issues, we plan to recruit up to 75 participants.   
7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1  Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].

10 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government 
regulations and international standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable 
institutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted 
independent Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator 
and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study.  
10.1 Risks  
 
Clinical interview and assessments : There is minimal medical risk in completing the 
questionnaires. Some of the questions may make the participants feel uncomfortable or anxious. Participants may refuse to answer any question or to stop a test at any time and for any reason.  
 Auditory startle stimulus (i.e. loud noises):  The auditory stimuli that will be used in 
the startle studies are 40- ms duration 102 dB white noise. Auditory startling sounds of 
much higher intensities are frequently used in startle studies. Sounds of higher intensities and longer duration are also widely used in aversive conditioning in human subjects, where they serve as unconditioned stimuli. The short duration (40 ms) of these sounds makes them safe (i.e., there is no danger of hearing impairment). In addition, a white noise is safer than a pure tone. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_28889] 200 subjects with no adverse reactions. The auditory stimulus may trigger a migraine.  
 Psychophysiological  (Blink)  recording: The psychophysiological measures that will 
be obtained are non- invasive, requiring the administration of no needles, drugs, or dyes. 
Little discomfort is expected. During electrode placement, the possibility of skin irritation from contact [CONTACT_28924]. However, this is unlikely as the salt concentration of the paste is similar to that of human sweat.  
 Electric shock:  The shocks will be delivered through two disk electrodes located on 
the subject’s left wrist . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_28890]. The shock is 
generally described by [CONTACT_28925]. The mean rating of aversiveness on a scale of 1 (not painful at all) to 10 (extremely painful) is about 5. Over 95% of subjects who e xperienced the shock chose to participate in the experiment.  
In very rare occasions, subjects have experienced symptoms that may be related to 
the shock. A  participant with a condition called “ cubital tunnel syndrome,” a repetitive 
motion injury similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, indicated worsening of his syndrome over the months subsequent to his participation. Another participant reported pain in her arms for several hours after testing. The pain was no longer present the next day. It is unclear whether these symptoms were due to the shocks. Nevertheless, subjects  with 
neurological symptoms of the wrist and arms will be excluded from the study.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.   
 MRI: MRI is widely regarded as a safe, noninvasive procedure for visualization of brain 
tissue. The risks involved with fMRI are the same as those involved in standard anatomic 
MRI, since these three procedures rely on the same physical properties of brain tiss ue. 
This study will be performed on an FDA approved 3T scanner. MRI at 3 Tesla is a routine clinical procedure, and issues regarding radio frequency deposition, time varying magnetic fields, and the static field at 3 Tesla do not require detailed discussion.  
 
Likely/ Common:   
• Because the MRI scanner is a narrow space, subjects may experience claustrophobia, or a fear of enclosed spaces and/or anxious feelings accompanied by [CONTACT_28926].  
• Additionally, the scanner produces a loud repetitive knocking noise during the study that some people find bothersome. To lessen the noise, earplugs will be provided.  
 Rare:  
• The MRI scanner has a strong magnet which attracts certain metals. As a result, the MRI will not be performed on anyone having these types of metal in their body. This includes metallic fragments and certain implanted medical devices, such as: Pacemakers, Internal Cardiac Defibrillators, Insulin Pumps, and other 
medical devices. Implanted medical devices and metallic foreign fragments inside the subject may pose a risk if they were to enter the MRI magnet room. Therefore, questions regarding medical and wor k history will be asked prior to 
the exam to ensure subjects do not have any of these metallic fragments in their body  
• Flying Objects: The known risks associated with this study are minimal. The greatest risk is a magnetic object flying through the air toward the magnet and 
hitting the subject. To reduce this risk we require that all people involved with the study remove all magnetic metal from their clothing and all magnetic metal objects from their pockets. No magnetic metal objects are allowed to be brought into the magnet room at any time except by [CONTACT_28927]. To prevent any injury to patients and staff and any damage to the MRI scanner, subjects will be asked to remove all jewelry and clothing containing metal before they enter the MRI scan room. Also, since the MRI magnet will erase credit cards, they must not be taken into the scan room. In addition, once they  are in the magnet, the 
door to the room will be closed so that no one inadvertently walks into the room.  
• Some dyes in tattoos and permanent eyeliner contain metals which may heat up during the MRI scan. This can cause the area with the tattoo to become irritated and swollen.    
• It is possible that during the course of the research study, the research staff may notice an unexpected finding. Should this occur, the finding will be considered by [CONTACT_28928] [INVESTIGATOR_12606]. These possible findings may  or may not be significant, but could lead to anxiety about the 
condition and to further evaluation by [CONTACT_9682].  
• Although there are no known risks related to MRI on pregnant women or a fetus, there is a possibility of yet undiscovered pregnancy related risks. Since there is no possible benefit from participating in this protocol for a pregnant woman, we will exclude pregnant women. All women of childbearing potential will be asked to 
CONFIDENTIAL

 confirm before entering the MRI scanner that they are not pregnant at the time. 
Implantable contraceptives are generally very safe for MRI, but the MRI technician may ask the subject additional questions before entering the MRI suite to ensure their safety . 
 
TMS: When used in accordance with the safety guidelines, there are no known long-
term risks associated with TMS (Rossi, Hallett, Rossini, & Pascual- Leone, 2009) . A recent 
consensus safety report summarized the likelihood and factors contributing to the 
recorded occurrences of seizure (Rossi et al., 2009) . As of 2008, there were only 16 cases 
of seizure reported in the preceding 20 years of research. Seven of these occurrences occurred prior to the development of rigorous safety guidelines implemented in 1997, which govern stimulator intensity, pulse frequency, train duration, inter -train intervals. 
According to the consensus report, when used according to the safety guidelines the occurrence of seizure is rare, and the few new cases involve “TMS protocols exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients un der treatment with drugs which potentially lowered 
the seizure threshold” (Rossi et al., 2009) . While there are no known long- term adverse 
effects reported with the use of this device, there may be unforeseen risks in the long-term that are currently unknown.   
 
Likely/ Common:   
• The most common side effect of TMS is a mild headache,  jaw pain , or other facial 
discomfort , which approximately 25% of patients experience. We will demonstrate 
TMS at the initial screening visit to make sure the subject is comfortable receiving this 
procedure. The TMS that will be used in this research is not expected to carry any more than the limited potential for these risks listed above.  
 
Rare:  
• Subjects may experience temporary and local bruising, swelling or pain from the swim cap and/ or muscle activation by [CONTACT_7712].  
• Although uncommon, some subjects have experienced nausea during the experiment.  
• In patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], TMS could result in a seizure.  Patients with stroke may also be at increased risk for a seizure due to brain scarring. Therefore, those with history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_28891]. For a typi[INVESTIGATOR_28892], producing a seizure from TMS in this experiment is very unlikely.  
• The TMS device produces a clicking sound. Although studies have found no hearing impairments as a result of this sound, some subjects’ experience a mild temporary effect on their hearing. To minimize this possibility, you will be given protective earplugs.   
• Objects such as watches and credit cards should be removed as these could be damaged.  
• The effects of TMS on a fetus are unknown. Therefore, we require that females of child-bearing potential attest at the time of participation that they are not pregnant.  
 
Alternatives to participation: The studies proposed in this project do not involve an 
intervention, so the participants will not directly benefit from the research. Therefore, there 
are no alternatives to participation. However, participants will be free to withdraw from the

 study without consequence.  
 
Protections against risk  
 
Electric Shock:  Shock will be delivered at a level that is judged by [CONTACT_28929]. Study shock levels will be determined before the test begins. The subject may stop the experiment at any time if they find the discomfort to be too great.  
 TMS: To minimize the likelihood of seizures we will 1) conform to the guidelines set in 
the workshop convened by [CONTACT_28930] (NINDS) in 1996 (Rossi et al., 2009) , and 2) screen subjects for risk factors using the 
TMS adult safety screen questionnaire (Keel et al., 2000) . In addition, we will train all 
personnel to recognize potential seizures, and administer appropriate care. In the event that the TMS operator observes symptoms of a seizure he or she will 1) stop the protocol and inquire about the subject’s well -being, 2) apply first -aid if the subject is unresponsive, 
3) ensure the subject is physically safe for the duration of the seizure, 4) call 911. If the subject develops a headache during or immediately after the stimulation, this will be managed with over -the-counter pain medication. To minimize the likelihood of hearing 
loss or tinnitus, subjects will wear hearing protection for the duration of the rTMS session. Risks to the unborn children of pregnant women receiving MRI and TMS are unknown. Pregnant women will b e excluded as per IRB policy.  
MRI: The potential risks related to MRI will be minimized as follows: 1) Claustrophobia 
associated with MRI will be reduced by [CONTACT_28931]; and 2) a possible history of any intraocular, intra- aural, 
intracranial, or intrathoracic metal will exclude the subject from the study. Earplugs will be given to each subject to wear during the scan to minimize discomfort and prevent any adverse effects on hearing resulting from the scanning procedure.  
A radiology technologist (or trained individual authorized to run the scanner) and a 
clinician will be present throughout the MRI study in case medical emergencies would 
arise. During MRI scanning, the subject can communicate with the control room personnel via an intercom at the operating console. Thus, the subject can be removed immediately from the MRI scanner, if necessary.  
10.[ADDRESS_28205] commonly diagnosed class of disorders, 
with 1 in 5 individuals diagnosed annually, less than 50% of these patients receive 
treatment, and less than 15% receive minimally adequate treatment (Kessler & Chiu, 2005) . Although extensive research has linked subcortical structures like the amygdala 
and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to the hyperarousal symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_28898], hyperarousal is only one facet of the symptom profile shared across anxiety disorders. Much less is known about the cognitive symptoms (i.e. difficulty concentrating) experienced by [CONTACT_28898].

10.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
 
Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_28932], postdoctoral fellows, a graduate student or the principal investigator. Because this study does not involve treatment, coercion is not a concern. Consent will be obtained in a private room where study staf f 
members can explain the purpose of the fMRI and what it will add to our knowledge of TMS, neuroscience and cognitive processes. They will explain that participating is completely voluntary and that not participating will not change access to treatment in  any 
way. The potential participant will be given the option to consider study enrollment and will not be forced to make a decision the same day. If they decide to participate, a combined consent and HIPAA form will be signed by [CONTACT_28933]. The 
patient will be reminded before and after enrolling, and before any research procedure that their participation is optional and has no impact on the care they can expect.

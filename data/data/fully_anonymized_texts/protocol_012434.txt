1. BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
Anemia and red blood cells (RBC) transfusions are common in critically ill patients.1,2 One factor 
associated with the development of anemia3,4 and RBC transfusions5,6 in these patients is the volume of 
diagnostic phlebotomy. Therefore, a more efficient use of blood drawn for diagnostic testing has the 
potential to reduce transfusions.  
 
Even though blood conserving strategies could be beneficial, there are no randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) assessing their efficacy in reducing RBC transfusions in adults. A blood conserving arterial line 
system reduced the RBC transfusion volume in an RCT of very low birth weight infants.[ADDRESS_543358] trial showed no benefit, but the intervention was limited to basic metabolic profile 
tubes and the study was conducted in a general Internal Medicine population.8 The second trial, 
performed  in  the  Intensive  Care  Unit  (ICU)  setting,  demonstrated  a  reduction  in  the  decline      of

3.3 Allocation  
 
All patients admitted to the medical or transplant ICU will be screened for eligibility. Group 
assignment will be done using the randomization module in the Research electronic data  
capture (RedCap). Randomization will be str atified by [CONTACT_429316] (7 to 9.49 
g/dL, 9.5 to 11.99 g/dL, and 12 g/dL or greater). Patients will be randomized using permuted 
blocks of 4 or 6 and a 1 to 1 ratio, into one of two groups: the pediatric size phlebotomy tubes 
group or the adult size phlebotomy tubes  group.  
 
3.4 Interventions  
 
Pre-intervention period (1 month)  
 
The first objective of this period is to standardize the pediatric tubes phlebotomy process. Study 
procedures will be presented to the ICU nurses by [CONTACT_6968], printed material, and lectures. 
Information will include the type of pediatric tube and the blood vo lume needed for each test, 
and the importance to collect only the total estimated blood volume according to the tests that 
need to be performed. Pocket size cards that include the suggested volume of blood to be 
drawn for each pediatric tube will be provid ed. No guidance regarding the phlebotomy process 
when using adult size tubes will be given so that it reflects usual practice.      The volume of fluid  
Page 5 of 8 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-17-0280  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/28/2017   drawn to clear the intravenous line will be returned to the patient in a sterile fashion i n both 
groups whenever possible. The frequency and type of blood tests performed will follow usual 
practice.  
 
The second objective of the pre -intervention period is to provide RBC transfusions 
recommendations to the ICU physicians. This will be accomplishe d by [CONTACT_429317]. An RBC transfusion will be recommended if the 
hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL or if there is bleeding with associated hemodynamic instability 
regardless of the hemoglobin level. It wi ll be dependent upon the ICU physician to make the  
final  determination  regarding  the need  of any transfusions.  
 
Intervention period (5 -11 months)  
 
Blood tests will be collected using pediatric and adult phlebotomy tubes in the experimental and 
control gro ups, respectively (Table 1).  Arterial blood gases, blood cultures, and lactate levels  
will be collected using the same tubes in both groups. The exposure period will be from 
randomization until the hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, an RBC transfusion order  is placed, the 
patient is discharged from the ICU (time of an acceptance note) or dies (time of death), clinical 
bleeding or surgery occur, comfort care measures only are initiated, or the patient stays in the 
ICU for more than 30 consecutive  days.  
 
3.5 Outco mes  
 
Primary  
The primary outcome will be the time from randomization to hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL or 
RBC transfusion  order.  
 
Secondary  
The main secondary outcome will be the rate of change in hemoglobin (g/dL/patient/day) in the 
ICU.  This will be calculated as the most recent hemoglobin prior to randomization minus the  
last hemoglobin prior to ICU discharge, death, RBC transfusion, clin ical bleeding, surgery, or 
change of clinical status to comfort measures, divided by [CONTACT_7459] (rounded to the 
nearest 0.5) between these two values (crude estimate). If the longitudinal measures of 
hemoglobin levels deviate substantially from a l inear trajectory, we will use a growth model to 
capture the best fitting function of time (see Analysis Plan for details) and generate a predicted 
rate of  change.  
 
Other secondary outcomes will be the proportion of participants receiving an RBC transfusion  
while in the ICU, the proportion of patients with at least one inadequate blood sample for 
laboratory analysis, and the ICU mortality. An inadequate blood sample is defined as any blood 
sample that requires recollection.  
 
The patient’s admission height an d weight will be used to estimate the total blood volume of 
each patient based on Nadler’s equation.[ADDRESS_543360].

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/28/2017   3.6 Blinding  
 
The primary outcome assessors will be blinded to the intervention assignments. Study 
participants, nurses, and physicians will not be blinded.  
 
3.7 Analysis  plan  
 
Baseline variables (e.g. gender, race, age) be tween groups will be examined for clinically 
significant differences that may have occurred by [CONTACT_3364]. If a clinically significant difference is 
noted, both unadjusted and adjusted analyses will be performed.  
 
Intent -to-treat analyses will be used. The pri mary outcome will be assessed using time to event 
analysis with the Cox proportional hazard model including treatment group and ICU admission 
hemoglobin level group (stratifying variable). Censoring events will be death, ICU discharge, 
clinical bleeding, s urgery, initiation of comfort care measures, and end of the study. We will 
report the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI).  
 
We will assess whether the longitudinal measures of hemoglobin follow a linear trajectory. If 
they substantially deviate, we will employ multilevel mixed models including a quadratic term  
for time or splines to capture the non -linear change while accounting for within -subject 
correlation. We will generate predicted rates of change to compare between the study  groups.  
 
To compare the rate of change in hemoglobin (either crude or predicted) between the two  
study groups, a linear regression model will be used with treatment and ICU admission 
hemoglobin groups as covariates. Multiple regression analysis will be used to ass ess the 
relationship between the rate of change in hemoglobin as the dependent variable, and age, 
admission hemoglobin, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, acute 
or chronic renal disease, sepsis admission diagnosis, use of med ications that can cause bleeding, 
intervention group, and ICU admission hemoglobin group as independent variables. Proportions 
of RBC transfusion and proportions of at least one inadequate blood sample will be compared 
among the two groups using logistic r egression models with treatment group and ICU admission 
hemoglobin level group as  covariates.  
 
Sample Size  
 
It is estimated that the primary outcome will occur in about 20 -40% of the participants in the 
control group.1,2,6,12 -14 A total of 200 patients (10 0 in each group) will be randomized in the  
study. This number of participants was chosen to allow completion of the study in a reasonable 
time frame while obtaining preliminary information to estimate an unbiased treatment effect. 
This sample size allows a reasonable width of the 95% CI for the rate of the primary outcome in 
each group (+/ - 8%).  
 
 
3.8 Study  duration  
 
It is estimated that about 6 to 12 months will be needed to complete this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This 
estimate takes into account the pre -intervention peri od (1 month). No more than 5 patients per  
Page 7 of 8 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-17-0280  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/28/[ADDRESS_543361] not shown a difference in the number of insufficient samples between patients using 
adult or pediatric size tubes.15,16 
 
Participants that receive the other group’s intervention will remain in their assigned group for the 
duration of the trial.  These protocol deviations as well as instances of inadequate blood samples  
will be recorded  in the blood  tests  record  forms  by [CONTACT_473]  (Appendix).  
 
 
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND  ASSURANCE  
 
One investigator will be blinded to the group assignments. This researcher will determine when the 
study completion criteria has been met for each participant, the primary outcome, and the 
transfu sion related events.  
 
 
6. ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the 
general principles set forth in the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration  of 
Helsinki.  
 
Before implementing this study, the protocol and any other required information, must be reviewed 
and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB). Any amendments to the 
protocol, other than administrative ones, must be reviewed and app roved by [CONTACT_429318]. If an immediate change to the protocol is implemented for safety reasons by [CONTACT_1275], the IRB must be informed immediately.  
 
All patients admitted to the medical and transplant ICUs of Memorial Hermann Hospit al will be 
screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_429319].  
 
A waiver of informed consent and Health Insurance and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization are 
being sought. The study does not involve more than minimal risk, the waiver will not adversely  
affect the rights and welfare of the participants, and whenever appropriate, the participants will be 
provided with additional pertinent information after participation.  The probability and magnitude  
of harm or discomfort anticipated with the use of pediatric phlebotomy tubes is not greater than 
those of blood collection using adult phlebotomy tubes.  Blood is collected routinely in pediatric  
ICUs with the same tubes and processes that will be used in the experimental intervention gro up. 
Obtaining  informed  consent  and HIPAA  authorization  could  create  bias related  to the inclusion  of 
Page 8 of 8 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-17-0280  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/28/2017   healthier participants that are not representative of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_429314]. This could yield 
meaningless results.  
 
All records identifying the patient will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by 
[CONTACT_178066]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. The medical record number 
will be the only patient identifier that will be recorded. Pati ent names or any other  patient 
identifiers will not be supplied to third parties. A unique study specific number will be assigned to 
every participant. Records containing patient identifiers will be destroyed as soon as possible 
according to legal  regulat ions.  
 
 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND DATABASE  MANAGEMENT  
 
6.[ADDRESS_543362] and interv iew of the nurses. This 
information and data obtained from the patient’s electronic medical record will be entered 
directly in the RedCap database, a secure electronic database (Appendix).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_543363] forms wil l be stored in the locked research office.  
 
6.3 Patient  Identifiers  
 
The patient’s medical record number will be recorded on the blood tests record forms only. A 
study specific identifier will be given to each participant and will be used for identification in  the 
electronic database.  
 
6.4 Access to patient’s  information  
 
Only study investigators will have access to the paper and electronic patient’s information.  
 
 
8. PUBLICATION  PLAN  
 
The results of the study will be submitted for publication in scientific journals and/or scientific 
meetings. If the results of the study are published, the patient’s identity will remain confidential.

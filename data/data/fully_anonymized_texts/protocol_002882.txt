The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the efficacy, safet y, tolerabilit y, and 
pharmacokinetics of two doses of varenicline in adolescent smokers (12-19 years) in 
conjunction with age appropriate cessation counseling.  The treatment period will be twelve 
weeks and subjects’ smoking status will then be followed for approximately  nine months.
Background
Varenicline is a selective nicotinic acet ylcholine rece ptor (nAChR) partial agonist designed 
to have specific and potent binding at the 42receptor subtype which mediates the behavior 
reinforcing effects of nicotine.  Because of its mixed agonist-antagonist properties, 
varenicline offers the therapeutic bene fit of relieving s ymptoms of nicotine withdrawal and 
cigarette craving during abstinence while blocking the reinforcing effects of chronic nicotine .
Varenicline (Chantix/Champix) was approved as an “aid to smoking cessation treatment” 
in adults by  [CONTACT_38785] A in May  2006, and by  [CONTACT_897503] 2006, and is now 
approved in 9
8countries worldwide. The approved dose regimen is 1 mg twice dail y (1mg 
bid) for [ADDRESS_1258001] (PREA) include a study  to 
determine whether varenicline, as part of an overall smoking cessation program, is effective 
in achieving and maintaining smoking cessation in tobacco- addicted adolescents.  The 
current st udy isconsidered to be a post -authorization safet y study (PASS) in the adolescent 
population, an age group not included in the current labeling for varenicline.
Phase [ADDRESS_1258002] frequently  reported treatment- emerg ent 
adverse events associated with varenicline were nausea, sleep disturbance, constipation, 
flatulence and vomiting.1  Nausea was reported b y approximately 30% of patients treated 
with varenicline 1 mg BID afte r an initial week of dose titration compared with 10% in 
patients taking placebo.  In patients taking 0.5 mg BID following initial titration, the 
incidence was 16% compared with 11% for placebo.  Nausea was generall y described as 
mild or moderate and often transient
.[ADDRESS_1258003] recent Investigator Brochure (IB).
Rationale for this study
Most adult smokers initiated smoking as adolescents.  According to the CDC’s 2005 Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey ,223.0% of students in the [LOCATION_002] were current cigarette users 
(ie,had smoked cigarettes on more than one of the 30 day s preceding the survey ) and 
9.4% of students were curre nt frequent cigarette users (ie, had smoked cigarettes on 20 of 
the 30 day s preceding the survey ).  Among the students who reported current cigarette use,
10.7% had smoked at least 10 cigarettes/day  on the day s they  smoked during the 30 days 
preceding the survey  and 54.6% had tried to quit smoking cigarettes during the 12 months 
preceding the survey .  Continued smoking increases lifetime risk for various cancers, 
especiall y lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748] .3 
 Objective 27- 2 of 
the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy  People 2010 initiative is to 
reduce the prevalence of current cigarette use among high school students to 16%.4
The transition from earl
y smoking to nicotine dependence (ND) in adolescents is not fully  
understood, but similar to adults, intensity  and frequency  of cigarette use is associated with 
ND.[ADDRESS_1258004] studies of smoking cessation in adolescents defined their target patient population 
by [CONTACT_2236] , frequency  and in some cases, duration of cigarette smoking, in an attempt to 
identify  adolescents who were nicotine dependent
.The Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire 
(FTQ) was modified and validated for use in adolescents age 12 -16.6The validation of the 
FTQ with salivary  cotinine in adolescents showed good performance for all questions except 
for “Do you inhale”. As this q uestion did not perform well in either 
adults or adolescents ,
the authors recommended abbreviating the scale to six questions.  The sesix questions are the 
same as the six items included in the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) 
(Appendix 2) which will be used in this study  as an instrument to identify  adolescents likely  
to be nicotine
-dependent. 
This study  will examine whether varenicline, in conjunction with age-appropriate smoking 
cessation counse ling at each clinic visit and telephone contact [CONTACT_897504][INVESTIGATOR_897488] 
5 cigarettes per day , to stop smoking.  
Primary Objective :
To evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of varenicline compared w ith placebo 
in adolescent tobacco smokers (aged 12-19 years) .

Page 7Endpoints
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:
The 4 -week continuous quit rate (CQR) from Week 9 through Week 12 of treatment 
for varenicline compared with placebo.
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints: 
7-day point -prevalence of smoking abstinence at Weeks 12 , 24, and 52;
R
eduction in number of cigarettes smoked at Weeks 12, 24, and 52;
C
ontinuous abstinence rate from Week 9 through Week 24;
Continuous abstinence rate from Week 9 through Week 52
.
Safety  Assessments: 
Adverse events spontaneously  volunteered or observed, adverse events elicited by  [CONTACT_897505] (NAEI) (Appendix 4), Columbia Suicide 
Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] A nxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) , 
and adverse events associated with safet y laboratory  tests, or vital signs.
PK Assessments: 
Varenicline exposure at steady -state in adolescent smokers.
Statistical Method s
The primary  anal ysis population will be all sub jects who took at least one dose of 
randomized study  medication.  All significance tests will be two- sided and will use a 
0.[ADDRESS_1258005] smoking status evaluation.
For the binary  endpoints with planned inferential treatment comparisons, a logistic regression 
model will be fitted w hich will include the main effects of strata, treatment group and center 
as independent variables.  Treatment b y center interaction will be investigated by [CONTACT_897506]; however the reported p -
values will be based on the main effects model.  
Analy sis of the change from baseline in mean number of cigarettes smoked per day  will use 
analysis of covariance with baseline value, strata, treatment group and center included in the 
model.  The assumptions of the linear model will be examined and if not satisfie d, 
nonparametric methods will be used.  There will be no formal inferential analyses of safet y 
assessments.  The standard and additional safety  data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_683518].

at equivalent dail y doses in adult smokers (NDA 21 -928, 09 November 2005, Sequence 
# 0000, Module 2.7.221, 22(see references to pop P K in adults ). Adolescents from the Low 
Body Weight group ( 55 kg) tended to have greater varenicline exposures compared to the

High Bod y Weight group, adolescents of smaller body  size exhibited exposures within the 
range of exposures observed in heavier adolescents and in adults. Consistent with the

Dose Selection Rationale
Varenicline doses for this study  were selected based on the safety , tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics, and effi cacy information from the clinical trials in adult smokers and the 
pharmacokineti c and tolerability  data from the single -dose (A305102923) and the

Page 18In clinical trials in adult smokers, both varenicline 1 mg BID and 0.5 mg BID regimens 
demonstrated efficacy  as an aid to smoking cessation, and exposure-response information 
further indicated that higher s ystemic exposure to varenicline was associated with greater 
probability  of 4-week smoking cessation. This study  proposes to investigate both 1 mg BID 
and 0.5 mg BID doses compared with p lacebo in the adolescent population.  
Since Study  A3051070 demonstrated that varenicline exposure was adequately  adjusted b y 
halving the total dail y dose of varenicline in subjects at or below the pre -specified weight 
threshold of 55 kg, adolescent subjec ts 55kg will have their randomized dose reduced b y 
half in this study . Those randomized to 1 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg BID and those 
randomized to 0.5 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg QD.  This dosing scheme should provide an 
adequate range of individual exp osures to investigate the exposure -response relationships for 
selected measures of efficacy  and tolerability .  All dosing regimens other than 0.5 mg QD 
will begin with a two week titration period followed by  10 weeks at the target dose. 
Smoking Cessation Counseling Program
Smoking cessation attempts are more likel y to be successful with counseling and support.  
All subjects will receive brief age-
appropriate smoking cessation counseling in accordance 
with the Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines24at each clinic visit and telephone contact, 
starting with the baseline visit. 
2.STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
2.1.Primary Objective

3.STUDY DESIGN
This will be a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study  to compare 
two doses of varenicline 1 mg BID and 0.5 mg BID with placebo for smoking cessation in 
adolescent smokers aged 12-19 years who are motivated to quit. Since varenicline exposure 
is related to bod y weight, subjects w ith a body  weight [ADDRESS_1258020] their varenicline dose 
reduced b y half (those randomized to 1 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg BID and those 
randomized to 0.5 mg BID will receive 0.5 mg QD).  
All subjects and their parents/legal guardians will provide inform ed consent/assent before 
any study  activities occur.  
Subjects over the age of 18 may  sign their own informed consent. 
(Parents, guardians, or caregivers need to be actively  involved in the assessment and 
monitoring of these patients). Subject eligibilit y will be reviewed during a t hree week 
screening period.
Those subjects deemed eligible will be randomized and enter the 12 -week placebo- controlled 
treatment period with weekly  clinic visits for efficacy  and safet
y assessments and smoking 
cessation counsel ing. Varenicline or placebo dosing will begin with two weeks of titration.
(Figure 1). All subjects will set a target quit date (TQD) to coincide with the Week [ADDRESS_1258021] week of the treatment phase.  A visit window 
of 3 day s can be allowed to accommodate unforeseen scheduling issues.  Brief 
a
ge-appropriate smoking cessation counselin g, in accordance with Public Health Service 
(PHS) guidelines, up to [ADDRESS_1258022] 4 weeks of the 
12week dosing period.  
Follow -up (non -treatment) period: 
The primary  purpose of the non- treatment follow -up study  phase is to assess the long -term 
smoking abstinence. In addition, during this phase, subjects will be monitored for an y 
neurops ychiatric or suicide -related adverse events. 
Subjects will be followed to obtain smoking status for 9 months after the end of the 12-week 
treatment 
period.  Clinic visits will occur at Weeks 13-16 ( inclusive ), 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52. 
Telephone contacts are planned for weeks 24, 3 2, 40, and 48.  To accommodate unforeseen

Page 20circumstances, a visit window of 3 day s can be allowed for week 13 through 20 visits, and a 
visit window of 5 day s can be allowed for week 20 to week 52 visits.  
Smoking -
cessation counseling up to 10 minutes dur ation will be provided at each clinic visit 
and telephone contac t for the duration of the study. Whenever possible, counseling should be 
conducted b y the same counselor throughout, so that the relationship builds and brings 
additional value to the sessions. 
Subjects that stop taking study  drug during the treatment phase (wks 1-12) are still eligible to 
remain in the study , provided they  continue to comply  with remaining visit procedures. All 
efforts should be made to keep the subjects in the study .If an earl y termination of the study  
occurs, the appropriate ET visit should be completed in accordance with the schedule of 
activities

5.4.Formulation and Packaging
Varenicline will be supplied as 0.5 mg tablets of the I mmediate Release formulation.  Tablets 
(blinded varenicline or placebo) will be supplied in blister packs con taining sufficient tablets 
for 10 day s.  A new blister pack will be dispensed after each weekl y clinic visit to provide 
sufficient study  drug until the next scheduled clinic visit. 
5.5.Preparation and Dispensing
Study  drug is to be dispensed to subjects by  [CONTACT_897508] (or after) each 
scheduled clinic visit from the Baseline visit to the Week 11 visit (according to the stud y 
flowchart).  Site personnel should provide instructions for study  drug dosing to each subject, 
and request that the subject read for understanding. Once reading is complete, the subject 
will be asked to initial and date the instructions indicating they  comprehend the meaning of 
the sun (am) and moon (pm) and other aspects of the dosing card instructions. If the child is 
aminor, the parent should date and sign to indicate their understanding as well. The 
discussion should be documented in source as well .Subjects will receive their first blister 
pack at (or after) the Baseline visit and will receive a new blister pack at (or after) each 
weekl y clinic visit through the Week [ADDRESS_1258034] being the
morni ng after the Baseline visit day .  The blister cards are set up in 2 columns; sun, (am), and 
moon, (pm) to accommodate BID dosing schedule. Each subject will be instructed to take 
two pi[INVESTIGATOR_897493] (in the direction 
of the arrow printed on the card). It is i mportant that this order is followed. The blister cards 
have been created such that dosing instructions (2 tablets in the morning, 2 tablets in the 
evening) remain the same throughout the study . After the subjects are instructed on proper 
dosing, the sub jects should repeat these directions, and initial and date to document 
comprehension of these instructions. If subject is a minor, the parent should initial and date 
as well. 
Dosing should occur with a full glass (240 ml) of water and it is recommended t hat subjects 
eat prior to dosing.  At least [ADDRESS_1258035] ,or at a strength of 4 mg/day or higher.  Such medication 
errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the adverse event (AE) page of 
the CRF and on the SAE form when appropriate.   In the event of medication dosing error 
(4mg/day  or higher) the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whet her or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error and, if applicable, an y associated adverse event (s) is

5.7.Dosing Compliance
Subjects will return blister packs at (or after) each visit.  A dosing record and drug 
accountability  form will be completed.  Reasons for missed doses should be ascertained and
patterns of missed doses should be discussed in detail.  Subjects may beconsidered non -
compliant if weekl y compliance is less than 80%. 
5.8. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all study  
drug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions and in accordance 
with applicable regulatory  requirements.  Varenicline and matching placebo should be stored 
at 15-30C or 59-86F as indicated on the label.
To ensure adequate records, all study  drug will be accounted for in the case report form and

the [COMPANY_007] medical monitor (or designated representative) should be notified and the 
follow -up evaluations will be performed until the abnormalities return to the normal/baseline 
condition.  The investigator should make every  effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at
appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalities.
6.4.Early Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Subjects who wish to withdraw from the study  will be allowed to do so at any  time without 
prejudice, or they  may  be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or 
sponsor for safety or behavioral, or the inability of the subject to compl y with the protocol 
required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study  site. Subjects should be 
discontinued if they  cannot be co ntacted for drug monitoring or do not return for s ubsequent 
scheduled visit s.The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the 
subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request the subject return for a final 
visit, if applicable and follow- up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse events 
(AEs). Diligent attempts will be made by  [CONTACT_897515] -up as this may  be related to the study  drug.
Early permanent withdrawal of study drug use may occur at an y phase of the study.  Possible 
reasons for early  permanent withdrawal of study  drug use include:

Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 34Adverse event: The subject develops an adverse event, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_897498], institutional principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigator 
warrants termination of study  drug use.
Personal reason: A subject may  withdraw from study  drug use at an y time.
Pregnancy .
In the event of stud y treatment discontinuation, subjects should be encouraged to continue to 
attend clinic and telephone visits, and complete study  procedures.
The investigator must determine the primary  reason for withdrawal of study drug and record 
it on the case report form.  Withdrawal of study drug due to an adverse event should be 
distinguished from withdrawal of study  drug 
due to insufficient response.  A treatment or 
study  discontinuation due to a serious adverse event must be reported to [COMPANY_007] immediately .  
Return to smoking is not a basi
s for withdrawing a subject from the study .  Subjects who 
return to smoking should be encouraged to make further quit attempts and to continue their 
participation with the counseling and protocol -specified visits and procedures.
Female subjects who have a positive pregnancy  test during the treatment period will 
discontinue study  medication but should continue study participation.  Pregnant subjects 
must be followed to the outcome of the pregnancy  and an Exposure in Utero Form (EIU) 
must be submitted.  
Any subjects who discontinue treatment for any  reason may  continue participation in the 
study  and should be encouraged to do so.  They  will be required to maintain the visit 
schedule and can continue participation through the non
-treatment follow -up phase of t he 
study .
Subjects should be encouraged to complete the study even if they  stop study  medication .If 
the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
I
n post marketing safet y surveillance t here have been some reports of depressed mood, 
agitation, changes in behavior ,psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal 
ideation, hostility , anxiety , panic, and suicidal ideation (suicidal thoughts) and suicide in 
patients attempting to quit smoking while taking varenicline.  Because these events are 
reported voluntaril y from a population of uncertain size, it is not alway s possible to reliably  
estimate their frequency  or establish causal relationship to drug exposure.  The role of 
varenicline in these reports is not known. A subject who experiences such events s hould stop 
dosing and imme diatel y report an y such s ymptoms to the study  staff . 
Each clinical research site will have an Emergency Response Plan in place to properly 
care for subjects who report events of a serious nature that require immediate or very 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 35prompt att ention.  This plan will include having a pediatric/adolescent psychiatrist 
available at all times .  
At all clinic visits, the investigator will be proactively  monitoring for anxiety , panic, 
hostility , aggression, abnormal thinking, hallucinations, suicida lity and depressed mood 
through the use of the C -SSRS, HADS (Appendix 3), and the NAE I(Appendix 4). These 
evaluations should be conducted by  [CONTACT_897516]. A subject must be 
discontinued from study  medication and referred for appropriate medical or psy chiatric 
evaluation and follow -up if there is:  
Apositive response 
to any question onthe C -SSRS ;
Ascore 15 for anxiety  or >15 for depression on the HADS (Appendix 3);
Moderate or severe adverse event 
as elicited through the use of the Neuropsy chiatric 
Adverse Event Interview .
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request , or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behavioural, 
or administrative reasons.  If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort 
should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]. In an y circumstance, every  effort should be made to 
document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request the 
subject return for a final v isit, if applicable, and follow -up with the subject regarding an y 
unresolved adverse events. 
7.ASSESSMENTS
7.1.Efficacy
7.1.1. Smoking Status
Smoking status will be assessed using a standard series of questions referred to as the 
Nicotine Use Inventory  (NUI) (Appendix 1).  The subject responds Yes or No to questions 
about cigarette or other nicotine/tobacco use since the last visit or during the past 7 days
.
The NUI is completed at each clinic vi sit and/or phone contact [CONTACT_897517] -up period by  [CONTACT_897518]’ responses. 
All subjects will be provided with Smoking Diary  Worksheets to use as a tool to record how 
many  cigarettes they  have smoked each day .The Smoking Diary  itself will not be 
data-based.
7.1.2. Urine Cotinine Testing
In order to confirm the self-reported abstinence from smoking urine cotinine testing will be 
done at the site at Weeks 9- [ADDRESS_1258043] indicates a positive result when the cotinine in the urine exceeds 
200ng/mL.
7.1.3. Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence
The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence provides a short, self -reported measure of 
dependency  on nicotine. This test will be com pleted at screening onl y.The test’s questions 
and scale are shown in (Appendix 2). This should be scored and reviewed by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_897499]. 
7.2.Safety
7.2.1. Laboratory
The following safet y laboratory  tests will be performed at protocol- specified time points 
(details

7.2.2. Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded after subjects have rested in a sitting position 
for approximately  [ADDRESS_1258044]’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  The 
same arm (preferabl y the dominant arm) will be used throughout the trial.   In addition to 
these first measurements, blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded after subjects have 
been supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044]  5minutes, and then orthostatic blood press ure will 
immediately  be recorded when t he subject is asked to stand.  The pulse should also be 
recorded at the times that the BP is recorded.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properl y sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pre ssure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure and pulse rate are acceptable, although, when done manuall y, pulse rate will be 
measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least [ADDRESS_1258045] suicidal 
behavior,15will be completed b y subjects at the Screening visit.
7.2.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)
The Columbia suicide Severity  Rating Scale (CSSRS)16is a set of suggested questions 
designed to elicit information about passive and active suicidal ideation, active suicidal 
intent, and self injurious behavior.
The C -SSRS will be completed by  a mental health professional (adolesc ent psy chiatrist or 
PhD psy chologist )
, at screening and at each subsequent clinic visit up to and including 
Week 52. 
7.2.6.
Actively Solicited Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events (Appendix 4)
The NAEI will be conducted at every  clinic visit from baseline through Week 52.  The 
Neurops ychiatric Adverse Event Interview (NAEI) must be conducted b y a qualified mental 
health professional, who will actively  inquire about the following t ype of adverse events: 
depression, anxiety , delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, ps ychosis, mania, panic, agitation, 
dissociative states, feeling abnormal, hostility , aggression and homicidal ideation. If a 
subject has a positive response to an y item on the 
NAEI , a determination will be made by  [CONTACT_897521]. If it does meet criteria as 
an adverse event it will be recorded on the adverse event pages of the Case Report Form.  
Dosing must be stopped if an adverse event moderate or severe in na ture is elicited through 
thisinterview. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74017] (HADS) (Appendix 3).
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74017] (HADS) measures anxiety  and depression in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_897500].17  It is a patient completed questionnair e that establishes the presence and 
severit y of both anxiety  (7 questions) and depression (7 qu estions) ( Appendix 3).  
The HADS is a self -report scale and contains [ADDRESS_1258046] be stopped if the HADS score for either 
depression or anxiey  is 15.
Subjects’ self -
report via the HADS is aimed to more full y characterize potential depression 
and anxiety  related events. These additional mea surements will be collected and evaluated in 
a different manner than the observed or volunteered adverse events.  No attempt will be made 
to resolve an y apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse events and 
the additional data collected from subjects using the HADS self -report.  These additional data 
will be presented in separate tables, separate figures, and separate data listings, and will be 
reviewed in the final study report.

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 39Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from the self -reported HADS data but 
rather from the spontaneously  reported information, the NAEI and the CSSRS data described 
above, recorded on the adverse event pages from the Case Report Form (CRF).
7.3.Pharmacokinetics (PK)
7.3.1. Plasma for Analysis of Varenicline:
Blood samples (3 mL) sufficient to provide a minimum of 1 mL  of plasma for 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be collected at protocol specified time -points ( see Table 1
Schedule of Activities) into appropriatel y labeled tubes contain ing sodium heparin. These 
PK samples should not all be collected at the same time after dosing.  A distribution of 
sampling should be encouraged, possibl y through randomly scheduling sampling throughout 
the visit day .  The times of study  drug dosing for t he prior 2 doses as well as the time of the 
blood drawing will be recorded at each of these visits on the source document and data 
collection tool (eg, CRF) . 
The samples should be cooled on ice or in a refrigerator at -2- 8°C (this procedure is meant to 
mi
nimize hemoly sis and mazimize plasma y ield from the whole blood), then centrifuged for 
about 10 minutes at 1400-1700 x g. Plasma is to be transferred to appropriately  labeled 
screw -capped pol yprop ylene tubes provided b y the Central Laboratory .The tubes with 
plasma samples should then be stored at -20°C within one hour of blood collection. Samples 
will be anal yzed using a validated anal ytical method in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard 
operating procedures.
7.3.2. Shipment of PK Samples
The shipment address and c ontact information will be provided to the investigator site prior 
to initiation of the trial.
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to t ime there may be 
circumstances, outside the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to perform 
the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety  and 
well-being of the subject.  When a protocol req uired test cannot be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventative actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. 
The study  team will be informed of the se incidents in a timely  fashion.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
The adolescent subjects will be instructed to tell the study  doctor immediately  if they  
experience an y side effects, injury , symptoms or complaints.  They  will be provided a 
[ADDRESS_1258047](s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections.
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notifica tion to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained 
by [CONTACT_292107].  The investigator is 
required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_547590] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs 
with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y review conducted b y the Sponsor, any non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE.  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
trial.
8.2.Reporting Period
For serious adverse events,
(SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the subje ct’s participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing an y 
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through the last subject 
visit. Should an investigator be made aware of a ny serious adverse event occurring any  time 
after the active reporting period, it must be promptly  reported if a causal relationship to 
investigational product is suspected. 
Adverse events (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the 
time the subject /legal guardian provides informed conse nt/assent through last subject 
visit.   
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal 
relationsh ip with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 41Progression/worsening of underl yingdisease ;
Drug abuse ;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose ;
Drug withdrawal ;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (in Utero );
Exposure via breast feeding ;
Medication error .
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additi onal diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y, and/or
Test result is considered to be a n adverse event by  [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting a s an adverse event.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any  untoward medical occurrence 
at an y dose that:

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 42Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect ;
Lack of efficacy  should be reported a s an adverse event when it is associated with a 
serious adverse event.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  
life-threatening an d/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the 
event may  jeopardize the subject and/or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other 
adverse event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.Potential Cases of Drug- Induc ed Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bili rubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered pot ential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important medical 
events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory
 values:
a.Subjects with AST or ALT baseline values within the normal range who subsequently  
present with AST or ALT 3 times the upper limit of normal concurrent with a total 
bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal with no evidence of hemol ysis and an 
alkaline phosphatase 2 times the upper limit of norma l or not available.
For subjects with preexisti ng ALT ORAST ORtotal bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 43For subjects with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline valu es above the normal 
range: AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  [ADDRESS_1258048], or 
[ADDRESS_1258049] (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with: 
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased by  [CONTACT_292110]  3times the 
upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_1258050] bilirubin, GGT, prothrombin time/ internat ional normalized ratio (INR) and 
alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of 
ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , 
occupational exposure, sexual history , trave l history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced 
subject, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, 
should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract ) may  be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the 
laboratory criteria defined above with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the 
time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all t he 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such 
potential Hy ’s Law cases should be reported as serious adverse events.
8.7.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_897501].  An y initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility  meets these criteria.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292088]/intensive care unit (eg, from the ps ychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor 
to a coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 44Routine emergency  room admissions;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
adverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition 
(eg, for work -up of persistent pre -treatment lab abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_43038] y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associ ated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (eg, for 
elective cosmetic surgery);
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE ;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event.  
For purposes of consiste ncy, these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinc tion between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event (SAE) .  For example, a headache may  be severe 
(interferes significantl y with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as seri ous 
unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non- serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 45requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event ; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided .  If the investigator does not know whether or not the 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see Section on 
Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality  assessmen t is "unknown but not 
related to investigational product", this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study  
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure D uring Pregnancy ( Also Referred to as Exposure In Utero )
For investi gational products and for marketed products, an exposure in -utero (EIU) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly  exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the 
fema le becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly  
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure);
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to the 
investigational product prior to or arou nd the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy  (paternal exposure).
If any stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the in vestigator must submit this 
information to [COMPANY_007] on an Exposure in Utero Form.  I n addition, the investigator must 
submit information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant 
woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product 
by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the Exposure in Utero Form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy .  
The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to induced termination of pregnancy ).If at an y time a study  subject 
becomes or is found to be pregnant and a pregnancy  registry  is ongoing, the subject will be 
enrolled in the p regnancy registry . 
Follow -upis conducted to obtain pregnancy  outcome information on all Exposure in Utero 
reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination ( ie, induced abortion) and then notify  [COMPANY_007] of the 
outcome.  The investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Exposure 
in Utero Form.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An EIU report is 
not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy  is not usuall y 
viable.  Rather, a serious adverse event case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy .

CP-526,555
A3051073
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 09 July 2012
Page 46If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious 
adverse event (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly  
[including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should 
follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.
In the case of a live bir th, the “normality ” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth 
(ie, no minimum follow -up period of a presumably  normal infant is required before an 
Exposure in Utero Form can be completed).  The “normality ” of an aborted fetus can be 
assessed b y gross visual inspection, unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a 
congenital anomal y.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are classified as serious adverse 
events follows: 
“Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1258051] to causalit y, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after 
1month that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the exposure in utero to 
the investigational medication should be reported.
Additional information regarding the exposure in utero may  be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  
Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up 
on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator must obtain permission from the subject’s partner in order to conduct any  
follow -up or collect an y information.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient 
response, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page.  
When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse e vent, the serious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  report ed by  [CONTACT_232304].  In addition, each study  subject will be 
questioned about adverse events.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
events.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.

CP-526,[ADDRESS_1258052] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent 
of available adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new 
information (follow -up) on previously  forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to 
the initial and follow -up reporting of Exposure in Utero and exposure via breastfeeding 
cases.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the o ccurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to [COMPANY_007] in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may  be requested by  [CONTACT_897522] -up information in 
an expedited fashion.  This information may  be more detailed than that captured on the 
adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a description of the adverse 
event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and 
independent determination of possible causalit y.  Information on other possible causes of the 
event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a 
subject death, a summa ry of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be 
noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the 
adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a 
consistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be us ed on both forms.  
Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as 
on the form for collection of serious adverse event information.
8.13.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) and the Statistical Rulebook, 
which will be dated and maintained by [CONTACT_456], before the time of database release.  The 
reasons for an y departure from the planned method of anal ysis will be fully documented.

CP-526,[ADDRESS_1258053] with a 0.05 significance level and a 
1:1:1 randomization ratio of vareniclin e 1 mg BID to varenicline 0.5 mg BID to placebo.  
The study  is powered at 80% or greater to detect varenicline (1 mg BID or 0.5 mg BID dose) 
vs. placebo differences in the CQR from Weeks 9 through 12 . The sample size is based on 
CQR of 9% and 24 % for plac ebo and varenicline respectivel y, or an odds ratio of 3.2.  
A sample size of 300 subjects randomized to varenicline or placebo in a 1:1:1 (100 to 
varenicline 1 mg BID, 100 to varenicline 0.5 mg BID, 
100 to placebo) will provide 
approximately 80% power to detect a difference in the primary  endpoint between varenicline 
and placebo groups, assuming a true Week 9 -12 CQR of 9% and 24% for placebo and 
varenicline respectively .  
Enrollment will be stratified by  [CONTACT_551] (12
-16 vs. 17 -19) and sufficient subjects will be 
enrolled in the [ADDRESS_1258054] a difference in the primary  endpoint 
between varenicline and placebo groups, assuming a true Week 9 -12 CQR of 9% and 
29%for placebo and varenicline respectivel y. 
In order to ensure sufficient subjects are enrolled in the 12- [ADDRESS_1258055] 
210subjects (approximately  70 subjects per treatment group) in the [ADDRESS_1258056] 1 dose of 
randomized study  medication ( Full A nalysis set ).  Subjects who discontinue the study  are 
assumed to be smokers for the time point of discontinuation through the end of t he study .  In 
computing responder rates, subjects who discontinue the study  will be included in the 
denominator but not in the numerator, regardless of their last smoking status evaluation. 
9.1.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Endpoints
There are seve ral secondary  smoking abstinence endpoints for this study , as indicated in 
Section 2.2.  Each of these binary  secondary  endpoints will be analy zed using procedures 
similar to that described above for the primary  efficacy  endpoi nt.  All statistical tests will be 
two-sided and at a 0.[ADDRESS_1258057] of treatment on the 
reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The plasma concentration- time data collected in this study  will be anal yzed via nonlinear 
mixed effects (NONMEM software) to describe the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
varenicline including an assessment of covaria te effects in adolescent smokers. 
Varenicline exposure data derived from the individual Bay esian estimates of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be subsequentl y utilized to characterize the population 
exposure -response relationships for selected measures of efficacy  and safety /tolerability  of 
varenicline in this pediatric population. Model development may  require the use of data 
from previous clinical studies. An anal ysis plan describing the details of the model building, 
covariate assessment and model validation will be provided separatel y before the unblinding 
of the data.
9.2.Safety Analysis
All safet y anal yses will be performed overall as well as on the subgroup of patients who are 
12-16 years of age.   Laboratory and other safety  data will be subjected t o clinical review and 
summarized, using [COMPANY_007] Data Standards, b y frequencies of events and mean changes from 
Baseline.  
The following summaries will be used to assess the safet y of subjects in this study :
Incidence and t ype of AEs ;
Incidence and t ype o f SAEs ;  
Change from ba seline in laboratory  parameters;  
Incidence of clinicall y significant laboratory  parameters ;  
Change from baseline in vital signs ;  
Incidence of clinicall y significant vital sign parameters ;  
Frequency  and percent of subjects en dorsing suicidal ideation or behavior.
All safet y anal yses will use the population of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_1258058] anned .
9.4.Data Monitoring Committee 
Anexternal Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to review 
data during the course of the study  for safety  monitoring and assessing risk benefit.  Based on 
their review the IDMC will make a recom mendation to continue, modify  or stop the study .  
The IDMC members will be selected from a pool of experts including one statistician, a 
psychiatrist and an expert in pediatric studies.  The IDMC will meet before study  start to 
discuss and finalize the charter.
The frequency  of meetings will be dependent upon subject enrollment.  It is suggested that 
the first data review will take place after [ADDRESS_1258059] in increments of 50 subjects completing the 
12
week treatment period, and as subjects complete the 9 month follow -up period; or at a 
minimum of two times a year. Serious adverse event (SAE) reports will be provided to the 
IDMC on a real -time basis. The frequency  of meetings will be adjusted b y the IDMC chair 
as she/he considers appropriate to fulfill the
IDMC's responsibilities.
Details will be outlined in the IDMC charter.
The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects in 
the study  accor ding to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  [CONTACT_897523].  [COMPANY_007] will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  In this instance, 
such disease -related efficacy  endpoints are not reported individually  as SAEs. 
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During stud y conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) , and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or 
companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_36550].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available duri ng the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

CP-526,[ADDRESS_1258060] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole proper ty of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any  form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the accuracy , authenticit y, and timely 
collection and reporting of all clinical, safety , laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and an y 
other data collection forms. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or by  [CONTACT_897524] d ata contained on the CRFs is true. Any 
corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and 
explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry .” 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or t he phy sician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the invest igator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to I CH, local regulation s, or as specified in the Clinical 
Study  Agreement, whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  T he 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent part y arranged b y [COMPANY_007].  Investigator 
records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1258061] obtain 
[COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements 
have been met.

CP-526,[ADDRESS_1258062] ( IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicabl e, from the I RB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducte d in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2008). 
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws . Subject names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be 
replaced b y a numerical code consisting of a numberi ng system provided by  [CONTACT_897525] -identify  the trial subject. In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of 
confidentiality  and protection of subject personal data.
The informed consent form must be in compliance with I CH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements.
The informed consent form used in this study , and any  changes made during the course of the 
study , must be prospectively  approved b y both the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] before use.
The investigator must ensur e that each study  subject, or his/her legally  acceptable 
representative, is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation.  The investigator, or a person designated by  [CONTACT_1275], will ob tain written informed consent from each subject or the subject's legally  
acceptable representative before an y stud y-specific activity  is performed.  Direct assent of 
the adolescent subject must also be obtained.  Parental consent is not required for subjec ts 
over the age of 18.  These subjects must sign their own informed consent document.  The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent / assent form.

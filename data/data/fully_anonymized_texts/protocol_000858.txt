Comparison of time to full recovery of muscle paralysis (TOF>0.9) and 
extubation using Sugammadex versus Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate in 
patients with pulmonary disease in the outpatient Bronchoscopy Suite  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_253908] Revi sion: 19-May-2023  1) Abstract of the study  
Patients who have chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) are known to 
experience more postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) such as re -
intubation, COPD or ILD exacerbation, pulmo nary infection and even 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_212023]. Studies have suggested 
that respi[INVESTIGATOR_212024] a contributing factor to such 
complications. These patients often require  outpatient bronchoscopic 
procedures such  as lung biopsies , tracheal and bronchial dilations, and 
bronchoalveolar lavage . These procedures are conducted either under 
conscious sedation, or general anesthesia. Our study will focus on lung 
patients in the bronchoscopy suite undergoing procedure s requiring general 
anesthesia. Due to these patients ’ health  status, it is important to ensure 
appropriate neuromuscular reversal and extubation time. We propose the 
following hypothes es to improve the efficiency of patient care in the 
bronchoscopy suite. If Sugammadex is used to reverse neuromuscular 
blockade after outpatient bronchoscopy in patients with COPD or ILD, they 
will recover from the neuromuscular blockade completely  and more efficiently 
(faster) than if neostigmine and glycopyrrolate are given for  the same 
purpose.  In addition, i f Sugammadex is used to reverse neuromuscular 
blockade after outpatient bronchoscopy in patients with COPD or ILD, they 
will be extubated sooner than if neostigmine and glycopyrrolate are given for 
the same purpose. Finall y, if Sugammadex is used to reverse neuromuscular 
blockade after outpatient bronchoscopy in patients with COPD or ILD, these 
patients will be discharged from the bronchoscopy suite sooner than if 
neostigmine and glycopyrrolate are given for the same purpos e. The latter 
two hypotheses are secondary to the first listed hypothesis.

6) Objectives  
The objective of this study is to compare time to full reversal of 
neuromuscular blocka de between use of Sugammadex or 
neostigmine/glycopyrrolate as determined by [CONTACT_212038] >0.9 in patients with 
pulmonary disease  in the outpatient bronchoscopy suite. A secondary 
outcome measured will be time to extubation.  
 
7) Background  
Patients with COPD and ILD are more likely to have PPC. Severity of their 
disease and length of the operative procedure both correlate with an increase 
in these complications [1-5]. This patient population has also been shown to 
develop progressive atrophy of their respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458]: thoracic accessory 
muscles in those with COPD and the diaphragm in those with ILD [6,7].  
Studies have shown that pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce dyspnea and 
improve pulmonary fu nction [8], suggesting that respi[INVESTIGATOR_212025] 
a possible factor contributing to adverse events.  In support of this hypothesis, 
one study looking at ASA [ADDRESS_253911] a PPC [9].  It is  these 
chronic lung disease  patients that come to the bronchoscopy suite for 
outpatient procedures, commonly lung biopsies. While some bronchoscopic  
procedures are performed under conscious sedation (no anesthesiologist, 
midazolam and fentanyl only), many others require general anesthesia with 
endotracheal intubation and neuromuscular blockade.  Given these patients’ 
compromised respi[INVESTIGATOR_212026], it is logical that full and timely 
reversal of neuromuscular blockade is essential to the prompt recovery of 
these patients after bronchoscopy.   
In addition to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_212027], 
reliable timely extubation i s essential to the efficiency of the bronchoscopy 
suite.  These cases run for highly variable periods of time (20 minutes to 2 
hours) and the neuromuscular blockade should be reversed in an efficient 
manner. Given the need for general anesthesia with neuro muscular blockade 
and the unpredictability of the duration of the bronchoscopic procedure, there

completeness of such reversal .  Completeness of reversal will be measured 
using the TwitchView monitor, an electromyography  (EMG) -based device to 
detect muscle twitch strength aft er delivery of  electrical stimulus. Patients will 
be randomized to receive one reversal treatment or the other, and the time to 
full revers al of neuromuscular blockade as well as the time to extubation will 
be followed.   
7) Setting of the Human Research  
This study will be conducted in the bronchoscopy suite  at Temple University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Philadelphia  PA. The potential subjects will be recrui ted during their 
preoperative anesthetic examination in PAT. All investigators and research

11) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
 
This research study will have the design of a blinded randomized clinical trial.  
The pharmacist will not be blinded to the stud y medication given.  The 
anesthesia provider cannot be blinded because he/she will need to determine 
the proper dose and timing of the neuromuscular blocker reversal medication 
(the study medications) given at the end of the pro cedure. The study will 
recru it 80 patients coming to Temple University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212029].  Rocuronium will be the neuromuscular blockade 
medication given in this study. Inclusion crite ria for these patients will include 
those age >[ADDRESS_253916] a diagnosis of COPD and/or ILD and who require 
medical treatment for the same. Patients who belong to a vulnerable 
population will be excluded (pregnant women, prisoners, patients with 
dementia or otherwise not able to consent themselves).  Requiring medical 
treatment for these conditions will place the patients in the ASA 3 or ASA 4 
health status category based on their pulmonary disease.  The patients will 
then be randomly assigned to one of two s tudy arms ( 40 per arm).  Patients in 
one arm of the study will receive Sugammadex and patients in the other arm

patients with pulmonary disease in the outpatient Bronchoscopy Suite  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_253917] Revi sion: 19-May-2023  will receive neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for reversal of neuromuscular 
blockade.   Due to the nature of bronchoscopy for biopsy, the depth of 
anesthesia at the end of the case will be difficult to predict; the length of the 
cases may vary some (although most will be approximately one hour),  and 
patients’ metabolism of neuromuscular blocking agents is very much 
dependent on their personal medicatio n regimens and liver function.  We plan 
to follow each patient’s depth of neuromuscular blockade using the 
TwitchView monitor, a commercially available, EMG -based monitor.  The 
TwitchView measures muscle response to delivered electrical stimuli  (2Hz)  
which are sent in sets of 4 0.5 seconds apart (most commonly). The muscles 
controlled by [CONTACT_212039], and will be during 
this study. These set of  electrical stimuli are called a train of four.  Return of 
muscle strength after  reversal agents are given is considered complete when 
the ratio of the stren gth of the response to the fourth  electrical stimulus to the 
first stimulus is 0.9.  The device can also deliver one long electrical stimulus of 
[ADDRESS_253918] 
weaker muscle strength response. This only occurs if recovery f rom 
neuromuscular blockade has begun. Multiple time points will be recorded, 
including train of four measurement (TOF) every 5 minutes during the 
procedure, time and TOF at the end of the procedure, time of reversal 
medication dosing, time of TOF>0.9 and t ime of extubation.   The TwitchView 
monitor will deliver a train of four stimulus to the patient every 5 minutes 
during the procedure until full reversal of neuromuscular blockade is detected. 
Reversal medication will be given as soon as each patient’s pro cedure is 
complete and the patient meets appropriate criteria for reversal for each 
respective medication.   This means that upon completion of the procedure, 
patients in the Sugammadex arm will be reversible from the point of [ADDRESS_253919] 
tetanic muscle twitc hes or better.  Depending on the results from the 
TwitchView monitor, the dose of Sugammadex given will be appropriate for 
the finding of deep (4mg /kg) or moderate block(2mg/kg).   Those in the 
Neostigmine/glycopyrrolate arm will be reversible from the tim e of detection of 
1-2 twitches. Comparison of the data from the two arms of the study will then 
be made.  
Adverse events will be reported using the adverse event reporting document 
attached.  Adverse events will also be subjected to statistical analysis as

Determination of deep vs moderate blockade:  
In order to provide neuromuscular blocking reversal medications at the proper time and 
dose, the de gree of neuromuscular blockade for each patient must be monitored.  The 
monitor we will use is called the TwitchView monitor.  It will be attached by [CONTACT_212040]/thumb of the patient, and every 5 minutes small electrical stimuli will be given 
through the device and the muscle responses or twitches measured by [CONTACT_8121].  The 
electrical stimuli are given as four impulses of 50 Hz, 100milliseconds apart.  This set of 
stimuli is called the train of four. The depth of the neuromuscular blockade is mea sured 
by [CONTACT_212041]’s muscles have to these stimuli (1,2 ,3 or 4) and how 
strong the 4th twitch is compared to the 1st twitch. A moderate level of neuromuscular 
blockade is defined by [CONTACT_212042] (no ratio needed here). If the 
TwitchView does not register any muscle response to the stimuli, it sends a single 100Hz 
stimulus followed by [CONTACT_212043].  A deep neuromuscular blockade 
is defined as at most [ADDRESS_253921] 
twitch to the 4th twitch.  
 
Treatment:  
Medication dosing for each arm of the study will be as follows:  
 
Sugammadex arm:  4mg/kg for deep block or 2mg/kg for moderate block given 
intravenously once procedure is complete and reversal criteria are met.  
 
Neostigmine/glycopyrrolate arm: 0.05mg/kg neostigmine up to a maximum dose 
of 5mg and 0.6mg glycopyrrolate once procedure is complete and reversal 
criteria are met.  
 
Study Limitations:  
Limitations of this study are that it will be performed in a single ac ademic medical 
center (not a multi -center study) and that our population is an inner city, lower 
socioeconomic population and results may not be fully generalizable to other 
populations. In addition, we will be limiting our study to a narrow range of 
proce dures often done in the bronchoscopy suite in order to have each 
procedure last approximately an hour.  Procedures to be included will be biopsy 
based procedures (some of these are done with ultrasound, some with 
fluoroscopy).

b) Data Management   
 
Sample size and power considerations  
 
We propose two -arm study with 40 subjects per group: group 1) Sugammadex 2 
mg/kg for reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade or 4 mg/kg for deep 
block and group 2) Neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for reversal of moderate 
neuromuscular blockade. To evaluate statistical power for primary endpoint of 
recovery time to TOF>0.9, the size of detectable standard deviation unit (SDU) 
was calculated. The SDU corresponds to a beta coefficient in a regression model 
when we assume the standard normal deviate (i.e. N(0,1) ).  Using the same 
assumptions above, this study will have 83.8% power to detect an SDU of 2/[ADDRESS_253923] with a 5% two -sided significance level.  
 
The assumed SDU of 2/[ADDRESS_253924] size. Based on 
Couto 2019 Curr ent Clinical Pharmacol ogy, the estimated SDU is 1 between 
Sugammadex for moderate blockade (mean 1.68 SD 0.47 minutes) and 
Sugammadex for deep blockade (mean 2.85 SD 1.17). When comparing 
Neostigmine to Sugammadex, the much larger SDU is expected based on 
Hristo rska 2018 Anesthesia  (recovery time to TOF>0.9 ranging from 8.43 to 16.7 
minutes).

c) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subject s 
The PI, [CONTACT_212049] will be notified immediately about any 
complication during or after the bronchoscopy  procedure. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_212032].  
d) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Enrolled patients will be withdrawn from the research without their consent 
for any of the following reasons: if the surgery is c onverted to an open 
procedure or has other serious surgical complications as per surgeon, if a 
surgical complication results in the removal of the TwitchView monitoring 
system, or there is an impairment to the anesthesiologist ’s or nurse 
anesthetist ’s ability to follow protocol.  
The enrolled patient will be able to withdraw prior to induction of 
anesthesia on the day of the procedure. If a patient decides after awaking 
from anesthesia or at any time after his or her surgery to withdraw from 
the study they will be able to do so. If the patient desires their data be 
removed from the study, it will be destroyed and not used in the study.

Sugammadex  (also known as Bridion® )  
Muscles are activated by [CONTACT_212044].  Neuromuscular blocking 
drugs bind at the nerve -muscle interaction site and stop the nerve signals from reaching 
the muscles.  When used as part of standard of care treatment, Sugammadex binds to t he 
neuromuscular blocking drug and prevents and disrupts binding to the nerve -muscle 
interaction site to the muscle can receive information from the nerves once again.

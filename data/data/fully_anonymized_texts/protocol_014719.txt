non-target lesion treated.   
• One lesion must meet the angiographic criteria for a target lesion 
as described above, and is appropriate to be treated with a 
SYNERGY 48 mm coronary stent.  
• A maximum of 1 non-target lesion in 1 non- target vessel may be 
treated with a commercial treatment (e.g., stent, balloon angioplasty, excluding brachytherapy) during the index procedure. If stenting is appropriate for the treatment of a non- target lesion, 
an everolimus-eluting stent should be used.  The non- target vessel 
should be treated during the index procedure prior to the treatment of the target lesion and deemed an angiographic success.

  4. Introduction  
The EVOLVE 48 trial is designed to assess the FDA requirement for safety and effectiveness 
of the SYNERGY 48  mm Coronar y Stent System for the treatment of subjects with 
atherosclerotic lesion(s) >  34 mm and ≤ 44 mm in length (by [CONTACT_13729]) in native 
coronary arteries ≥2.5 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by [CONTACT_13729]).  Sites outside the [LOCATION_002] are being inclu ded in this protocol to collect additional [ADDRESS_374561]- market safety and 
performance data for the current CE Marked 48 mm device. The SYNERGY Stent System represents the next gen eration drug- eluting stent (DES) from [LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation 
(BSC, Marlborough [LOCATION_005], [LOCATION_002]).   The Stent System is based on the well 
characterized Element™ stent platform and utilizes a bioabsorbable poly(DL- lactide- co-
glycolide) (PL GA) polymer to deliver everolimus.  The SYNERGY stent incorporates a 
number of features designed to improve vascular healing and thus potentially reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis and the need for prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy. First, the polymer coating is only applied to the abluminal surface of the stent. The inside surface of the stent - the side in contact [CONTACT_306063] – is bare metal. Second, the polymer 
degrades within 4 months leaving only the biologically inert bare- metal platf orm behind ( 1).  
The SYNERGY stent system is approved and commercially available in the following sizes (stent diameter and length) as shown in the following device matrix.  In addition, the [ADDRESS_374562] agent had a tendency to be lower, and 
procedural costs were significantly less  (2).

   Clinical Development Program for SYNERGY 4.1.
The safety and effectiveness of the Element stent platform in combination with everolimus  in 
the form of the PROMUS Element stent has been established in the PLATINUM Clinical 
Trial Program (3-18). The EVOLVE series of trials including EVOLVE, EVOLVE II, and 
EVOLVE II QCA, have established the safety and effectiveness of the SYNERGY Stent System for the treatment of coronary artery lesions.  
 EVOLVE First Human Use ( FHU) Clinical Trial 4.1.1.
The EVOLVE trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blind, non- inferiority 
trial evaluating the safety and performance of two dose formulations of the SYNERGY stent, 
SYNERGY FHU s tent (dose and release profile similar to PROMUS Element) and 
SYNERGY FHU (1/2 Dose) stent (similar release profile and half the dose of PROMUS 
Element) in 291 subjects for the treatment of de novo lesions ≤28 mm in length in a native 
coronary artery 2.25–3.5 mm (visual estimate). The primary clinical endpoint of the EVOLVE trial was the 30 -day TLF rate defined as a composite of cardiac death or MI related 
to the target vessel, or ischemia -driven TLR. The primary angiographic endpoint was in- stent 
late loss as measured by [CONTACT_306064] 6 months. The 30- day TLF rate was 0%, 1.1%, and 3.1% in 
the PROMUS Element, SYNERGY FHU, and SYNERGY FHU (1/2 Dose) groups respectively. All TLF events in the SYNERGY groups were attributable to target vessel related periprocedural no n-Q-wave MIs. At 6 months, the TLF rate was 3.1%, 2.2%, and 
4.1% in the PROMUS Element, SYNERGY FHU, and SYNERGY FHU (1/2 Dose) groups respectively. Through [ADDRESS_374563] MIs, cardiac deaths, or stent thromboses in any group. The 6-month primary angiographic endpoint of in- stent late loss 
was 0.15±0.34 mm, 0.10±0.25 mm, and 0.13±0.26 mm for PROMUS Element, SYNERGY FHU, and SYNERGY FHU (1/2 Dose) respectively. The upper one-sided 95.2% confidence limit of the difference between test and cont rol for SYNERGY FHU was 0.02 and 
SYNERGY FHU (1/2 Dose) was 0.05; both lower than the pre- specified non -inferiority 
margin of 0.20 mm ( P for non -inferiority <0.001)  (19).  At [ADDRESS_374564] MIs, or stent thromboses in any group ( 20,21). The stu dy is 
now considered complete with regard to the primary endpoint and follow-up through [ADDRESS_374565] to TLF, cardiac death or MI . 
• Trend toward lower rates of TLR with SYNERGY vs PROMUS Element  
• No definite/probable stent thrombosis in any group at 5 years 
These results support the safety and efficacy of the novel abluminal bioabsorbable polymer SYNERGY everolimus -eluting stent for th e treatment of patients with de novo coronary 
artery disease( 22).

   EVOLVE II Clinical Program  4.1.2.
The SYNERGY stent is currently being evaluated in the EVOLVE II global clinical program 
for the treatment of subjects with  a maximum of 3 de novo atherosclerotic lesions. The 
program includes the EVOLVE II trial, which comprises a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with single -arm diabetic (DM) and pharmacokinetic (PK) substudies, and the EVOLVE II 
Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) study as detailed below and in Table 4.1-1. 
• The randomized controlled trial (RCT) at 125 global centers enrolled 1,684 subjects 
(1:1 randomization of SYNERGY to PROMUS Element Plus) with a maximum of 3 
atherosclerotic lesions ≤34 mm in length (by [CONTACT_13729]) in native coronary 
arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by [CONTACT_13729]).  This study completed 
enrollment in August, [ADDRESS_374566] primary endpoint of 12-month target lesion failure (TLF), defined as 
ischemia -driven target lesion revasculariz ation (TLR), target vessel -related MI, or 
cardiac death, was observed in 6.7% of SYNERGY and 6.5% PROMUS Element Plus treated subjects by [CONTACT_7586] -to-treat analysis (p=0.0005 for non- inferiority) and 
6.4% in both groups by [CONTACT_306065] (p=0.0003 for non- inferiority). With 
respect to 1 -year TLF SYNERGY is non -inferior to PROMUS Element Plus. 
Clinically -indicated TLR and definite/probable stent thrombosis were observed in 
2.6% vs 1.7% (p=0.21) and 0.4% vs 0.6% (p=0.50) of SYNERGY vs. PROMUS Element Plus treated subjects, respectively  (24). 
• A concurrent, non-randomized, diabetic (DM) substudy at 48 global centers enrolled 
an additional 203 SYNERGY diabetic subjects with atherosclerotic lesions ≤ 34 mm 
in length (by [CONTACT_13729]) in native coronary arteries ≥ 2.25 mm to ≤ 4.0 mm in 
diameter (by [CONTACT_13729]) .  Enrollment was complete in December, [ADDRESS_374567] (263 subjects) were pooled with diabetic 
subjects enrolled in the single-arm DM substudy (203 subjects) for a total of 466 diabetic subjects treated with SYNERGY stents. The primary endpoint of 12-month TLF was met. In the intention- to-treat analysis, the rate of TLF was 7.5% in 
SYNERGY treated diabetic subjects which is significantly less tha n the performance 
goal (14.5%; P <0.0001). Definite or probable stent thrombosis occurred in 1.1% of 
subjects  (25,26).  
• A concurrent, non-randomized, pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy at 6 centers enrolled 
21 subjects with atherosclerotic lesions ≤ 34 mm in l ength (by [CONTACT_13729]) in 
native coronary arteries ≥ 2.25 mm to ≤ 4.0 mm in diameter (by [CONTACT_13729]) to 
evaluate everolimus blood levels following stent implantation .  Enrollment was 
complete in October, 2013. 
• The EVOLVE II QCA study was a prospective, single- arm, multicenter, 
observational study that enrolled 100 subjects at 12 centers with atherosclerotic 
lesion(s) ≤34 mm in length (by [CONTACT_13729]) in native coronary arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by [CONTACT_13729]) .  Enrollment w as complete in October,

complete.  
The EVOLVE II QCA primary endpoint analysis of in- stent late loss at [ADDRESS_374568]-index procedure, was 0.23±0.34 mm (in 95 subjects) which was significantly less than the performance goal of 0.40 mm (p<0.0001). There were no deaths and no subject experienced a definite, probable or possible stent thrombosis through [ADDRESS_374569] myocardial infarctions 
(5.0%) according to the protocol definition (with peri-procedural MI defined based on

Subjects will be treated with The SYNERGY Everolimus -Eluting Platinum Chromium 
Coronary Stent System (SYNERGY Stent System), 48 mm in length; refer  to Section 5.0 
(Device Description) for study device product matrix.  
 Target and Non- target Lesions  8.2.1.
A target lesion is the lesion selected by [CONTACT_306066]. 
The target lesion includes the arterial segment treated with  the study stent plus the arterial 
segment [ADDRESS_374576] meet the angiographic criteria described above, and is appropriate to be treated with a SYNERGY 48 mm coronary stent. A maximum of 1 non-target lesion in 1 non- target 
vessel may be treated with a commercial treatment (e.g., stent, balloon angiop lasty, 
excluding brachytherapy) during the index procedure. If stenting is appropriate for the treatment of a non -target lesion, an everolimus-eluting stent should be used.  The non- target 
lesion should be treated first and should be deemed an angiographic  success prior to the 
treatment of the target lesion.  
Note:  Angiographic success is a mean lesion diameter stenosis < 50% (< 30% for stents) in 
[ADDRESS_374577] pain or ECG changes consistent with MI.

  Note : Multiple focal stenoses will be considered as a single lesion if they can be completely 
covered with 1 study stent. 
Predilitation/pretreatment of the target lesion  is required in this trial. If the target lesion is not 
successfully predilated/pretreated, the subject should not be enrolled. If a non -target lesion is 
to be treated, it should be treated first and must be deemed an angiographic success .  
Following the successful treatment of the non-target lesion, predilation of the target lesion 
may then be performed.   
Note:  Successful predilatation/pretreatment refers to dilatation with a balloon catheter of 
appropriate length and diameter, or pretreatment with directional or rotational coronary 
atherectomy, laser or cutting/scoring balloon with no greater than 50% residual stenosis and no dissection greater than National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI) type C 
 Justification for the Study Design  8.3.
The EVOLVE 48 trial will evaluate the FDA requirement for safety and effectiveness of the 
SYNERGY stent for the treatment of subjects with atherosclerotic lesion(s) > 34 mm and ≤ 44 mm in length (by [CONTACT_13729]) in native coronary arteries ≥2.5 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by [CONTACT_13729]).   Safety and performance has been demonstrated for this stent

A Screening Log will be maintained to document selected information about subjects who 
fail to meet the EVOLVE  48 trial eligibility criteria, including the reason for screen failure. 
   Informed Consent  11.3.
Before any study specific tests or procedures are performed, subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be asked to sign the IRB/IEC -approved study ICF.  Subjects must be given 
ample time to review the ICF and have questions answered before signing. 
In the US, subjects must sign the ICF prior to the procedure. Study personnel should explain 
to the subject that even if the subject agrees to participate in the trial and signs the ICF, 
cardiac catheterization may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable candidate for the trial.  
In Europe and New Zealand , the subject must sign the ICF within [ADDRESS_374589] procedure.

or enoxaparin) during the interventional portion of the procedure. If heparin is used, maintenance of an activated clotting time (ACT) >250 seconds throughout the interventional portion of the procedure is recommended. If enoxaparin or bivalirudin is used for procedural anticoagulation, monitoring of the anticoagulation level should be performed according to local laboratory practice.  
Note : Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban ma y be used at the discretion of the Investigator. 
To eliminate coronary artery spasm that would interfere with accurate measurement of lumen obstruction due to plaque alone, intracoronary nitroglycerin (NTG) or isosorbide dinitrate 
(ISDN) should be administered prior to the baseline angiogram. A dose of 100-200 µg of 
NTG is preferred; however, a 50  µg dose of NTG may be administered at the Investigator’s

   Cardiac Catheterization  11.6.
  Index Procedure  11.6.1.
The start of the index procedure is defined as the time of sheath insertion. If a previously 
placed sheath is used (i.e., from a separate diagnostic procedure), index procedure start time 
is defined as the time of guide catheter insertion into sheath for the interventional procedure.  
During cardiac catheterization, the following procedures and assessments must be completed.  
• Angiography should be performed according to the Angiographic Core Laboratory 
procedure guidelines.  
• Confirm angiographic eligibility criteria of lesio n(s). 
• Pre-dilate/pretreat the target lesion and non- target lesion  (if applicable ) 
Note : Balloon catheter predilatation/pretreatment is required for the target lesion  and non-
target lesion (if applicable) . The target lesion must be successfully predilated /pretreated in 
order for the subject to be eligible for enrollment. Unsuccessful predilatation/pretreatment of the target lesion excludes the subject from enrollment in this trial. The subject should be 
treated per local standard of care, but must not be e nrolled or receive a study stent  
If a non- target lesion is to be treated, it should be treated prior to the target lesion and should 
be deemed an angiographic success.  Following the successful treatment of the non- target 
lesion, predilation of the target lesion may then be performed. 
Note: Successful predilatation/pretreatment refers to dilatation with a balloon catheter of 
appropriate length and diameter, or pretreatment with directional or rotational coronary 
atherectomy, laser or cutting/scoring balloon with no greater than 50% residual stenosis and no dissection greater than NHLBI type C.

  Note:  Per AE6 (Table 9.3-1), the planned treatment should not result in overlap of the study 
stent with a previously placed stent. 
• If stenting is required in a bailout situation within the target vessel, it is recommended the 
stent be a SYNERGY stent or another everolimus eluting  stent .   
o Bailout typi[INVESTIGATOR_306037] a peri -stent dissection but can also include a vessel 
complication at the ostium or along the course of the major coronary artery used to 
access the target lesion.  
o The decision of whether to treat in a bailout situation is at the discretion of the Interventionalist.  
o In cases of bailout, the stent used should be documented in the eCRF.    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stent Placement  
Refer to the DFU for detailed instructions about preparation and placement of the SYNERGY stent.  
  Post Stent Deployment Procedures  11.6.2.
After stent placement, the Investigator should ensure that the stent is in full contact [CONTACT_306068]. In order to achieve full contact, postdilatation may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator using the stent delivery system balloon or other balloon catheter.  
Peri-stent dissections should be treated conservatively, with low pressure prolonged balloon 
inflation, or with additional stent implantation per standard practice. Haziness, lucency, or filling defects within or adjacent to the stent, and angiographic complications such as distal 
thromboemboli or no reflow, should also be treated per standard practice. All angiographic complications that occur should be documented by [CONTACT_306069] f or analysis.  
To eliminate coronary artery spasm that would interfere with accurate measurement of lumen obstruction due to plaque alone, NTG or ISDN should be administered prior to the final 
angiogram. A dose of at least 100  µg of NTG is preferred; however , a 50 µg dose of NTG 
may be administered at the Investigator’s discretion when deemed clinically necessary. 
Alternatively, if ISDN is administered, a dose of 2 -3 mg is recommended.  
  End of the Index Procedure 11.7.
The end of the index procedure is defined as the time the guiding catheter was removed (post final angiography). The introducer(s) sheaths should be removed as per standard local practice. The following procedures must be completed:  
• Document procedural, target lesion, non- target lesion  (if applicable) , pre-dilatation, post-
dilatation (if applicable), and study stent information on the appropriate eCRFs. 
• Record antithrombotic medications

• The expected 12 -month TLF rate for SYNERGY = 9.2%; estimated by [CONTACT_306071] 
(6.6%) for SYNERGY in EVOLVE  II RCT and  a 40% relative  increase for TLF due to 
longer lesion length ( assuming a relative 20% increase in rates for every 10  mm increase 
in mean lesion length) with an expected mean lesion length of [ADDRESS_374604]  (mean lesion length of 16 mm for SYNERGY arm), i.e. 
6.6% * (1 + 20%* 2) = 9.2% 
• The Performance Goal = 19.5% ; based on E VOLVE  II-like patients with lesion length 
greater than [ADDRESS_374605]-Approval Study and  PE-Prove Study. The pooled historical 12 month TVF rate 
related to study stent from the se 2 studies (6.7% (3/45) and 0% (0/12), respectively) is 
5.3% (3/57) with the corresponding exact binominal one-sided 95% upper CI of 13%. The expected  control rate for the se long lesion patients is chosen to be the exact binomial 
one-sided  95% upper CI of 13% of the pooled historical rate accounting for the lack of 
systematic post- procedural enzyme collection in the Post -Approval studies, small sample 
size and  the event rate variability  between studies. The PG is set to be 19.5% (expected 
control rate 13% + delta, where delta is chosen to be relative 50% of the expected control 
rate of 13% = 6.5%) 
• Test significance level ( α) = 0.05 (1- sided)  
• Power (1−β) ≥ 0.80  
• N = 95 evaluable patients  
• Expected attrition  rate = 5%  
• N=100 enrolled patients 
• The worst observed rate allowable for meeting the PG of 19.5% is 12% (12/100) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
A one-group Clopper- Pearson exact test will be used to test whether the 12 ‑month TLF rate 
for SYNERGY is less than  the PG.

<0.05 in both the per-protocol and ITT populations. This corresponds to the one- sided  95% 
upper confidence bound on the observed 12-month TLF rate from SYNERGY being less than the PG. 
 Control of Systematic Error/Bias 12.2.2.
Selection of subjects will be made from the Investigator's usual subject load. All subjects 
meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible to enroll in the trial. Consecutively eligible subjects should be enrolled into the study to minimize selection bias. In determining subject eligibility for the study, the investigator’s assessment of ang iographic parameters before stent placement will be used. However, the Angiographic 
Core Laboratory will independently analyze the angiograms and the data obtained from the core lab will be used for analyses in order to control for inter-observer variability. An independent CEC composed of expert cardiologists will adjudicate all reported events of death, MI, TVR, and stent thrombosis. 
 Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  12.2.3.
Investigative sites are recommended to enroll preferably a minimum of 6 subjects but no 
more than 20 subjects (20% of the total number of subjects) in the trial.  
 Data Analyses 12.3.
Baseline data will be summarized, post-procedure information will be collected at regularly 
scheduled follow- up examinations as detailed in the clinical trial sc hedule and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and n, minimum, maximum) and frequency tables or proportions for discrete variables.  Estimates of primary and other endpoints will be reported and their 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  No formal statistical testing will be done for other endpoints.

 Justification of Pooling 12.3.4.
In the analysis to justify pooling across centers, the centers with fewer than 6 subjects 
enrolled in the study will be combined into “virtual centers” based on geographic region so that “virtual centers” have ≥[ADDRESS_374607] of potential 
predictors on the primary endpoint of 12 month TLF using Logistic regression. Analyses may also be performed for pre -specified clinical endpoints, if feasible; liner regression may be 
used for continuous outcomes and Cox proportional hazards regression may be used to assess the effects of possible pred ictors in a time -to-event manner.  
Variables from the following categories will be considered as possible predictors: demographics, medical history, coronary artery disease risk factors, procedural characteristics, baseline angiographic measurements, and medication used during study 
procedure.

  18. Monitoring  
Monitoring will be performed during the study, according to the Monitoring Plan, to assess 
continued compliance with the current, approved protocol /amendment (s)  and applicable 
regulations. In addition, the clinical research monitor verifies that informed consent is 
obtained from all enrolled study subjects, study records are adequately maintained, that data are reported in a satisfactory manner with respect to timeliness, adequacy, and accuracy, and that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_306040] s afely and effectively.   Monitoring strategies will be tailored to risks, and will be 
focused on critical processes and critical data. Monitoring activities will be adjusted based on the issues and risks identified throughout the study.  Pre-defined thresholds for protocol deviation and compliance once met or exceeded, can also trigger increased monitoring frequency and/or the implementation of corrective action plans at clinical sites. Source documents include, at a minimum but not limited to, the ICF; subj ect medical records, 
including nursing records and catheterization laboratory records; diagnostic imaging records; laboratory results; and reports of SAEs and device accountability logs. Data documented in the eCRF relevant to device deficiencies, relation ship of AE to study device(s), index 
procedure, and antiplatelet medication; and anticipatedness assessment of ADEs, may be considered source data for the study .   
A risk -based approach to source data verification will be implemented as described in the 
Monitoring Plan.  The monitoring plan for EVOLVE 48 will include source data verification 
of critical data for a sampling of subjects enrolled and review of 100% of ICFs for all 
subjects.

  Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  19.3.
The anticipated adverse device effects (ADE) have been identified and are listed in section 
19.1 and 19.2.   
  Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  19.4.
The SYNERGY stent releases everolimus via a bioabsorbable PLGA polymer. This polymer formulation has previously been used to achieve controlled release of everolimus in the SYNERGY FHU stent in the EVOLVE trial. The SYNERGY stent has also been used in the EVOLVE II program, for which primary endpoint results and follow up through [ADDRESS_374613] demonstrated the safety and performance o f other drug -
eluting stents that use similar polymer formulations to control the release of pharmaceutical agents from a coronary stent ( 28-30) . These clinical trials, in combination with the EVOLVE 
trials, suggest that the risk associated with the SYNERGY stent is comparable to other drug -
eluting coronary stents. When considering the incremental risk of using a 48 mm stent versus a shorter stent, it is conceivable that it might be more challenging to deliver a 48  mm stent 
than a shorter stent.  If it is not possible to deliver a 48 mm stent – use of two overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_306045] a bailo ut option. Another consideration is the vessel tapering which could potentially 
be more pronounced in a longer stent. However, vessel tapering is expected to affect the post- dilation strategy more than stent selection.   The overexpansion capabilities of 
SYNERGY provide adequate margin for the anticipated variation in vessel size.

    Sex-Specific Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  19.5.
An Analysis of subjects treated with everolimus- eluting stents in the EVOLVE II RCT study 
was performed to assess the impact of gender on outcomes.  Difference in treatment and 
gender are observed.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_306046], the overall conclusions of the trial regarding both safety and effectiveness of the SYNERGY Stent can be generalized to males and females.  However, the influence of gender on long- term drug -eluting stent outcomes has not 
been fully elucidated.  
  Risks Associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  19.6.
In addition to the aforementioned risks associated with the implantation of coronary stents and the use of everolimus, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy after stent implantation may increase the risk of bleeding. There may be additional risks linked to the procedure which are unforeseen at this time.  
  Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments  19.7.
The following describes known drug interactions for orally administered everolimus at significantly higher doses than are present on the PROMUS Element Plus and SYNERGY stents. Interactions observed at these higher doses may not be relevant to the PROMUS Element Plus and SYNERGY stents.  
When taken orally, everolimus is extensively metab olized by [CONTACT_35233] P4503A4 
(CYP3A4) in the gut wall and liver and is a substrate for the countertransporter P glycoprotein. Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of everolimus may be influenced by [CONTACT_306078]. Concurre nt treatment with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers is not recommended unless the benefits outweigh the risk. Inhibitors of P glycoprotein may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro, everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6), potentially increasing the concentrations of drugs eliminated by [CONTACT_36918]. Thus, caution should be exercised when co-administering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic 
index (42).  
Everolimus has also been shown to reduce the clearance of some prescription medications 
when it was administered orally along with cyclosporine. Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with the SYNERGY stent. Therefore, due consideration should be given to the potential for both systemic and local drug interactions in the vessel wall when deciding to place the SYNERGY stent in a subject taking a drug with known interaction with everolimus.  
Everolimus, when prescribed as an oral medication, may interact with the following drugs or 
substances.  
• CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers [verapamil and

  Risk Minimization Actions  19.8.
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365], adherence to subject selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow-ups and by [CONTACT_71653].  
  Anticipated Benefits  19.9.
Anticipated benefits include the effective treatment of coronary artery stenosis and improvement in the symptoms of coronary artery disease. Subjects who receive the SYNERGY stent may have better vessel healing, a lower risk of stent thrombosis, and less of 
a need for prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy. Regarding specifically the use of a long stent, clinical data form the TAXUS ATLAS Long Lesion trial suggests a benefit of treatment with a single long stent versus multiple o verlappi[INVESTIGATOR_196521] ( 31). It is also conceivable that the use 
of one versus two overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_306047], exposure to irradiation and procedure time. However, given there are no clinical data on the SYNERGY 
48 mm stent these potential benefits may or may not actually be present  
 Risk to Benefit Rationale 19.10.
The 48 mm SYNERGY stent is expected to be suitable for its intended purpose. There are no 
new patient harms associated with the use of a 48  mm SYNERGY stent versus using a 
shorter SYNERGY stent. There are no unacceptable residual risks/intolerable risks and all 
applicable risks have been addressed through the provision of appropriate Directions for Use. Evaluation of the risks and benefits that are expected to be associated with use of the 48 mm SYNERGY stent demonstrate that when used under the conditions intended, the benefits 
associated with use of the 48 mm SYNERGY stent should outweigh the risks.

  20. Safety Reporting 
  Reportable Events  by [CONTACT_142186]  20.1.
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to BSC any event which occurs 
in any of following categories: 
• All serious adverse events (SAE)   
• All CEC events inclusive of death, MI *, TVR and stent thrombosis  
• All A dverse Device Effects ( ADE)  
• All SYNERGY 48  mm Device Deficiencies  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects  
• New findings/updates in relation to already reported events  
 
* MI should be reported per protocol definition.  If pre -procedure cardiac enzymes  were not 
drawn, but the event otherwise meets the protocol definition of MI, the event should be 
reported as an MI for CEC adjudication.   
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms. If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency.  
Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation.  Death should not be recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of ONE (1) specific SAE (see Table 20.2- 1 for AE 
definitions).

  [LOCATION_011] Scientific Device Deficiencies  20.5.
All SYNERGY 48  mm device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, 
malfunctions, use errors, product nonconformities, and inadequacy in the information 
supplied by [CONTACT_3455] ) will be documented and reported to BSC. If possible, the 
device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the investigational device(s) will be provided in the MOP. If it is not possible to return the device, the investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final 
disposition of the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
Device deficiencies  (including but not limited to failures, ma lfunctions, and product 
nonconformities) are not adverse events ; they should be reported on the appropriate eCRF 
per the study CRF Completion Guidelines.  If an adverse event results from a device failure or malfunction, the AE should be recorded as an adverse event on the appropriate eCRF if it 
meets the protocol-specified definition of a reportable event. 
Any Device Deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) suitable action 
had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate is considered a reportable event.  
  Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / Investigators  20.6.
BSC is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all participating Principal Investigators and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation will notify all participating study centers if SAEs/SADEs 
occur which imply a possible increase in the anticipated risk of the procedure or use of the device or if the occurrence of certain S AEs/SADEs demands changes to the protocol or the 
conduct of the study in order to further minimize the unanticipated risks.

In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, 
the presence of, addition, or deletion of satellite sites or following annual review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. Acceptance by [CONTACT_5755]’s 
IRB/EC. The IRB/EC will determine the subject population to be re- consented.  
Study personnel should explain to the subject that even if the subject agrees to participate in the trial and signs the ICF, cardiac catheterization may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable candidate for the trial. A Screening Log will be maintained to document select information about candidates who fail to meet the EVOLVE 48trial eligibility criteria, including, but not limited to, the reason for screen failure. 
22. Committees  
  Safety Monitoring Process 22.1.
To promote early detection of safety issues, BSC processes will provide accelerated 
evaluation of safety events. Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported. 
This is expedited through BSC’s Global 
Safety Office, which is responsible for coordinating the collection of information for the subject 
dossier from the sites and Angiographic Core Laboratory.  During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, the clinical research monitors will support the dynamic reporting process through their review of source document information.

  ABRUPT CLOSURE  
Abrupt closure is the occurrence of new severely reduced flow (TIMI grade 0 or 1) within the 
target vessel that persists and requires bailout, including emergency surgery, or results in MI or death. Abrupt closure requires proven association with a mechanical dissection of the treatment site or instrumented vessel, coronary thrombus, or severe spasm. Abrupt closure does not connote “no reflow” due to microvascular flow limitation in which the epi[INVESTIGATOR_306052]. Abrupt closure also does not connote transient closure with reduced flow in which the assigned treatment reversed the closure. 
Sub- abrupt closure is an abrupt closure that occurs after the target procedure is completed 
and the subject has left the catheterization laborat ory and before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
Threatened abrupt closure is a grade B dissection and ≥ 50% diameter stenosis or any 
dissection of grade C or higher.

  HYPOTENSION  
Sustained hypotension is a systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg lasting more than 
30 minutes or requiring intervention (e.g., pacing, IABP, intravenous vasopressors, to sustain systolic blood pressure). This excludes transient hypotension or vagal reactions, which are self-limited or readily reversible.  
INDEX PROCEDURE START TIME  
Index procedure start time is defined as the time of sheath insertion. If a previously placed sheath is used (i.e., from an earlier diagnostic procedure), index procedure start time is defined as the time of guide catheter insertion into sheath for the interventional procedure.

Index procedure end time is defined as the time the guide catheter is removed after the final 
angiography.  
INTIMAL FLAP  
An intimal flap is an extension of the vessel wall into the arterial lume n. 
LEFT MAIN DISEASE  
Left main disease is a significant lesion in the left main coronary artery of at least 50% diameter stenosis. A protected left main artery means left main with a functioning graft, either venous or arterial, placed to any of the branch es of the left main. This is usually the 
LAD or CX, but could also include one of the branches of those vessels. Having a stent in the left main coronary artery does not in itself constitute a protected left main.

• Type  A lesions: Minimally complex, length <10  mm, concentric, readily accessible, 
non-angulated segment (<45 °), smooth contour, little or no calcification, less than totally 
occlusive, not ostial in location, no major side branch involvement, and an absence of 
thrombus. 
• Type  B lesions: Moderately complex, tubular (length 10 to 20 mm), eccentric, moderate 
tortuosity of proximal segment, moderately angulated segment (>45°, <90 °), irregular 
contour, moderate or heavy calcification, total occlusions <3 mo nths old, ostial in 
location, bifurcation lesions requiring double guidewire, and some thrombus present. 
• Type  C lesions: Severely complex, diffuse (length ≥ 20 mm), excessive tortuosity of 
proximal segment, extremely angulated segments >90 °, total occlusions >3  months old 
and/or bridging collaterals, inability to protect major side branches, and degenerated vein grafts with friable lesions.  
 
LESION LENGTH  
Lesion length is measured as distance from the proximal to the distal shoulder in the view that demonstrates the stenosis in its most elongated projection. Lesion length is classified as discrete (<10  mm), tubular (10-20 mm), or diffuse (>20  mm).

NON- TARGET LESION  
A non-target lesion is any lesion treated during the index procedure which is not a target lesion. A maximum of 1 non- target lesion in 1  non- target vessel may be treated with a 
commercial treatment (e.g., stent, balloon angioplasty, excluding brachytherapy) during the index procedure.  
PERFORATION  
Perforations are classified as follows:  
• Angiographic perforation: Perforation detected by [CONTACT_306091]. 
• Clinical perforation: Perforation requiring additional treatment, including efforts to seal the perforation or pericardial drainage, or resulting in significant pericardial effusion, 
abrupt closure, MI, or death. 
• Pericardial hemorrhage/tamponade: Perforation causing tamponade.  
 
PROLONGED ANGINA PECTORIS

  PSEUDOANEURYSM  
A pseudoaneurysm is an encapsulated hematoma in communication with an artery. It is often 
difficult to distinguish from an expanding hematoma at the site of arterial puncture. It usually requires surgical repair.  
REFERENCE DIAMETER OF NORMAL ARTERY SEGMENT  
Reference diameter of the normal artery segment is an angiographic measurement of the artery proximal and/or distal to the lesion intended for angioplasty. This is also referred to as “reference vessel diameter” (RVD).  
REPEAT INTERVENTION  
Repeat intervention is a PCI or CABG performed after the end of the index procedure. The repeat intervention should be performed to improve blood flow. 
RESTENOSED LESION  
A restenosed lesion is a previously treated lesion that again has a stenosis. RESTENOSIS  
See Binary Restenosis.

STENT THROMBOSIS ( Ref: Academic Research Consortium Definition ) (32) 
Stent thrombosis should be reported as a cumulative value at the different time points and 
with the different separate time points. Time 0 is defined as the time point after the guide catheter has been removed and the patient left the catheterization lab.  
Timing: 
• Acute stent thrombosis*: 0-24 hours after stent implantation  
• Subacute stent thrombosis*: >24 hours to 30 days after stent implantation  
• Late stent thrombosis: >30 days to 1 year after stent implantation  
• Very late stent thrombosis: >1  year after stent implantation  
* Acute/subacute can also be replaced by [CONTACT_196591]. Early stent thrombosis is 
0-30 days.  
Stent thrombosis may be defined as: 
• Confirmed/definite  
• Probable 
• Possible 
Confirmed/Definite  (is considered either  angiographic confirmed or pathologic confirmed) 
Angiographic confirmed stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred if: • TIMI flo w is:  
TIMI flow grade 0 with occlusion originating in the stent or in the segment 5 mm proximal 
or distal to the stent region in the presence of thrombus* 
TIMI flow grade 1, 2 or 3 originating in the stent or in the segment 5 mm proximal or distal 
to the stent region in the presence of a thrombus* 
AND at least one of the following criteria, up to 48  hours, has been fulfilled: 
• New onset of ischemic symptoms at rest (typi[INVESTIGATOR_306058] >20  minutes)  
• New ischemic ECG changes suggestive of acute ischemia  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_196543] (>2× ULN of CK)  
 The incidental angiographic documentation of stent occlusion in the absence of clinical 
syndromes is not considered a confirmed stent thrombosis (silent thrombosis). 
* Intracoronary thrombus Non-occlusive thrombus : Spheric, ovoid or irregular non- calcified filling defect or lucency 
surrounded by [CONTACT_13800] (on 3 sides of within a coronary stenosis) seen in multiple 
projections, or persistence of contrast material within the lumen, or a visible embolization of intraluminal material downstream.

Clinical def inition of probable stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred in the 
following cases: 
• Any unexplained death within the first 30 days  
• Irrespective of the time after the index procedure and MI in the absence of any obvious 
cause which is related to documented acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted 
stent without angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis

STROKE /CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT  
An acute symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_196544] a vascular cause lasting more than 24 hours or lasting 24 hours or less with a brain imaging study or autopsy showing infarction. 
Classification: 
• Ischemic Stroke: An acute symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_196545], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or retinal 
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_196594]. 
• Hemorrhagic Stroke: An acute symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_306059] a nontraumatic intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. 
• Undetermined Stroke: A stroke with insufficient information to allow categorization as ischemic or hemorrhagic.  
An event that lasts < 24 hours may be adjudicated as a stroke if the f ollowing treatments 
were used:  
• Pharmacologic, i. e., thrombolytic drug administration, or 
• Non-pharmacologic, i.e., neurointerventional procedure ( e.g., intracranial angioplasty)  
 
SUCCESSFUL PREDILATATION/PRETREATMENT  
Successful predilatation /pretreatment refers to dilatation with a balloon catheter of 
appropriate length and diameter, or pretreatment with directional or rotational coronary 
atherectomy, laser or cutting/scoring balloon with no greater than 50% residual stenosis and no dissection greater than NHLBI type C.

the angiographic selection criteria.  
TARGET LESION FAILURE  
Target lesion failure is any ischemia -driven revascularization of the target lesion, MI (Q-
wave and non–Q- wave) related to the target vessel, or (cardiac) death. For the purposes of 
this protocol, if it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI was related to the 
target vessel, it will be considered a TLF.  
TARGET LESION REVASCULARIZATION 
Target lesion revascularization is  any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to 
improve blood flow, of the successfully treated target lesion or by[CONTACT_306094] a graft distally to the successfully treated target lesion. A TLR will be considered 
as isch emia -driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is ≥50% by [CONTACT_306095]. Clinical or functional ischemia is any of the following:  
• The subject has a positive functional study corresponding to the area served by [CONTACT_15738]. 
• The subject has ischemic ECG changes at rest in a distribution consistent with the target 
vessel.  
• The subject has ischemic symptoms referable to the target lesion.  
A TLR w ill be considered as ischemia -driven if the lesion diameter stenosis is ≥70% by 
[CONTACT_306096].  
TARGET VESSEL  
The target vessel is any coronary vessel (e.g., left main coronary artery, LAD, LCX, or RCA) 
containing a target lesion. Side branches of a target vessel such as the LAD are also considered part of the target vessel.  
Note:  In the EVOLVE 48 trial, the ramus will be considered to be a branch of the LCX for 
purposes of determining eligibility and for determining TVR. 
TARGET VESSEL FAILURE 
Target vessel failure is any ischemia -driven revascularization of the target vessel, MI (Q -
wave and non–Q- wave) related to the target vessel or death related to the target vessel. For 
the purposes of this protocol, if it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or 
death was related to the target vessel, it will be considered a TVF.  
TARGET VESSEL REVASCULARIZATION 
Target vessel revascularization is defined as a TLR (see definition above) or a TVR remote 
(see d efinition below). 
TARGET VESSEL REVASCULARIZATION REMOTE  
Target vessel revascularization remote is any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to improve blood flow, or by[CONTACT_306097] ≥50% by Q CA in the target vessel, excluding the target lesion. A TVR will

vessel.  
• The subject has ischemic symptoms referable to the target vessel.  
A TVR will also be considered as ischemia- driven if the lesion  diameter stenosis is ≥70% 
even in the absence of clinical or functional ischemia.  
TECHNICAL SUCCESS  
Technical success is successful delivery and deployment of the study stent to the target 
vessel, without balloon rupture or stent embolization, and post- procedure diameter stenosis 
of <30% in [ADDRESS_374628] for listing the filming sequence and angulations of x -ray 
equipment, details of inflations, and description of lesion(s). 
THROMBUS (ANGIOGRAPHIC)  
Thrombus (angiographic) is discrete, mobile intraluminal filling with defined borders 
with/without associated contrast straining, classified as either absent or present. 
THROMBOLYSIS IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION CLASSIFICATION 
• TIMI  0: No perfusion. 
• TIMI  1: Penetration with minimal perfusion. Contrast fails to opacify the entire bed distal 
to the stenosis of the duration of the cine run. 
• TIMI  2: Partial perfusion. Contrast opacifies the entire coronary bed distal to the stenosis. 
However, the rate of entry and/or clearance is slower in the coronary bed distal to the 
obstruction than in comparable areas not perfused by [CONTACT_306100]. 
• TIMI  3: Complete perfusion. Filling and clearance of contrast equally rapid in the 
coronary bed distal to stenosis as in other coronary beds. 
TOTAL OCCLUSION  
A total occlusion is a lesion with no flow (i.e., TIMI flow 0).  
TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK  
A TIA is a focal ischemic neurological deficit of abrupt onset and of presumed vascular etiology that resolves completely within [ADDRESS_374629] ( Ref: 21CFR Part 812)

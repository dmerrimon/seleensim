OBJECTIVES:
Objective 1:  To determine the efficacy of using blue light therapy to treat patients with 
Grover’s disease or psoriasis vulgaris (also known as plaque psoriasis). We will be 
using the PASI scale to determine the severity of psoriasis vulgaris before and after 
receiving blue light treatments. The hypothesis is that blue light will reduce the 
erythema, scaling, and induration of psoriatic plaques and the erythema, pruritus, and 
number of papules for patients with Grover’s disease.

HRP-593 /  v03152019Objective 2:  To determine the histopathological changes of skin biopsies and 
immunohistochemistry of skin-based T-cell markers in patient’s receiving blue light 
therapy in both Grover’s disease and psoriasis. To examine the serological markers of 
immune function and correlate them with histopathological or clinical signs of 
improvement.
BACKGROUND:
Transient acantholyic  dermatosis (Grover’s disease) is a rare skin disorder that presents 
most commonly as small, pruritic, erythematous papules on the trunk, particularly the 
central chest and back in males older than forty or fifty. The etiology is largely unknown, 
but the disease is thought to be associated with sweating and heat. The time course of 
Grover’s disease is variable: some patients present with a self-limited two to four week 
eruption or a persistent non-resolving pattern. A clinical diagnosis can be made, but it is 
often confirmed through skin biopsy demonstrating typi[INVESTIGATOR_117616].1
Psoriasis vulgaris  is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder that presents as 
erythematous, well-demarcated plaques with overlying silvery scale. It is associated 
numerous co-morbidities including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune 
disease. Psoriasis is caused by [CONTACT_117625] (T-cells and dendritic cells) and cytokines (TNF-alpha, Il-23, Il-12) that leads to 
abnormal differentiation in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], vascular dilation, and inflammatory cell 
recruitment.[ADDRESS_131270] shown improvement in erythema and the LPSI score before and after therapy3-4. 
Although these studies studied the clinical response of psoriasis to blue light, neither 
examined histopathological or serological evidence of the immune system after blue 
light therapy. This study will also control for confounding variables such as 10% salicylic 
petroleum gel and moisturizes that were used in these two studies.
Standard of  care treatment for Grover’s disease include high potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], 
application moisturizers, or emollients. Grover’s disease patients may also minimize 
symptoms by [CONTACT_117626]. 
Standard of  care for psoriasis include use of emollients, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] 
D, tar, calcineurin inhibitors, UV light phototherapy, and systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117617], retinoids, and biologic agents.

STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  / INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT(S):
The D[LOCATION_003] BLU-U  (Model 4170) is a Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is 
intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the body. Blue light therapy is indicated for 
dermatological conditions such as actinic keratosis (AK) or inflammatory acne vulgaris. 
The BLU-U is approved by [CONTACT_1622] (K031805) as a Class II medical device. 
The BLU-U Illuminator  to be used in this study is owned by [CONTACT_117629][INVESTIGATOR_117618]. 
PROCEDURES INVOLVE D:
Patients with Grover’s  Disease or Psoriasis vulgaris will be enrolled on the study. 
In the informed consent  process a Dermatologist will discuss Standard of Care 
treatment options for Grover’s Disease or psoriasis vulgaris. If the patient wishes not to 
participate in this study the SOC treatment will be available to them. If the patient 
chooses to participate in this study, they may elect to do SOC treatment at any time 
(ending participation early) or after the phototherapy study visits are complete. Patients 
receiving SOC phototherapy (other light type, with activator creams, etc) may participate 
in this study by [CONTACT_47506] a small site from their SOC phototherapy which will be treated 
with the Blue Light therapy in this trial. The Department of Dermatology has standard of 
care procedures for blocking specific sites during SOC phototherapy. These procedures 
will be followed if a patient that is enrolled on the study is simultaneously receiving SOC 
phototherapy for their condition. The clinical research team will consult with the 
phototherapy team for any patient that is receiving phototherapy. 
No procedures  in this study are standard of care for Grover’s Disease or psoriasis 
vulgaris. If the symptoms of resolve before all phototherapy sessions are completed, the 
patient will have their final assessment and will have completed the study. 
After informed  consent a patient will be scheduled to start the study sessions 
immediately (if not on medications) or after a period of two weeks without using 
medications related to their skin condition. A site on the body will be identified for 
treatment with Blue Light, this will be the same site treated throughout the study. 
The study  visits will take approximately 30 minutes and will be done three times a week 
(at least 23 hours apart) over five weeks (15 visits total). Each session will consist of 16

Before starting the first, seventh and after the last session the patient will have a single, 
6mm, punch biopsy of a characteristic lesion on the treated side only and a blood draw 
not exceeding 30 cc or two tablespoons in a visit. Tissue and blood, samples will be 
collected under the Dermatology Tissue Acquisition and Biorepository (IRB# 
STU00009443) protocol upon completion of the consent form for STU00009443.
During the first  and last study visit the patient will be asked to complete surveys relating 
to their comfort and experience with the phototherapy symptoms and psychometric 
surveys of skin-related symptoms and skin-related quality of life.
In addition  photographs will be taken of the afflicted areas before the first treatment, on 
the first visit, third visit after every 3 treatments until the end of the study as outlined in 
the table below.

phototherapy unit at Northwestern Dermatology for 15 total sessions of blue light 
therapy divided into 3 sessions a week for 5 weeks. The target irradiance is 14 mW/cm2 
with a total dose of 9 J/cm2 requiring ~16 min per treatment. At each treatment session, 
clinical photos will be taken along with blue-light dosimeter readings at various locations 
of the body. At the mid-point of the study (7 sessions), an additional biopsy will be taken 
of a characteristic lesion. At the end-point of the study (15 sessions), a final biopsy will 
be taken of a characteristic lesion. If the lesion(s) is/are resolved a biopsy will be done 
adjacent to a previous biopsy. Patients will be asked to complete psychometric surveys 
relating to their comfort and experience with the phototherapy symptoms. In addition, 
they will complete psychometric surveys of skin-related symptoms and skin-related 
quality of life to compare against baseline. Subjects on the therapy will be asked to 
refrain from using systemic treatments throughout the trial with a 2-week washout 
period before the start of the trial. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117619], except in the area

In a parallel  single arm, prospective clinical trial patients with psoriasis vulgaris (n=10) 
will be invited to participate. A baseline biopsy of a characteristic lesion will be 
performed. Patients will be asked to complete a baseline psychometric survey of skin-
related symptoms and skin-related quality of life. A baseline PASI-75 (a well-accepted 
clinical endpoint for psoriasis severity) will be conducted and across every treatment 
visit. Patients will then be asked to present to the phototherapy unit at Northwestern 
Dermatology for 15 total sessions of blue light therapy divided into 3 weekly sessions. 
The target irradiance is 14 mW/cm2 with a total dose of 9 J/cm2 requiring ~16 min per 
treatment. At each treatment session, clinical photos will be taken along with blue-light 
dosimeter readings at various locations of the body. At the mid-point of the study (7 
sessions), an additional biopsy will be taken of a characteristic lesion. At the end-point 
of the study (15 sessions), a final biopsy will be taken of a characteristic lesion. Patients 
will be asked to complete psychometric surveys relating to their comfort and experience 
with the phototherapy symptoms. In addition, they will complete psychometric surveys 
of skin-related symptoms and skin-related quality of life to compare against baseline. A 
final PASI-75 will be scored. Subjects on the therapy will be asked to refrain from using 
any systemic treatments throughout the trial with a 2-week washout period before the 
start of the trial. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117619], except in the area that is identified for

In partnership  with Northwestern University’s Skin Biology Disease Research Center 
(one of only 6 in the country), all skin biopsy results will be processed for standard 
histology as well as immunohistochemistry. All biopsies will be stained for T-cell 
biomarkers including CD4, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD8 with cell populations counted for 
biopsies taken at baseline, at the midpoint and at completion of 15 sessions of blue light 
therapy. Keratinocyte apoptotic biomarkers will also be collected.
Serological markers  will be drawn both at baseline and after treatment from blue light in 
both the Grover’s disease and psoriasis cohorts for immune-cell related cytokines (TNF-
α, C-reactive  protein, IL-6, E-selectin, and ICAM-1)

HRP-593 /  v03152019Procedures performed  to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks: 
Blue Light  phototherapy sessions will be done in a private clinic room to maintain 
privacy of the patient. The researchers and patient will wear protective eyewear during 
use of the BLU-U device. Eyewear will block light with wavelengths of at least 500nm 
and shorter with an Optical Density (OD) of two or greater as recommended by [CONTACT_117630], the manufacturer of the BLU-U.
Photographs taken for the  study will not include the full face and will exclude identifying 
marks such as tattoos. The intent of photographs is to document the efficacy of the 
treatment and any improvement of the disease. 
Standard, sterile  technique will be followed for both blood draws and punch biopsies. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117620]’s disease will be recorded and stored on 
research only devices (tablets/iPads). Those images will only be stored and accessed 
by [CONTACT_117631]. The photographs will be used to assess whether the blue 
light therapy has improved the skins disease is psoriasis and Grover’s disease.
DATA AND SPECIMEN  BANKING
The biopsies  and blood draws will not be stored for future use, and will be immediately 
used to histopathological examination and serological markers. Specimens will only be 
handled by [CONTACT_117632]. All research specimens will be labeled with a unique patient 
identifier, collection date and time. 
Upon completion  of consent, the biospy samples will also be shared with Dermatology 
Tissue Acquisition and Biorepository (IRB# STU00009443).
SHARING RESULTS WITH  PARTICIPANTS
The results of  the biopsies, and serological markers of the immune system will not be 
shared with the patient. At the end of the study a dermatologist will give an assessment 
of the patients condition and follow up care instructions if necessary. 
STUDY TIMELINES
An individual  will participate in the study for approximately 5 weeks. It will take 
approximately 1 year to enroll all study participates. The data to complete primary 
analyses is January 2021.
All recruiting  will occur at either Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Arkes Pavilion in the 
outpatient dermatology offices).

Criteria for Evaluation:
Pharm acodynamics:
The primary pharmacodynamic variable w ill be the CFA which measures fat absorption.  Secondary 
pharmacodynamic variables will include the Coefficient of Nitrogen Analysis Absorption (CNA) 
(measuring protein absorption), stool fat content, and stool weight.  Additional exploratory variables will 
include s tool frequency and consistency, di arrhea , abdom inal pain , bloating and fl atulence .
Safety:
The safety variables include:
Clinically significant physical examination findings and laboratory values
Proportion of subjects reporting treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
Statistical Methods:
Pharm acodynamics:
The primary pharmacodynamic variable w ill be the CFA.  The primary pharmacodynamic variable will 
be analyzed in all subjects who complete the [ADDRESS_877897].  From this model, the mean CFA difference betw een two treatment groups will be 
estimated, along with a two -sided 99% confidence interval (CI) that wi ll be compared w ith a non -
inferiority margin of 12%.
The secondary pharmacodynamic variables will be the CNA, stool fat, and stool w eight.  These variables 
will also be analyzed separately using a mixed effects model including sequence, period and treatmen t 
group as fixed effects and subjects within sequence as a random effect.  All comparisons for all 
secondary pharmacodynamic variables between the treatment groups will be descriptive.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be carried out using the safety population.  The safety population includes all 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug at any time during the study.  Treatment -emergent 
AEs and SAEs, including pre -and post -treatment SAEs, will be summarized and reported.
Pharmacodynamic a nd safety analyses will be performed separately for Part 1 and Part 2.

3.0 Introduction
Pancreatic enzy me replacement therapy  (PERT) is the cornerstone of nutritional 
management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency  (EPI ) due to cy stic fibrosis (CF), 
chronic pancreatitis (CP), partial or complete pancreatectomy (PY) or other conditions.  
Without pancreatic enzyme replacement, the patients may suffer from severe s ymptoms of 
maldigestion and malabsorption.
PERT is critical to achieve optimal growth in patients with EPI  [INVESTIGATOR_654351].  In patients with CF, abnormall y thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct in 
the pancreas.  The pancreatic digestive enzymes from acinar cells and bicarbonate from 
ductal cells are not secreted into the intestin e, thus preventing the normal digestion of 
starch, fat and protein.  This results in steatorrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, changes in 
bowel habits and often, failure to thrive.
Pancrelipase Delay ed-Release (DR) capsules is a PERT currently  marketed in U nited 
States as Creon®for the treatment of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220981], CP, PY and other conditions.  
[COMPANY_013] has modernized the current drug product process for manufacturing the enteric 
coated drug product into uniform coated pancrelipase pellets at a new manufacturin g site 
in Cork, I reland.  Part 1 of this study  is being conducted to determine whether the 
modernized process (MP) uniform coated pellets formulation from the large -scale suite 
[pancrelipase DR capsules MP 24,000 USP Units (lipase)] manufactured at the Cor k 
facility  results in similar clinical pharmacody namics and safety  as the current US 
marketed Creon®, and is thus appropriate to be administered for the same indication and 
patient populations as Creon®.
In order to protect CREON's suppl y chain through sit e and geographic diversity , [COMPANY_013] 
invested in new equipment and facility expansion to duplicate the approved Abbott 
Neustadt Active P harmaceutical Ingredient (API)process used to manufacture Creon® 
currentl y marketed in the US, to manufacture pancrelipas e DR capsules at an Alternate
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Site (AAPIS ) in Waunakee, Wisconsin (Scientific 
Protein L aboratories, SPL) .
  The approved source countries of the starting material for the  
Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_877913] 2017 -000578 -12
17
manufacture of pancrelipase is the same for both manufacturing sites.  Part 2 of this study  
is being conducted to determine whether AAPIS 24,000 USP Units (lipase) results in 
similar clinical pharmacody namics and safety  as the current US marketed Creon®, and is 
thus appropriate to be administered for the same indication and patient populations as 
Creon®.
Information on Creon®, the MP formulation and the AAPI S formulation can be found in 
Section 5.5.2.  Further inform ation on pancrelipase DR currently  marketed as Creon®in 
the US can be found in the US Product Information (USPI ).
The dose of stud y drug selected in each Part of this study is based on ~4,000 lipase units 
(LU) per gram fat/day , corresponding to the maximu m dose of Creon®in CF patients as 
per current US label, and according to the upper limit of the US Cy stic Fibrosis 
Consensus Committee.1,[ADDRESS_877914] will consume a predetermined study diet that 
contains 100 gfat/day  and a minimum of 1 g/kg protein/day, under the supervision of a 
registered dietitian.  The study  drug dose will be individualized to this diet for each 
subject.
3.1 Differences Statement
Unlike typi[INVESTIGATOR_654352] y studies previously conducted with Creon®, which 
demonstrated superiorit y to placebo, this study  aims to determine whether the drug 
products tested in each Part [pancrelipase DR capsules MP 24,000 USP Units (lipase) for 
Part 1 or pancrelipase AAPI S 24,000 USP Units (lipase) for Part 2] are non -inferior to the 
current US marketed drug product (Creon®) as measured by  [CONTACT_654382] (CFA).
3.2 Benefits and Risks
All subjects randomized in this study  will receive treatment for EPI [INVESTIGATOR_654353] a 
safe and effective dose.  This is the primary benefit to subjects for this study.  Risks of 
study  participation include those currently  listed in the USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_654354]®, and are not

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
For stud y Part 1 , the target number of evaluable subjects is 22, with a screening of 
approximately  36subjects and enrollment/randomization of approximately  26 subjects to 
meet scientific and regulatory  objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects, 
in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of evaluable 
subjects in Part 1 (22) has completed the study, there is a possibility that additional 
subjects in screening will not be enrolled in that Part.  
For study Part 2, the target num ber of evaluable subjects is 18, with a screening of 
approximately  30subjects and enrollment/randomization of approximately  20 subjects to 
meet scientific and regulatory  objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects, 
in alignment with ethical c onsiderations.  Therefore, if the target number of evaluable 
subjects in Part 2 (18) has completed the study, there is a possibility that additional 
subjects in screening will not be enrolled in that Part.

Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only, with the subjects not wearing shoes.
Body Weight and BMI 
Body weight will be measured, with the subjects in light weight clothing without shoes, at 
the Screening Visit, on Day  1 of the 2 study  drug treatment periods for each study  Part 
and at Visit 3 and 5 preferably  using the same calibrated weighing scale at all visits.  The 
body  weight should be assessed in the morning prior to any  food intake and to any  blood 
sampling.
The body  weight measured at Visit 2 of each Part will serve as the baseline measurement
for clinical assessment during DB Treatment Periods 1 and 2 for that stud y Part.
The BMI will be calculated as follows:  bod y weight (kg)/height2(m).
Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of sitting blood pressure, heart rate and bod y temperature will 
beobtained at the Screening Visit, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit [ADDRESS_877977] will be performed b ydesignated study  site

Initiation of Confinement Periods
Subjects must have a negative viral test (e.g., PCR, antigen) for COVID- 19, from a test 
done within 7 day s prior to each Confinement period (V2 and V4).  The test can be 
performed locall y or via central laboratory, considering availability and whichever may 
provide faster turnaround time, as well as no signs or sy mptoms associated with COVI D-
[ADDRESS_877983] can only  enter the next confinement period if the following criteria are 
met prior to the next dose scheduled confinement:
For symptomatic subjects:
●At least two consecutive COVID- 19 tests, ≥ [ADDRESS_877984] passed since recovery, defined as resolution of fever without use of 
antipy retics andimprovement in respi[INVESTIGATOR_23908] (e.g., cough, shortness

For asymptomatic subjects:
●At least two negative COVID- 19 tests in a row, ≥ [ADDRESS_877985] to 
begin Treatment Period 1 of the other Part (unless directed b y the investigator) if they:
●do not leave the confinement location following completion of the Part they 
were originally  enrolled into and decide to enter the other study  Part directly  
following the original Part, or;
●enter DB Treatment Period [ADDRESS_877986]'s calorie and protein 
requirements will be designed b y a clinical site dietitian for the screening confinement 
period and each of the treatment periods in consultation with each subject before V2 and 
will include food items which the subject prefers so that compliance with the consumption 
requirements is met.
The diet plan must be designed ensuring:
●a total protein intake of a minimu m of 1 g/kg/day;
●a normal to low fiber content;
●a total daily  fat intake of 100 grams.
The fat intake should be distributed proportionally across:
○3 meals with 25 grams fat per meal ( ±3 grams is acceptable, if needed), 
and
○2 snacks with 12.5 grams fat per snack ( ±2 grams is acceptable, if needed),
The subject's individualized diet plan will be implemented by [CONTACT_654387] 2 treatment periods for each study Part (beginning at Visit [ADDRESS_877987] is discharged between the two DB treatment periods), onl y 
after review and approval by  [CONTACT_654388].
The individualized diet plan should be similar for each of the two treatment periods for 
each stud y Part with the same daily amount of fat and pro tein, and the same fat 
distribution across meals and snacks.
A web -based dietary  program (ABVDiet) has been developed b y [COMPANY_013] to track 
nutrition information of foods and beverages, diet plans and subject food consumption.  
ABVDiet will be utilized by  [CONTACT_654389] y subject prior to each confinement period.  ABVDiet is designed to send 
automatic email alerts to the designated individuals and to streamline diet plan approvals 
by [CONTACT_654388], and will also record the amount of food not consumed during 
meals and snacks.  
Assignment of Subject Number and Randomization
The site will access the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system at the Screening 
Visit to obtain a [ADDRESS_877988] throughout Screening, DB Treatment Periods 1 
and 2 for all stud y Parts (if a subject is participating in both Parts) and the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Period.  If the subject is not enrolled into the study , the reason for screen 
failure will be documented in the eCRF and the site will access the I RT sy stem to register 
the subject as a screen failure.
All inclusion/exclusion criteria must be reviewed prior to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/confinement 
at Visit 2 for each stud y Part.  For subjects entering the DB treatment periods, subjects 
who meet all of the eligibility  criteria will be enrolle d to one of the study  Parts and 
randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequence arms on Day  1 of DB Treatment Period 1 
(Visit 2) of the enrolled study  Part by [CONTACT_181452] I RT sy stem and providing the [ADDRESS_877989] number assigned at the Screening Visit ( Visit 1). 
Pancrelipase

DB Treatment Period 1 of the enrolled Part according to a randomization schedule 
generated b y the statistics department at [COMPANY_013] (see Section 5.5.3).   At Visit 4, the site 
will access the IRT s ystem to obtain the [ADDRESS_877991] -Treatment Follow -Up Visit (Visit 6).
Diet Administration and Dietary Records
For each stud y Part the diet will be administered from each confinement period Day 1 
(Visit 2 and Visit 4) until the last stool has been collected (Visit 3 and Visit 5) during each 
of the 2 confinement periods (or 4 confinement periods for subjects partic ipating in both 
Parts).  The subjects must be encouraged to eat all food provided and will not be allowed 
to eat an ything in addition to the 3 meals and 2 snacks provided within the diet plan.  Fat 
or protein containing nutritional supplements (e.g., nutri tional shakes, fish oil 
supplements, omega fatty acids) not included in the diet plan are not allowed to be taken.  
If the stud y diet does not provide sufficient food to prevent hunger, a third snack may be 
consumed b y the subject and the sites will be pro vided with a list of examples of low -
calorie, low- fat foods that subjects may  consume.  The calories and nutrients from these 
foods will not need to be included in the diet plan.  The fat content of this additional snack 
should be ≤ 2 grams/serving and the protein content should be ≤4 grams/serving.
During all study  confinement periods, subjects will be actively  monitored by  [CONTACT_654390].  Subjects must be 
encouraged and instructed to consume all food provided as per the planned diet during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/confinement with specific reference to Days 3, [ADDRESS_877992] 2017 -000578 -12

ABVDiet is designed to calculate the consumed amounts of fat, protein and calories.  The 
proportion of food provided in the diet that is consumed each day  on Day  3 (starting from 
first food intake), Day  4 and Day  5 (ending with last food intake) will be determined and 
recorded in ABVDiet b y specificall y assigned site personnel.  Non- consumed meals, 
snacks and an y other deviations to the die t requirements will be determined and will be 
recorded similarly in ABVDiet.  The preferred method to quantify  the amount of uneaten 
food is by  [CONTACT_654391], as appropriate for the individual solid or liquid food, 
respectivel y.  Thus, food selections i n meals/snacks should be of a t ype which can be 
easily  measured.  The same calibrated food scale should be used for weighing the 
subjects' meals/uneaten food.  The total daily  fat and protein intake will be determined 
from the quantity of food actuall y con sumed and will be recorded in the eCRF.
In the event that not all food in the planned diet is consumed on Days 3, [ADDRESS_877993] when either of the following occur:
●the subject consumes less than 80% of the planned fat consumption, or
● t he difference in fat consumption in the two treatment periods is more than 
10% based on the lower amount consumed.
Human Fecal Elastase
A stool sample for fecal elastase testing will be collected as a pre -screening activity  or

5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements
Since pancrelipase is not a bsorbed from the intestine, there will be no drug concentration 
measurements in this study .
5.3.3 Pharmacody namic Variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Variable
The primary  pharmacod ynamic variable is the CFA measured at the end of each 
confinement period.
The CFA is calculated as 100•[fat intake –fat excretion]/fat intake.
Fat intake will be determined from fat content of food consumed.  Fat excretion will be 
determined from the fat content in the stool(s) collected between the two d ye markers.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary  Variables
The secondary  pharmacody namic variables include:
●CNA, measured at the end of each treatment period.
○The CNA is calculated as 100•[nitrogen intake –nitrogen 
excretion]/nitrogen intake.
○Nitrogen intake will be determined from protein content of food consumed.

The study  Part [ADDRESS_878036] capsules manuf actured with AAPI S, 
24,000 USP Units (L ipase) as compared to Creon®(pancrelipase) DR capsules 
24,000 USP Units (lipase).  Each subject is able to serve as his/her own control, thus 
minimizing the number of subjects exposed to meet the primary  objective.
For both study  Parts, due to the nature of the effects of pancrelipase on fat absorption, and 
the lack of absorption of pancrelipase, there is no concern related to an y carr y over effect 
with immediate rollover between DB Treatment Period 1 and DB Treatment Period 2.  
This interval is not intended as a washout period and an y imbalance in this period length 
would not lead to an y difference on stud y endpoints.  The flexibility  in the duration of the 
interval between the DB treatment period is intended to allow subjects to deal with 
logistical aspects (such as school and work schedules) related to the need for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/confinement during DB treatment, and to allow sites to more effectivel y 
manage their staffing and occupancy .  The same applies to the inte rval between Parts, for 
subjects who elect to participate on both Parts.

Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_878037] measurements used in studies 
assessing the pharmacodynamics and safety  of pancreatic enzy me replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
In studies investigating the efficacy  of pancreatic enzy me supplementation, the commonly  
employ ed and scientifically  accepted primary  endpoint to determine efficacy  is the CFA.  
The CFA reflects fat absorption and is a gauge for the lipase activity in pancreatic enzyme 
supplements on the digestion of dietary  fat.  The CFA endpoint is also appropriate for 
studies that assess pharmacod ynamics endpoints but are not designed to determine 
efficacy  of a compound versus placebo.  The effects on the CFA can be observed even 
after a short treatment period of 3 –[ADDRESS_878038] that subjects will be carefully  observed 
during confinement/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and return immediately  to their usual diet, and the fact 
that the PERT dose during confin ement will be adjusted to the new fat content of the diet, 
the risk of destabilizing their underl ying condition is considered minimal.
It has been previously  shown that an inverse linear correlation exists between the level of 
the remaining endogenous lipa se activity  and the improvement in CFA induced b y 
PERTs.7  The enrollment of subjects with low endogenous lipase activit y (more severe 
disease) may  improve the interpretability  and clinical relevance of on -treatment CFA 
values in PERT trials.
Therefore, in order to select a more severe patient population, the most conservative 
cutoff for fecal elastase -1 of < 15 µg/g was chosen to select subjects with E PI.  Removing 
the requirement for a screening off -PERT CFA < 70% is particularl y relevant, given the 
challenges elicited b y the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The maximum labeled dose of Creon®(4,000 LU/g fat intake/day ) has be en selected for 
this study , and is also applied to the pancrelipase DR MP drug product and the 
pancrelipase DR AAPIS drug product, as the effect of the MP drug product and AAPI S 
drug product is believed to be non -inferior to that of Creon®.  The maximum la beled dose 
is chosen to provide sufficient lipase to adequatel y digest the dietary fat required in the 
study  without exceeding the maximum recommended dose of pancrelipase contained in 
the Cy stic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines.

considered as having "no reasonable pos sibility " of being associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide another cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered 
intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query , observed b y site personnel, or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], 
will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated i n the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, and/or if the investigator con siders them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre planne d prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will b e considered an adverse event.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_878044]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition tha t substantially  interferes 
with the activities of daily living of a stud y subject.  Disability  
is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor 
medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e .g., sprained 
ankle).

medical or surgical intervention to prevent an y of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significant disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth 
is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appro priate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's 
usual activities and may  be incapacitating or life -threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator wi ll use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug: 
Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_878046] a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the adverse event.
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_237421], another cause of event must be provided b y the investigator for the serious adverse 
event.

The anal ysis population swill be defined separately for Part 1 and Part 2.
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population includes all randomized subjects.  Subjects will be 
included in the anal ysis according to the treatment sequence that they  are randomized t o.  
ITT population will be used for summaries of subjects' disposition and baseline 
characteristics.
The Evaluable Set consists of all randomized subjects who complete both treatment 
periods and have 100% stool samples collected for both treatment periods.   Subjects will 
be included in the analy sis according to the stud y drug that they  actuall y received.   The 
Evaluable Set will be used for the efficacy  analy sis for the primary  and secondary  
endpoints. 
Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_878055].  From this model, the mean CFA difference between 
two treatment groups will be estimated, along with its two -sided 99% confidence interval 
(CI) that will be compared with a non-inferior ity margin of 12%.  If theupper bound of 
the99% CIof CFA difference (Creon®-Pancrelipase DR MPin Part 1, or Creon®-
Pancrelipase DR AAPI [INVESTIGATOR_654369] 2) rules out the margin, the non -inferiority  of the 
Pancrelipase product investigated in that Part to C reon® will be declared.
The two -sided 95% CI for the estimate of the mean CFA difference will also be provided.  
The primary  estimand and specified estimand attributes for each stud y Part will be 
described in the SAP.  Supplementary  analy ses for the primar y endpoint will be described 
in the SAP.
The secondary  pharmacody namic variables will be the CNA, stool fat, and stool weight.  
These variables will also be anal yzed separatel y using a mixed effects model including 
sequence, period and treatment group as f ixed effects and subjects within sequence as a 
random effect.  From this model, an estimate of the treatment difference along with its 
two-sided 95% CI will be derived.  All comparisons for all secondary  pharmacody namic 
variables between the treatment grou ps will be descriptive.
Additional exploratory  pharmacod ynamic variables include stool frequency , stool 
consistency , diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence .  These variables will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_2070].

occur during the administration of OL Creon®will be summarized separately  for events 
that happen during the screening period and after randomization.  The number and percent 
of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulated b y system organ class (SOC) and Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA®) preferred term.  In addition, 
summary  of AEs by  [CONTACT_654397].  Serious 
AEs, or AEs that lead to premature study discontinuation will be listed and described in 
detail.  All these summaries will be done by  [CONTACT_1570].  Mean change in vital signs 
and laboratory  variables at each visit will be summar ized.  The last evaluation prior to the 
firstdose of DB study  drug in the corresponding treatment period will be used as baseline 
for the analy sis in that treatment period.  A frequency  table will be presented for 
Potentially  Clinicall y Important (PCI) vi tal sign findings.  Shift tables for laboratory 
variables will be presented according to the reference ranges (low, normal or high).
Due to the small number of subjects per treatment group, onl y summary statistics will be 
applied to all the safet y paramete rs.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
8.2.1 Non- inferiority Margin Justification
The selection of a non -inferiorit y margin of 12% for the CFA is based on historical 
placebo- controlled Creon®Study  S245.3.126, which had a similar study  design 
(two-period, two -sequence cross -over) as Study  M16 -111, and enrolled 31 CF subjects 
with confirmed EPI [INVESTIGATOR_654370] a historical CFA < 70%, or current  
Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_878057] 2017 -000578 -12
80
or historical fecal elastase -1 < 50 µg/g.  The effect of Creon®compared to placebo in 
CFA was estimated a s 39.02% (95% CI:  32.3% –45.8%).  However, it is expected that 
the current study  will enroll subjects with more severe EPI [INVESTIGATOR_654371] S245.3.126, as the enrollment criteria for EPI  [INVESTIGATOR_654372] y is more stringent: 
subjects need to have a baseline fecal elastase less than 15 µg/g to be enrolled.  Therefore, 
the non -inferiorit y margin for comparing Pancrelipase DR MP to Creon®(Part 1) or 
comparing Pancrelipase DR AAPI S to Creon®(Part 2) should be derived based on 
Creon's effect in a more comparable subject population in the historical study .  At the time 
of the writing of this amendment, all subjects enrolled in Study  M16 -111 had a screening 
FE-1 of less than 15 µg/g and a screening CFA below 50%.
A subgroup anal yses in Study  S245.3. [ADDRESS_878058] 
in subjects with a more severe EPI , defined as having a CFA of 50% or less during the 
placebo treatment period (since the screening FE -1 value was not collected in 
Study S245.3.126).  The Creon effect com pared to placebo in CFA was estimated as 
52.25% (95% CI:  47.0% – 57.5%) in this subject population.  Based on the lower bound 
of the 95% CI for the estimate of Creon effect, a non -inferiority margin of 12% would 
preserve over 70% of that effect ((47 -12)/4 7=74%).
8.2.2 Sample Size Determination
For each stud y Part, it is assumed that the expected difference in means of CFA between 
Creon®and Pancrelipase DR MP (Part 1) 
orbetween Creon®and Pancrelipase DR AAPIS
(Part 2) is 0.  For Part 1, with 22 subjects comple
ting the 2 crossover treatment periods 
and having valid CFA in both periods, the power to claim non-inferiorit y is approximately  
96% based on one -sided ty pe I error of 0.005 (i.e., based on two -sided 99% CI  for non -
inferiority  assessment), assuming a stand
ard deviation (SD) of 12% for the within -subject 
treatment difference . 
For Part 2, with 18 subjects completing the 2 crossover treatment periods and having valid 
CFA in both periods, the power to claim non -inferiority  is approximately  98% based on 
one-sided type I error of 0.005 (i.e., based on two -sided 99% CI  for non -inferiority   
Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_878059] 2017 -000578 -12
81
assessment), assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 10% for the within -subject treatment 
difference (see Section 8.2.3). 
Table 3. Study Power for Non -Inferiority in Primary Endpoint of CFA
SD of Treatm ent Difference Power (N=22) Power (N=18)

10% 99% 98%
12% 96% 89%
14% 87% 75%
Note: Power for non -inferiority in primary endpoint by [CONTACT_654398], if true CFA difference is 0.
It is expected that a screening failure rate of about 30% will be observed and that 
approximately  10-15% of the subjects will drop out during the crossover treatment 
periods.  Based on these assumptions, approximately [ADDRESS_878060] 18 subjects to complete 
the crossover treatment periods.
8.2.3 Blinded Sample Size Re -Estimation (BSSR)
For Part 1, with a sample size of [ADDRESS_878061] treatment difference in CFA is 12%.  For Part 2, 
with a sample size of [ADDRESS_878062] treatment difference in CFA is 10% .  However, if the actual SD 
for a respective stud y Part is larger than the assumed SD (12% or 10% for Part 1 or Part 2, 
respectivel y), the power for that study Part may be insufficient.  In order to ensure the 
assumption of SD holds for the study , a blind edreview and estimate of the SD will be 
conducted for each study Part when the CFA data from the two treatment periods for 
approximately  half of the planned subjects are available.  If the estimate of the SD is 
much different from the assumed SD, the sample size of the study  may  be adjusted based  
Pancrelipase
M16 -[ADDRESS_878063] treatment difference in CFA from 
Part 1 was approximately 7%.  Per the BSSR plan specified in the SAP, the Part 1 sample 
size remains the same as 22 evaluable subjects.  However, the assumption of the SD used 
in the Part 2 sample size determination has been adjusted to 10%.
8.3 Study Data Reporting
If one stud y Part (Part 1 or Part 2) is completed earlier than the other study Part, the 
database lock and formal unblinded anal ysis for the completed study  Part will be 
performed.  Anal ysis of one Part will not unblind the other.  The [COMPANY_013] study team will 
review the efficacy  and safet y results from the unblinded anal ysis of the completed Part 
and an interim study  report for the corresponding study  Part may  be prepared for 
regulatory  submissio n.
8.4 Randomization Methods

Fractional laser assisted steroid therapy vs intralesional steroids in the treatment of 
keloids  
 
****************************************************************************** *********** **********  
 
 
1. Abstract :   
The purpose  of this study is to compare  the effects of fractional CO [ADDRESS_636210] treatment for keloids. However , more 
effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494605].  Ablative fractional laser (AFL) treatment facilitates delivery of 
intralesional  steroid more  deeply  and uniformly  into the skin by [CONTACT_494620]. Recent studies  
have showed that fractional laser assisted steroid therapy can be effective in the treatment of keloids.[ADDRESS_636211] of intralesional 
steroids.  
 
2. Objectives:  
Primary objective: To compare  fractional CO [ADDRESS_636212] of intralesional steroids for the treatment of keloids.  
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, curr ent experience with procedures,  
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Keloids are a form of aberrant scar formation usually at the site of healing skin injury.  They present 
clinically as firm, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_494606] y nodules that are usually very distressing to 
patients and are often a source of both physical and psychological morbidity.  During the normal wound 
healing process, extracellular matrix consisting of Collagen I or III are deposited by [CONTACT_494621] a 
defect. The extracellular matrix also is constantly being broken down and remodeled with the help of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs). With keloids, there is a poorly understood excessive deposition of scar tissue 
during this wound healing process re sulting in firm, irregularly shaped, fibrous, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194] , or even 
rope-like nodules.1,2,[ADDRESS_636213] become part of the mainstay 
of treatment include massage therapy, pressure garments, adhesive tapes, silicone gel sheets, intralesional 
corticosteroids, topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], and surgical resection. Poorly investigated treatment options  include 
use of cryotherapy, radiotherapy, intralesional 5 -fluorouracil and bleomycin, imiquimod 5% cream, and 
Tranilast.1,[ADDRESS_636214] for soft tissue vaporization.  CO 2 laser beam heats and vaporizes the skin 
tissue, instantly removing the superficial layers of the  skin. E ach fractional micro -spot creates a thermal zone.

A recent study published in April 2015 in Dermatologic Therapy assessed the ablative erbium laser 
in fractionated mode, combined with topi[INVESTIGATOR_494608]. It was performed in the laser center of the Department of Dermatology (University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494609], 
[LOCATION_009]), from January [ADDRESS_636216] -line of 
treatment. A 2940 -nm ablative fractional erb ium laser was used and topi[INVESTIGATOR_494610] a day under occlusion with transparent film dressings. A total of 23 patients with 70 keloids were 
treated and the median percentage of improvement was 50% (range -43 to 84).[ADDRESS_636217] of the laser -assisted delivery of steroids for treating keloids scars and the authors admit that a 
prospective comparative evaluation is warranted.  
 
We hypothesize that  laser assisted intralesional  steroid therapy will be superior  to intralesional 
steroid  alone  in the treatment of keloids. We also hypothesize that treatment with laser assisted intralesional  
steroid therapy will give a more uniform treatment result since the re are  more even amounts of steroid spread 
throughout the treat ment site wi th the laser assisted steroid method.  
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence a nd timing of study procedures:  
 
In order to be eligible for the clinical study, subjects must have been seen in the dermatology clinic 
at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494611] (CTReP) research studies.  Interested study participants will be evaluated 
after their routine clinical care visits.  Participants will als o be recruited from other Johns Hopkins patient 
populations via the use of fliers.  Study procedures will be conducted at the CTReP office located at the Johns 
Hopkins Outpatient Center. Recruitment may include Johns Hopkins University employees or student s, but 
these populations will not be specifically targeted for recruitment.   Interested individuals will be interviewed 
to ensure they meet basic criteria for participation.     
 
We will enroll up to 40 subjects in this study . 
Power calculation: an n of approximately 33  would be needed to obtain statistical power at the 
recommended .80 level (assuming a 50% improvement expected in the keloids treated with intral esional 
injections plus laser vs a 25% improvement in the keloids treated with intralesional in jections alone) .   
 
During the first visit, the expected timeline will be discussed.  We will also discuss in detail the laser 
procedure and expectations with regards to healing time and symptoms in the post -procedure period.  We 
will attempt to answer all  questions to the subject’s satisfaction. If  the subject is agreeable, documentation 
will be obtained of their consent to participate in the study and the subject’s agreement to be contact[CONTACT_494622].  After  informed consent is obtain ed, subjects  who are currently receiving 
treatment for their keloids  will undergo a washout period of 4 weeks . 
 
Once this washout period has elapsed, subjects will return to the study site to undergo baseline 
procedures.  Patients with more than one keloid on the trunk or back would be selected for participation in the 
trial. Two keloids of comparative size and texture located on the same general anatomic location (trunk or

 back) would be selected for intervention on each p atient. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_172746] c compound  with EMLA  or 
tetracaine 24%/ lidocaine 7%  will be applied to both keloids using standard protocol . One lesion would be 
treated with fractional CO2 ablative laser followed with intralesional triamcinolone  acetonide  at 4 w eeks 
intervals while the other lesion would be treated with intralesional triamcinolone  acetonide  alone  at 4 week 
intervals . Patient would be treated 4 times with each treatment modality  for a total of 16 weeks.  Digital 
photographs may be obtained at each study visit . The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) 
would be used to evaluate each treated lesion prior to and at completion of the treatment duration . 
Measurement of keloid size and thickness will be also be performed prior to and at completion of the 
treatment duration. Each patient will serve as his or her own control, as we will compare the keloid treated 
with the laser assisted steroid therapy to the  keloid  treated with ILK  alone .   
 
Laser treatment : During the treatment visit, topi[INVESTIGATOR_494612] 7%/lidocaine 23 % will be 
applied to the both treatment site s and after sufficient anesthesia is attained, one keloid  will be treated with 
the fractional CO2 laser using standard protocol as practiced in our clinics  followed by [CONTACT_494623] .  
  
Photography: Standardized digital photographs will be obtained by [CONTACT_129179] a digital camera and 
software under standard photographic conditions.  Photograph files will be coded to remove personal 
identifiers and stored on a secure hard drive in CTReP.  
 
Clinical assessment: Clinical assessments will be performed to 1) recor d baseline skin findings, 2) assess 
treatment progre ss prior to each subsequent treatment  3) and assess results at the end of the study    
The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale : The POSAS includes subjective symptoms of pain and 
pruritus and expands on the objective data captured in the V ancouver Scar Scale . It consists of 2 numerical 
scales: The Patient Scar Assessment Scale and the Observer Scar Assessment Scale. It assesses vascularity, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area, and it incorporates patient assessments of pain,  
itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and relief.  The POSAS has been applied to postsurgical scars and used in 
the evaluation of linear scars following breast cancer surgery, demonstrating internal consistency and 
interobserver reliability when compared t o the VSS with the added benefit of capturing the patients' ratings .[ADDRESS_636218] s.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_636219] has a known allergy or sensitivity to any local anesthetic drug (e.g. EMLA  or tetra caine 
7%/lidocaine  23%) or a local antiseptic planned to be used for the laser . 
8. The subject is in an exclusion period from a previous study or is participating in another clinical trial  
9. The subject is an adult under guardianship or is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42868] a public or private institution, or is 
deprived of freedom  
10. The subject is unable to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator due to language problems, 
poor mental development, or impaired cerebral function  
 
6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
EMLA cream  or tetracaine 7%/  lidocaine 23 % is the topi[INVESTIGATOR_494616]. There will not be a separate 
batch of this drug for the sole purposes of this study as the purpose of this stu dy is unrelated to the use of the 
drug and is unlikely to interfere with study results.    
 
EMLA cream (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is an emulsion in which the oil phase is eutectic 
of lidocaine and prilocaine in a ratio of 1:[ADDRESS_636220] settings on the eCO 2 Plus 
laser system, Lutronic Inc.  The Lutronic eCO 2 Plus laser system will be obtained by [CONTACT_494626].  
 
Intralesional triamcinolone acetoni de (Kenalog)  will be used in the study . 
   
7. Study Statistics  
The data collected in this study will be used to inform the design of future study related to the use of laser 
therapie s for keloids . 
 
8. Risks  
There are risks associated with ablative laser therapy.  The most common local side effects are 
discomfort during the procedure, temporary swelling, acute sensitivity to sun exposure, increased sensitivity 
to use of cosmetic products and erythema.  There i s also an associated risk of both hyper - and 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_494617].   There is risk that the laser could make the keloid larger. 
This is unlikely but if this was to happen, laser treatment on this lesion would be discontinued and  only 
intralesional keloid would be used from that point on. Finally, there is a risk of eye injury related to the CO 2 
laser therapy.  Exposure to the invisible carbon dioxide laser beam (10,600 nm) can cause damage to the 
cornea or sclera.  For this reaso n, the operator, participant and all other parties within the secured treatment 
room will wear protective eyewear provided by [CONTACT_494627].   The provided eyewear has wrap -around shields , 
meets ANSI/ISEA   Z87.1 -2003 standards, and offers protection from CO 2 lasers  (10,600 nm).  
 
Other potential  complications of this treatment are infection, activation of herpetic lesions, and scar 
formation.   Preventative measures are taken to minimize these risks .  Standard precau tions will be taken using 
the same protocol used in our clinics for patients undergoing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494618].    Caution and

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_636221] benefit to the participant as a result of this study.  In theory, the 
participant  may enjoy keloid improvement with both the laser assisted steroid therapy as well as the 
intralesional steroid therapy.  This, however, cannot be guaranteed.   
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
Participants will not be paid for this study  
 
11. Costs  
All other costs will be covered by [CONTACT_494628] .

Preventing Loss of 
Independence 
Through Exercise 
(PLIÉ) in Persons 
With Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI)  
Document Date: February 11, 2015 
 
Data Analysis 
Characteristics of Group 1 and Group 2 were compared using t-tests for continuous variables and Chi-
square tests for categorical variables. Means were calculated for all outcome measures at each of the 
three time points (baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks) by [CONTACT_19313] (PLIÉ vs. UC). Our primary outcome was the 
‘between-group’ effect size from baseline to 18 weeks, which was defined as the change in Group 1 
(PLIÉ) minus change in Group 2 (UC) divided by [CONTACT_499543] (SD). Signs were 
reversed for measures in which lower scores reflected better outcomes, so that positive values indicate 
greater improvement with PLIÉ and negative values reflect greater improvement with UC. Only those who 
completed assessments at both time points were included in calculations. An effect size of ≥ 0.25 SDs 
was defined as ‘clinically meaningful’ based on prior studies of effect sizes for current dementia 
medications.[ 5] 
Although there are no well-accepted criteria for defining an effect size as clinically meaningful, an effect 
size ≥0.[ADDRESS_933888] size ≥0.[ADDRESS_933889] size ≥0.80 is considered large.[ 48] To capi[INVESTIGATOR_688414]-over design, we also calculated 
‘within-group’ effect sizes for both groups, which were defined as change during PLIÉ minus change 
during UC divided by [CONTACT_688433]. Thus, for Group 1 (PLIÉ first), the within-group effect size was 
calculated as change from baseline to 18 weeks minus change from 18 to 36 weeks divided by [CONTACT_688434], whereas for Group 2 (UC first), the within-group effect size was calculated as change from 18 to 36 
weeks minus change from baseline to 18 weeks divided by [CONTACT_688433].

12.0    Background  
  
12.1 Background:  
 
The dementia epi[INVESTIGATOR_688419]. The number of people with Alzheimer‘ s disease 
and other dementias in the [LOCATION_002] is currently more than 5 million, and a new 
person develops the disease every 72 seconds (1). By 2050, it is anticipated that [ADDRESS_933900] developed dementia, resulting in a total of 1 1 to 16 
million cases. The costs of this epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] —both economically and in terms of the 
suffering of affected individuals and their loved ones —will make dementia one of the 
top health issues facing the nation.  
  
The progressive loss of independence is one of the most difficult aspects of Alzheimer‘s 
disease for both affected individuals and caregivers. We have previously found that 
dependence in one or more basic daily activities is a key predictor of placement in a 
long-term care facility (2). Current drug  treatments are associated with small 
improvements in cognitive function but have minimal impact on important outcomes 
such as independence (3).  
  
A handful of small  studies have found that exercise interventions improve physical and 
cognitive function in healthy elders (4) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment 
(5). However, surprisingly few studies have examined the effects of exercise in 
individuals with mild to moderate -stage Alzheimer‘s disease (6), particularly  as a  
method for maintaining ind ependence. Exercise programs based on Eastern traditions, 
such as Yoga and Tai Chi, have shown encouraging results for physical and emotional 
functioning in the elderly, and improvements in older patients with various chronic 
conditions, including cardiova scular disease (7).   They have rarely been studied in 
patients with dementia, however.   
  
The goal of our study is to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test an integrative exercise program 
specifically designed to help older adults with mild -to-moderate dementia maintain 
independence and function. This program will include traditional strength -building 
exercises targeting the muscles required for basic daily activities as well as elements of 
Tai Chi, Feldenkrais and yoga.   
 
 
 
 
12.2 Preliminary studies:  
 
Prior Experience of the Research Team . The research team has previously 
performed a wide range of RCTs of non -pharmacological interventions in a variety of 
study populations and settings including in individuals with cognitive deficits.  
[CONTACT_688470],  Associate Professor of Psychiatry (effective 7/1/2011) at UCSF, 
will be PI. [CONTACT_668468] is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_688420]. 
She has recently completed an RCT of computer -based mental activity in individuals 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as the Mental Activity and eXercise (MAX) 
Trial—an Alzheimer‘s Association -funded study of the effects of physical and mental 
activity on cognitive function in sedentary elders with cognitive complaints.  
[CONTACT_688471] tine Yaffe , Professor of Psychiatry, Neurology and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]/Biostatistics at 
UCSF, will serve as a Co -Investigator. [CONTACT_688467] is an internationally renowned expert 
in cognitive impairment and dementia. She has been PI [INVESTIGATOR_688421] -pharmacologic 
interventions.  
[CONTACT_676729] , Professor of Medicine and Director of the Osher Center for 
Integra tive Medicine at UCSF, will serve as Co -Investigator. [CONTACT_453269] was Deputy 
Director of the National Center of Complimentary and Alternative Medicine at the 
National Institutes of Health for five years (2003 -2008) and has extensive knowledge 
of alternativ e approaches to health and well -being.

facilities for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
IOA staff will determine initial eligibility (e.g., primary participant age, diagnosis,  
English language fluency, ability to walk) and will contact [CONTACT_688440]. A letter will then be sent to caregivers 
of potential participants describing the study and providing an opportunity to learn 
more by [CONTACT_47184] a form, calling the research study or talking with IOA staff. Thos e 
caregivers who express interest will be contact[CONTACT_688441]/eligibility and to schedule a consent visit.  
2. Informed consent . As described in more detail below, primary participants and 
caregivers will particip ate in the consent process together. The consent forms will be 
reviewed and capacity to consent will be assessed in primary participants based on 
responses to questions to determine level of understanding of study procedures, risks, 
benefits and rights. Pa rticipants who do not demonstrate capacity to consent will be 
asked to assent to study procedures and caregivers will be asked to consent on their 
behalf. After the consent process has been completed, the Mini -Mental State Exam will 
be administered to prim ary participants to assess level of cognitive impairment. 
Consent procedures will take place at IOA unless otherwise requested by [CONTACT_50633].  
3a. Phase 1: Beta -test. Two to 4 participant/caregiver dyads will participate in 
refining the exercise protocol. W e have developed PLIÉ in consultation with experts 
worldwide who have experience performing different types of exercises in individuals 
with mild -to-moderate dementia, including traditional strength -building exercises, 
yoga, Tai Chi and Feldenkrais. Specif ically, we have identified exercises from each of 
these traditions that engage the muscles most needed to maintain independence --
including lower body strength (to help with getting out of bed/chair), balance (to 
minimize risk of falls), upper body strength  (to help with lifting), fine motor exercises 
(to help with activities such as eating and brushing teeth), and pelvic floor exercises 
(to help with continence) --and we have combined them into a unique integrative 
exercise program. These exercises are desig ned to be purposeful (i.e., to achieve a 
goal) and to build procedural (‗muscle‘) memory. In addition, breathing and guided 
meditation exercises are included to promote relaxation and well -being.  
Because we are combining these exercises in a new way, we fe el that it is important 
for us to beta -test and refine the program in a small group of subjects prior to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -
testing it in a larger group. The primary goal of the beta -testing phase will be to 
identify a core group of exercises that target the key muscle s and movements required 
to maintain functional independence that are safe, fun and meaningful to the 
participants as well as variations of these exercises to accomodate differences in 
baseline functional ability of participants. Classes will occur 2 -3 day s/week for 30 -45 
minutes for 8 weeks. Caregivers will be invited to attend 1 class per month, but this 
will be optional.  
3b. Phase 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test. Participant/caregiver dyads who do not participate in beta -
testing will be invited to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_688423]. These subjects will be randomly 
assigned to either Group 1 (intervention), which will participate first, or Group 2 
(waitlist control group). Group 1 will participate in the PLIÉ program 2 -3 days/week for 
30-45 minutes for 18 weeks while Group 2 eng ages in their usual activities at the day 
care center, which includes a brief daily chair -based exercise session. After Group 1 
has completed their training, Group 2 will participate in the PLIÉ program 2 -3 
days/week for [ADDRESS_933904] measures in all participants and caregivers. In the beta -testing group, 
assessments will occur at ba seline and after the 8 -week training period and will 
primarily be utilized to assess feasibility and logistics of data collection procedures. In 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-testing group , assessments will be performed at baseline, 18 weeks and 36 
weeks in all participants. Separate appointments will be made for primary participants 
and caregivers to maximize the validity of data collected (e.g., to ensure that 
caregivers do not 'help' primary participants with answers to questions and feel 
comfortable providing information a bout issues such as difficult behaviors or levels of 
stress). Assessments will take place at IOA unless otherwise requested by [CONTACT_50633].  
4a. Primary participants . 
Cognitive function will be assessed with the Alzheimer‘s Disease Assessment Scale 
– Cogniti ve Subscale (ADAS -cog) (Rosen 1984), which is the most commonly used 
primary outcome measure in AD treatment trials. It is an [ADDRESS_933905] assessment of learning (word list), naming (objects), following commands, 
constructional Praxi s (figure copying), ideational Praxis (mailing a letter), orientation 
(person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions.  
Physical performance will be assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB) , which was developed  by [CONTACT_688442]. The test 
includes repeated chair stands, tandem balance testing and 8‘ walking speed (Guralnik 
1994) .  
  
Fall-related self -efficacy  will be assessed with the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) , which 
is a 10 -item scale that has been validated in individuals with cognitive impairment 
(Hauer 2010).  
  
Quality of life will be assessed with the Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer‘s Disease 
(QOL-AD), which is a brief, 13 -item measure that obtains input from both the 
individual and the caregiver (Logsdon 1999). Scores may range from 13 -52 points.  
  
Functional health and well -being will be assessed with the SF-36v2, which 
assesses function in eight dom ains and provides physical and mental component 
summary scores that may range from 0 to 70 (Stewart 1989). The SF -36v2 is typi[INVESTIGATOR_688424]. However, we also will ask caregivers to answer 
questions on behalf of participants an d will compare their answers to assess 
congruence. Data collected will help to determine if this measure is suitable for a 
larger trial.  
4b. Caregivers . 
Participant's physical function will be assessed with the Alzheimer‘ s Disease 
Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS -ADL) scale (Galasko 1997). The 
ADCS -ADL is a [ADDRESS_933906] ional 
status in AD treatment trials.  
Participant's dementia -related behaviors will be assessed with the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) , which is a [ADDRESS_933907] on caregiver distress (Cummings 1997).  
  
Participant's falls will be assessed based on caregiver report of number of falls in 
the previous 8 weeks (beta -testing group) or 18 weeks (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing groups).   
  
Participant's quali ty of life will be assessed with the Quality of Life Scale in 
Alzheimer‘s Disease (QOL -AD), which is a brief, 13 -item measure that obtains input 
from both the individual and the caregiver (Logsdon 1999). Scores may range from 
13-52 points.  
  
Participant an d caregiver functional health and well -being will be assessed 
with the SF-36v2, which assesses function in eight domains and provides physical and 
mental component summary scores that may range from 0 to 70 (Stewart 1989). The 
SF-36v2 is typi[INVESTIGATOR_688425]. However, we also will ask 
caregivers to answer questions on behalf of participants and will compare their 
answers to assess congruence.   
  
Caregiver burden will be assessed with the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) , 
which is  a 96-point scale that includes 24 items and 5 domains (Novak 1989).  
  
5. Goal -setting.  
  
Prior to beginning PLIÉ, participants and caregivers will talk with the exercise 
instructor to discuss which daily activities are most meaningful to them and to 
determine whether there are any specific goals related to physical function or daily 
activities that they would like to achieve. The exercise instructor will use this 
information to target exercises toward these goals during training if possible. 
Discussions wi ll be in person with the participant and may be in person or by [CONTACT_688443].  
6. Compliance and adverse events . Compliance will be assessed based on class 
attendance. Bi -weekly check -in calls will be performed with caregivers to assess for 
adverse events and to address issues related to non -compliance.

the rights and welfare of participants:  
 
The safety and welfare of study participants will be ensured by [CONTACT_688444], where they are already attending an adult day care program. 
Study personnel who assess for eligibility, obtain consent and administer study 
question naires will be extensively trained in how to work with individuals with mild -to-
moderate dementia and caregivers in a sensitive and respectful manner. Class size will 
be limited to [ADDRESS_933911] one type of exercise training and will be 
extensively trained in how to safely work with individuals with mild -to-moderate 
dementia. Data will be maintained on secure servers or in locked file cabinets.

○ No   
● Not applicable   
 
 
  
 
17.2 * Is there a standard of care (SOC) or usual care that  would be offered to  prospective 
subjects  at UCSF (or the study site) if they did not participate:  
 
● Yes ○ No  
If yes, describe the SOC or usual care that  patients would receive if they choose not to 
participate:  
The adult day health program at IOA currently includes approximately [ADDRESS_933912] control group.  
 
 
  
 
17.3 Describe other alternatives to study participation that are available to prospective 
subjects:  
 
Subjects could ask their physicians to suggest other exercise programs or could 
engage in similar exercises on their own at home. They also could choose not to 
participate.  
 
 
  
  
18.0    Risks and Benefits  
  
18.1 * Risks and discomforts:  
 
As with any program involving new exercises, primary participants may experience 
injuries including muscle strain or soreness, joint pain or fall -related injuries. In 
addition, primary participants or caregivers may find the baseline or follow -up 
assessmen ts to be stressful. Loss to privacy may occur if information is released 
outside the study team.  
 
 
  
 
18.2 Steps taken to minimize risks to subjects:  
 
We have consulted with a wide range of experts who have experience leading exercise 
classes  for individuals with mild -to-moderate dementia to ensure that the PLIE 
exercise program is safe and likely to be effective. These include local, national and 
intern ational experts in traditional exercise programs as well as Tai Chi, Feldenkrais, 
and yoga. We will minimize stress during baseline and post -intervention assessments 
by [CONTACT_688445] (e.g., taking breaks, rescheduling appointment, skippi[INVESTIGATOR_688426]). We will minimize risk of loss of privacy by 
[CONTACT_688446] a secure manner and not to discuss study 
partic ipants outside the research team.  
 
 
  
 
18.3 Benefits to subjects:  
 
● Yes ○ No  
If yes, describe:  
Some primary participants may experience improvements in physical, emotional or 
cognitive function or sleep, but this is not guaranteed.  
 
 
  
 
18.4 Benefits to society:  
 
 We anticipate that findings from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_688427] a larger study 
that will determine the efficacy of PLIE for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_688428] -to-moderate 
dementia maintain function and independence. If this program is successful, it c ould 
substantially improve quality of life for individuals with dementia and their caregivers.  
 
 
  
 
18.5 Explain why the risks to subjects are reasonable:   
 
The risks to subjects are comparable to daily life experiences related to engaging in 
physical activity or in being assessed in a clinical setting.  
 
 
  
  
19.0    Confidentiality and  Privacy  
  
19.1 Plans for maintaining privacy in the research setting:

19.9 This study will  be issued  a Certificate of Confidentiality:  
 
○ Yes ●  No  
 
  
  
20.0    Subjects  
  
20.1 Check all  types of subjects that may be enrolled:  
 
□ Inpatients  
□ Outpatients  
■ Healthy volunteers  
□ Staff of UCSF or affiliated institutions  
 
 
  
 
20.2 Additional vulnerable populations:  
 
□ Children  
□ Subjects unable to consent for themselves  
□ Subjects unable to consent for themselves (emergency setting)  
■ Subjects with diminished capacity to consent  
□ Subjects unable to read, speak or understand English  
□ Pregnant women  
□ Fetuses  
□ Neonates  
□ Prisoners  
□ Economically or educationally disadvantaged persons  
□ Investigators‘ staff  
□ Students  
 
Explain why it is appropriate to include the  types of subjects  checked above in this 
particular study:  
The goal of the study is to determine whether the PLIE exercise program enables 
individuals with mild -to-moderate dementia to maintain functional s tatus and 
independence. Therefore, although study participants will have a diminished capacity 
to provide consent, findings from the study could potentially improve quality of life 
for some study participants and provide important data for  others with mild -to-
moderate dementia.  
 
Describe  the additional  safeguards that have been included in the study to protect the 
rights and welfare of these subjects and minimize coercion or undue influence:  
Informed consent will be obtained from study participants and their caregivers  
 together. Capacity to consent will be determined using a standard protocol that is 
based on the protocol used at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center. Subjects who are 
able to conse nt for themselves will do so. Subjects who do not demonstrate capacity to 
consent will be asked for assent and caregivers will provide consent on their behalf.  
 
 
 
  
21.0    Recruitment  
  
21.1 * Methods (check all that apply):  
 
□ Study investigators (and/or affiliated nurses or staff) recruit their own patients 
directly in person or by [CONTACT_648].  
□ Study investigators recruit their own patients by [CONTACT_31711]. Attach the letter for review.  
□ Study investigators send a ―Dear Doctor‖ letter to colleagues asking for referrals of 
eligible patients. If interested, the patient will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_688431] (with documented permission from the patient). Investigators 
may give the referring physicians a study information sheet for the patients.  
□ Study investigators provide their colleagues with a ―Dear Patient‖ letter d escribing 
the study. This letter can be signed by [CONTACT_688447]. The study investigators may not 
have access to patient names and addresses for mailing  
□ Advertisements, no tices, and/or media used to recruit subjects. Interested subjects

■ Other  
 
If Other , explain:  
As described in the Procedures section, IOA staff will assess initial eligibility based on 
factors such as the primary participant's age, diagnosis and ability to walk 
independently. Caregivers of potentially eligible subjects will be contact[CONTACT_688453] f 
either in person or by [CONTACT_688454] a letter in the mail. Study investigators will then mail a 
letter to caregivers describing the study and providing an opportunity to participate by 
[CONTACT_47184] a form, calling the research office or telling IOA staff.  
 
 
  
 
21.2 * How, when, and by [CONTACT_190182]:  
 
Initial eligibility (age, dementia diagnosis, English language fluency, ability to walk 
independently) will be determined by [CONTACT_688455]. Caregivers who express interest will be  
 contact[CONTACT_688456].  Those meet 
initial criteria will be scheduled for an appointment to obtain written consent and to 
assess other eligiblity criteria (mild -to-moderate stage disease based on Mini -Mental 
State Exam score).  
 
 
 
 
21.3 * How, when, where and by [CONTACT_688457]:  
 
Please see above.  
 
 
  
 
21.4 * Protected health information (PHI) will be accessed prior to obtaining consent:  
 
● Yes ○ No  
 
  
  
22.0    Waiver of Consent/Authorization  for Recruitment 
Purposes  
(Note: This section partially replaces the old "Request for Waiver of 
Consent/Authorization for Minimal Risk Research or for Screening for 
Recruitment"  supplement form. Please do not  attach the old form to 
this application.)  
  
This section is now required when study investigators (and/or 
affiliated nurses or staff)  recruit their own patients directly.  
  
22.1 * Study personnel need to access protected health information (PHI) during the 
recruitment process and it is not practicable to obtain informed consent until potential 
subjects have been identified:  
 
● Yes  
 
If no, a waiver of consent/authorization is  NOT needed.  
 
  
 
22.2 *  A waiver for screening of health records to identify potential subjects poses no more 
than minimal risk to privacy for participants:  
 
● Yes  
 
If no, a waiver of authorization can NOT be granted.  
 
  
 
22.3 * Screening health records prior  to obtaining consent will not adversely affect subjects' 
rights and welfare:  
 
● Yes  
 
If no, a waiver of authorization can NOT be granted.

22.5 * Describe any health information that will be collected prior to obtaining informed 
consent:  
 
During the telephone screening process, we will collect data to assess initial eligibility 
criteria including diagnoses of exclusionary medical conditions or contraindications to 
exercise.  
 
Note: HIPAA requires that you collect the minimum necessary.  
 
  
 
22.6 * Describe your plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with 
the research  or provide a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers, or 
indicate and explain that retention is required by [CONTACT_2371]:  
 
PHI for individuals who decline to participate will be retained to ensure that these 
individuals are not contact[CONTACT_688458].  
 
 
  
  
23.0    Informed Consent  
  
23.1 * Methods (check all that apply):  
 
■ Signed consent will be obtained from subjects and/or parents (if subjects are 
minors)  
□ Verbal consent will be obtained from subjects using an information sheet or script  
□ Electronic consent will be obtained from subjects via the web or email  
□ Implied consent will be obtained via mail, the web or email  
■ Signed consent will be obtained from surrogates  
□ Emergency waiver of consent is being requested for subjects unable to provide 
consent  
□ Informed consent will not be obtained  
 
 
  
 
23.2 * Process for obtaining informed consent:  
 
 The participant and caregiver will sit together with research staff during the consent 
process. Research staff will review the key points of the consent documents and will 
ask if the participant or caregiver have any questions. Research staff will then ask  
questions of the participant to assess capacity to consent.   The assessment form is 
included for review. If the participant demonstrates capacity to consent, they will sign 
the consent form; if not, they will be informed that the caregiver is being asked to sign 
on their behalf, and the participant will be asked to assent to study procedures. 
Because caregivers also will be actively participating in the study (by [CONTACT_688459], stress, etc.), they will sign a separat e 
consent form. Finally, research staff will sign both forms and will indicate that an 
assent discussion was completed if appropriate.  
 
 
  
 
23.3 * How investigators will make sure subjects understand the information provided to 
them:  
 
Research staff will ask participants a series of yes/no questions to assess whether 
consent information was understood. The wording of the questions will be varied to 
ensure that participants cannot simply answer yes or no to all questions. Information 
not understood will be discussed again and understanding will be reassessed. If 
participants are unable to answer any questions after two discussions, they will be 
considered unable to provide consent and will be asked to assent to study procedures 
by [CONTACT_688460] g to have their caregiver provide consent on their behalf. Participants who

24.0    Surrogate Consent  
(Note: This section partially replaces the old "Surrogate 
Consent"  supplement form. Please do not  attach the old form to this 
application.)  
  
24.[ADDRESS_933915] or mental health facility, or on psychiatric 
hold:  
 
● No  
 
If yes, use of  surrogate consent for research is NOT allowed in [LOCATION_004].  
 
  
 
24.2 This study is related to the cognitive impairment, lack of capacity, or serious or life -
threatening diseases and conditions of the research subjects:   
 
● Yes  
 
If no, use of surrogate consent for research is NOT allowed in [LOCATION_004].  
 
  
 
24.3 Explain why use  of surrogates is necessary for completion of  this study:  
 
Purpose of the study is to develop an exercise program that will help to delay loss of 
independence in individuals with mild to moderate dementia.   Consequently, due to 
the nature and purpose of the study, it is likely that some participants may have lost 
their capacity for decision making.   A surrogate may be necessary for multiple 
reasons:   A) to be able to provided consent should it be determined that the study 
participant does not have the capacity to make decisions and B) to provide reliable 
informatio n regarding the participant‘s current level of functioning including mental 
and physical functioning, relevant to the study and C) to provide information on 
caregiver burden resulting from the loss of independence of the participant.  
 
 
  
 
24.4 Plans for assessing the decision -making capacity of prospective subjects:  
 
1. Attempts will be made to obtain informed consent directly from the subject.  
2. To ensure the subject has the capacity to consent and is able to directly 
consent, decision making capacity will be assessed by [CONTACT_688461].  
3. Subject‘s decision making capacity will be assessed by [CONTACT_688462]. Observations made will 
be used to assess the subject‘s ability:  
1. to make and state a decision and  
2. to understand the study objectives, in particular the potential 
participant‘s ability to express his/her ow n understanding and 
rationale for decisions involving:  
 The nature of the research and relevant information including 
time in the study and procedures.  
 Consequences of not participating in the study  
 Alternatives to participation  
4. A Capacity Assessment Record for PLIÉ participants will be used to record the 
capacity to consent and will be kept with the research chart.  
5. Should the investigator determine the subject lacks decision making capacity, 
the investigator will inform the parti cipant and seek surrogate consent.  
6. Surrogate will then be asked to fill out the Self -Certification of Surrogate 
Decision Maker form.   The form will be kept in the participant‘s research chart.  
7. Consent form will be reviewed again with surrogate and particip ant. 
8. Consent will be obtained from surrogate  
9. Assent will be obtained from participant  
10. Should the participant not assent, the participant will be excluded from the 
study despi[INVESTIGATOR_593910]‘s consent.  
 
 
  
 
24.5 Plans for obtaining consent from subjects who regain ability to consent after a surrogate 
has given initial consent:  
 
Dementia progression is typi[INVESTIGATOR_688432] 6 to 
12 months. Because our study is low -risk and relatively brief (8 -36 weeks), we will not 
reassess capacity to consent in participants. However, a subject's resistance or  
objection to engaging in study procedures at any point will be taken as evidence of 
refusal or withdrawal.   
 
 
  
 
24.6 Requirements for any study involving surrogates for obtaining informed consent.  Check 
to acknowledge:  
 
■ Research takes place in [LOCATION_004]. All surrogates will complete the ―Self -
Certification of Surrogate Decision Makers for Participation in Research‖ form.  
■ Conscious subjects will be notified of the decision to contact a surrogate. If subjects 
object  to study participation, they will be excluded even if their surrogate has given 
consent.  
■ Surrogates will not receive any financial compensation for providing consent.  
■ If a higher -ranking surrogate is identified at any time, the investigators will defer to 
the higher -ranking surrogate‘s decision regarding the subject‘s participation in the 
research.  
 
For research taking place outside of [LOCATION_004], explain how investi gators will confirm 
that surrogates are legally authorized representatives:

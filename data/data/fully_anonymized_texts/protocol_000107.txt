[ADDRESS_1140832] for individuals  and society . Researchers  hypothesize 
that the development  of these conditions  is due to survivors  having  a higher  risk of motor  impairment  because 

5 
 
 
 of exposure to vincristine.  Vincristine  is a chemotherapeutic  agent  used  in a multi- drug regimen to treat 
pediatric , adolescent  and young adult  (AYA)  cancers,  particularly  acute lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  and 
Lymphoblastic  lymphoma  (LL).  
Exposure to vincristine  during the first four weeks  of treatment  induces  clinically  significant  neuropathy  in 78% 
of children5. The trajectory  for children with intermediate to severe neuropathy  peak s around week  14 5. All 
forms  of neuropathy , sensory,  motor,  and autonomic  can arise  in children and adolescents ; however,  motor  
deficits  are the most  frequent  and can persist  into adulthood6. With the increase in use of multi- drug 
chemotherapy,  survival  of children with ALL and LL has reached between 80% - 90%7,8. Thus,  the health 
impact  of VIPN  in adult  survivors  of pediatric  cancer  is now becoming apparent.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_822619] 80% - 90% survival  rate, there  are no effective  treatments or interventions  for vincristine -
induced peripheral  neuropathy  (VIPN)  and one is urgently  needed . Our long- term goal is to develop and 
implement  interventions  to minimize  the persistent  effects  of VIPN.  The proposed study  will assess the 
feasibility  of exercise  (EX) as a therapeutic  intervention for pediatric  patients  with ALL and LL who have  
clinically  significant  VIPN.  The EX component  will be a mix of aerobic,  dynamic  resistance  and isometric  
exercises.  Emerging data support the notion that e xercise protects against chemotherapy -induced peripheral 
neuropathy (CIPN)9 and may help repair damaged nerves after CIPN develops10. Specifically, exercise  
increases many molecular signals, such as nerve growth factor  (NGF), growth associated protein 43 (GAP 43)  
and synapsin (SNAP1) , which induce axonal repair in peripheral nerves11. Exercise  also decreases levels of 
serum chemerin12, a pro- inflammatory protein and genetic marker associated with VIPN in children. The 
primary objective of this study is to assess the feasib ility as well as determine preliminary effect size estimates 
of EX in preparation for a fully powered efficacy trial. Forty children and AYA (ages 5-25 years) who are on 
treatment for ALL or LL and exhibit  a total neuropathy score of [ADDRESS_1140833]’s total neuropathy and quality of life, will be measured at baseline (T1) and following the 8- week 
study (T2). Our study will address the following specific aims:  
Aim 1 : Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of EX as an interventi on for VIPN in pediatric patients with 
ALL and LL   
Hypothesis  1: Subjects will  complete > 50% of the EX sessions during the 8- week intervention.  
Hypothesis 2:  Children, AYA  and parents will report satisfaction with the intervention and its components.  
 
Aim 2: Estimate preliminary effect sizes of the EX intervention.   
Hypothesis 1: The EX intervention will lead to improved VIPN (lower TNS -PV scores) at the end of the 
intervention T2 (14 weeks: primary endpoint) compared to baseline T1 (6 weeks)  
Hypothesis 2: The EX intervention will lead to improved secondary outcomes  of VIPN (lower P -CIN scores), 
Neuropathic pain (lower NPS and CTCAE scores), Quality of Life (higher P eds QL V4 scores) , and P hysical 
activity  (higher total activity time, more time with higher heart rate throughout the day, more exercises 
completed, and higher oxygen consumption)  for patients at the end of the intervention (T2) compared to 
baseline (T1).  
Hypothesis 3:  The EX intervention will lead to increases in Biomarkers  of NGF, SNAP1, GAP 43, and  PDGF -
BB and Chemerin at the end of the intervention (T2) compared to baseline (T1).  
Hypothesis 4:   Changes in key predictor variables (e.g. self -efficacy, o utcome expectations, support) will be 
associated with changes in outcomes (e.g. neuropathy, pain, and quality of life).  
 
C. BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
Vincristine -induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN ) 
[ADDRESS_1140834] diagnosed pediatric cancer (ages 0- 19) is leuke mia (26%) with acute lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL) 
being the most common (75%) 7, while  lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) is  a fast-growing type of Non-Hodgkins  
Lymphoma ( NHL)  accounting for 2% of  all NHLs13. Patients  with both ALL and LL receive Vincristine  as part 
of their standard treatment  plan utilizing  the same  treatment  and dosing schedule13. 
Due to improved multidrug treatment regimens over the past 40 years, the 5- year survival rate for these 
children has increased from 57% to 80% - 90% 7,14. However, due to vincristine exposure, we know that 
approximately 78% of the children with ALL will develop severe  peripheral  neuropathy (Vincristine -
induced peripheral neuropathy: VIPN)5. To date there is no study on children with LL. VIPN is observed very 
early in treatment, usually within the first four weeks 15. The development of VIPN  is characterized by 
[CONTACT_544447], sensory and autonomic loss of function and usually results in dose reductions of vincristine 
during treatment and thus an overall loss of therapeutic efficacy 16-18. While we know that methotr exate, 
another che motherapeutic agent used in the treatment of ALL,  can also have toxic effects, severe  neuropathy 
induced by [CONTACT_822633] (<1%) and manifests as a reversible optic neuropathy not a peripheral 
neuropathy19,[ADDRESS_1140835]  one chronic  condition (70%),  but also at least  one severe  or life-threatening condition (>40%)  in 
adulthood25,26.  To have  increased risk to anyone of these conditions  in adulthood is a major  medical  burden to 
the individual  as well as society.   
Metabolism of vincristine and association with neuropathy  
[CONTACT_822659]’s laboratory has been conducting research focused on VIPN in the pediatric population for more 
than a decade,  and she is considered one of the leading experts in this field. Her research team has 
significantly moved this field forward by [CONTACT_822634]3A5 enzyme as compared to CYP3A4 
27,28 and that the CYP3A5*1 allele, which is responsible for the fully 
functioning enzyme, is more prevalent in the African American population as compared to Caucasians 29,30. 
Furthermore, they revealed severity of VIPN is significantly worse in the Caucasian children without CYP3A5*[ADDRESS_1140836] validated a modified version of the T otal Neuropathy Score specifically for pediatric patients receiving 
vincristine TNS -PV
5. The benefit of this version is its sensitivity to change over time (15 weeks) and feasible for 
use in children > 6 years of age.  
Potential biomarkers associated with VIPN  
A recent genome wide associati on study conducted in our laboratory revealed two significant single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) in a large cohort of pediatric patients with ALL. One SNP, rs10454966 is part of the 
COCH gene and is associated with progressive hearing loss and vestibular imbalance 31,32. Two studies of 
pediatric cancer survivors found hearing loss to be more prevalent in survivors as compared to controls 26,33, 
7 
 
 
 suggesting the COCH gene SNP as a potential indicator of future hearing loss. The second SNP, rs7963521 is 
associated with plasma/serum levels of Chemerin 34. Chemerin, a prot ein, is processed from its 
preprochemerin form and can be involved in angiogenesis 35, adipogenesis 36, osteoblastogenesis 37 or 
inflammatory processes 38-40 pathways affected by [CONTACT_11553]. Recently, one study identified chemerin 
levels as an independent predictor for 5- year mortality in patients with gastric cancer 41. Given our preliminary 
findings it is important to investigate further into Chemerin as a novel target for und erstanding neuropathy, a 
potential biomarker for dosing vincristine during treatment and as an indicator of long- term consequences of 
treatment.  
Our research team has discovered two other potential biomarkers, Platelet Derived Growth Factor BB (PDGF -
BB) a nd Interleukin 13 (IL- 13)42. Utilizing blood samples from pediatric ALL patient s, [CONTACT_822659] discovered 
PDGF -BB levels were negatively associated with worse peripheral neuropathy, while IL- 13 was positively 
associated with it. The study proposed in this application is going to verify the preliminary data found for these 
biomarkers . 
Following peripheral nerve injury many neurotrophins and proteins are expressed to aid in the nerve repair 
process. In addition to the biomarkers found in our research study , PDGF -BB and IL -13, we will also measure 
three markers of neuronal repair: nerve growth factor (NGF), synapsin 1 (SNAP1), and growth associated 
protein 43 (GAP43). Molteni and colleagues (2004) demonstrated in a rodent  model of nerve crush injury that 
rodents which exercised also displayed enhanced regrowth of axons that were associat ed with increased 
levels of NGF, GAP43, and SNAP111. There is also extensive evidence on the positive effects of exercise on 
sensory nerves and neuropathic pain. Cooper et al (2016) recently published a review on this topic  discussing 
the mechanisms underlying exercise and explaining the role of the NGF, SNAP1, and GAP43 in the repair 
process10. 
Exercise for pediatric neuropathy  
Currently, there are only a few prevention and treatment studies in children and AYA  with chemotherapy 
induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and they all utilize pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_822620]. These clinical trials have used carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] –  showing a small effect 
43, oral glutamic acid –  mixed results 44,45, and 
pyridoxine and pyridostigmine –  beneficial in i solated cases 46. Even when searching ex tensive journal 
databases with broad terms such as, physical therapy interventions in pediatric pat ients with CIPN, no results 
are found 47. Although there is no evidence in the pediatric population, there is some data in the adult 
population  to support exercise as an intervention for CIPN . In a randomized trial with 314 adults experiencing 
CIPN,  – 6 weeks of walking and resistance training –  induced a significant decrease in neuropathy as 
compared to usual care 48. A second s maller study examined [ADDRESS_1140837] not been studied 
at all in the pediatric population, even though t he National Comprehensive Cancer Network set forth clinical 
practice guidelines  in oncology for survivors regarding healthy lifestyle habits in 201451, with a major 
emphasis on exercise.  
 
D. INNOVATION  
Our trial has several innovative features including: (1) The only pediatric trial to develop a non-
pharmacological  VIPN intervention; (2) Estimating effect sizes for a subsequent fully -powered efficacy trial of a 
non-pharmacological approach for VIPN ; and (3) Including biomarkers as a secondary  outcome measure to 
predict severity of VIPN.

E. CONCEPTUAL MODEL  
 
 
Social Learning Theory (SLT)  developed by [CONTACT_347131] [ADDRESS_1140838] a strong influence on each other and that it is the interaction of these 
constructs that underlie the model . 
The key constructs of SLT relevant to this study are described below:  
Self-efficacy : Self-efficacy is the belief an individual possesses regarding their ability to influence the events of 
their lives54. A person with high self -efficacy is more likely to complete a challenge or try again should they not 
succeed. Studies have consistently shown an increase in EX  participation as self -efficacy increases55,56, as 
well as increases in self -efficacy as EX  participation increases57. Two of the main sources of self -efficacy are 
mastery (performance) ex periences and vicarious experiences.  When a person successfully carries out a task, 
he or she will believe that they have the capabi lities necessary to repeat the behavior (i.e., mastery 
experiences).  
Support:  Social support is the perception one is cared for and has  the necessary  assistance from others in 
his/her  social network. Support can arise from any person in the individual’s s ocial network, such as parent, 
sibling, physician, or peers. There is evidence showing the total physical activity metabolic equivalents (PA Mets) of pediatric cancer survivors are positively correlated with mother, father, and sibling total PA Mets
58. 

[ADDRESS_1140839] on PA as a result of family and peer interactions; however, 
they also demonstrated an indirect effect of support: an increase in self -efficacy59. We are also including 
physicians and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_822621]. 
Calfas and colleagues found that physicians who add just 3– [ADDRESS_1140840] a health educator to call for a few minute “booster” 2 weeks later were able to increase sedentary patient’s PA by 37 min per week in patients compared to a control group with no intervention
60.   
Outcome expectations : Outcome expectatio ns are the underlying beliefs  an individual has about the likelihood 
and value of the consequences of their behavior61. These expectations motivate individuals to engage in 
behaviors in order to achieve the desired outcome.  Individuals who expect exercise to improve their health are 
more likely to engage in exercise and to endorse positive health outcomes as a result.  
 
Theory of the Exercise Intervention 
Education:  Education involves increasing health- related knowledge and teaching participants about the 
benefits of exercise.  Education is expected to motivate patients to engage in exercise and increase 
expectations that their VIPN, health, and quality of life will improve as a result of their engagement in exercise.  
Cancer  survivors report that they are more willing to participate in physical activity if their Healthcare Providers 
recommend it62. Education may help to diminish the overly cautious approach of caregivers,  which has been 
acknowledged a s one of the limiting factors of physical activity participation63.  
Self-Monitoring: Self-monitoring is being aware of and tracking one’s own behavior.  Self -monitoring improves 
engagement in physical activity and enhances self -efficacy for physical activity.  Wearing an activity tracker 
and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_822622] -monitoring that have frequently been used in previous exercise 
research.  There is an exercise study which shows that children wearing Fitbits use them to self -regulate and 
as a result increase their activity levels as shown by [CONTACT_822635]64. It also allows patients 
to determine if they are reaching their health- related goals.   
Goal Setting:  Goal setting motivates individuals to improve their health and quality of life.  Better performance 
is observed when individuals set goals that are spec ific and challenging and when individuals were provided 
feedback support regarding their progress to their goal65. In our study, the exercise therapi[INVESTIGATOR_822623].  We expect that setting goals will 
help patients to remain motivated and increase self -efficacy for exercise.  
Planning:  Planning requires the individual to develop an action plan to reach their goals. This involves 
identifying times and locations for exercise, identifying potential barriers to exercise participation, and problem -
solving with the exercise therapi[INVESTIGATOR_822624].  Planning improves the likelihood that patients will reach the exercise goals that they set and, in turn, will enhance self -efficacy
66.  
Reinforcement:  Reinforcement is a process that encourages a specific behavior to reoccur over time. We will 
use one- on-one meetings with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], Fitbit trackers, and parents/family to reinforce participants to engage 
in exercise. This will provide multiple opportunities for encouragement and positive feedback. Reinforcement is expected to enhance sel f-efficacy, which, in turn, will motivate participants to engage in exercise. There is 
evidence to suggest that in addition to parental support, peer support can be reinforcing 
67, thus we will use the 
exercise videos with the age appropriate peers as a form of reinforcement.  
Observational learning:  Obser vational learning is a change in one’s behavior as a result of that individual being 
exposed, either through interpersonal interaction or media, to a specific behavior, particularly by [CONTACT_822636]61. Observing someone similar to you achieve success on a similar task can increase self -efficacy. 
Thus, we will use similar -aged children and AYA  to demonstrate the EXs on each video in order to support 
observational learning and enhance self -efficacy for exercise.   
 
10 
 
 
  
 
Biological Theory of VIPN  
Exercise:   EX increases oxygen to all organ systems, including the nervous system 10. Emerging data support 
the notion that EX protects against chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and may help repair 
damaged nerves after CIPN develops. Exact EX prescriptions have not yet been developed, but the more 
hours spent in moderate- to-vigorous activity, the less peripheral neuropathy experienced68.  
Oxygenation:  The increase in oxygen which occurs during exercise (both aerobic and resistance)  has been 
shown to increase NGF69, SNAP170, and GAP [ADDRESS_1140841] that increases Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), thus helpi[INVESTIGATOR_822625]71. 
Myelin is important for nerve conduction and is targeted during chemotherapy72, thus maintaining healthy 
myelin sheaths around the axons is necessary to minimize neuropathy.  
Biomarkers:  We have selected three key factors, NGF, SNAP1 and GAP [ADDRESS_1140842] exercise to decrease this cytokine.  
Quality  of Life:  Childhood and AYA cancer has a considerable negative effect on a child’s physical wellbeing 
due to chemotherapy, radiation and the resultant side effects of each.  Improving the symptoms that result from 
cancer treatment (e.g., VIPN) and decreasi ng symptom burden is related to improved quality of life in this 
population. Further,  exercise has been shown to improve both muscle weakness and low cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_106387]74 for childhood and AYA cancer survivors , which may also improve their quality of life.

G. PATIENT RECRUITMENT  
Potential subjects will be recruited from the Riley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7722] (Riley)  and IU North Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Riley 
medicine doctors are dedicated to the care of pediatric, adolescent and young adults ages 1- 25. Study 
personnel will work with the clinicians in the Riley Department of Hematology Oncology to obtain the names of 
patients who have diagnoses of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)  or Non-  Hodgkin’s Lymphoma-  
lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) and are planning to undergo vincristine treatment. Patients will be recruited 
during their first 4 weeks of vincristine treatment.  
Potential minor subjects  and their parents/legal guardians may be approached by [CONTACT_380986]/or study 
personnel with information about this study .  Patients and their parents/legal guardians who are interested in 
participating in the study will undergo the informed consent  process. Informed consent will be only obtained by 
[CONTACT_822637].  Patients and their parents/legal guardians may be 
given a study flyer with contact [CONTACT_822638].    
After consent, eligibility will be verified by a member of the study team and the patient will be registered (i.e., 
enrolled) to this study. The original, signed, IRB -approved Informed Consent Document and all regulatory files 
will be maintained by [CONTACT_822639] (PCTO). Applicable regulatory documents must be 
completed and on file prior to registration of any subjects.  
H. RESEARCH DESIGN  
This is a multi- center  study to test the feasibility of pediatric  and AYA  patient adherence to a single intervention 
(exercise: EX) during the consolidation phase of vincristine treatment for A cute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or 
[ADDRESS_1140844] 34 children and AYA  
who will complete the 14 week time point (assuming a 15% attrition rate based on this population).  This study 
is sufficiently powered to detect a .5 SD difference in TNS -PV at the 14 week time point with 80% power bas ed 
on a paired t -test with type I error set at .05. In a previous study of TPN -VS (Smith et al.) assessments from 
children with high severity VIPN resulted in TNS -PV of (n = 165 assessments from 14 children, mean = 8.02, 
SD = 5.22), for middle severity (n = 559 assessments from 70 children, mean = 4.22, SD = 3.01), and for low severity TNS -PV (n = 342 assessments from 25 children, mean = 1.94, SD = 1.86).  Based on a pooled SD = 
3.[ADDRESS_1140845] if our intervention is able to move 
them to low severity.  Additionally, in pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (unpublished) TNS -PV at baseline (1 month) was 3.36 with SD 
= 3.66.  With [ADDRESS_1140846] 80% power to detect a 2 point change in TNS -PV (which is 
considered clinically meaningful) assuming a SD = 3.[ADDRESS_1140847] with type I error set at .05.  For FACES  (range 0 to 5) , based on Smith et al, we 
estimate the pooled SD =.[ADDRESS_1140848] statistically 
significant differences in these outcomes in the proposed study, estimated means and SDs can be used for 
planning larger studies in the future.   
 
 
H.2 Fitbit  tracker justification  
The Fitbit  activity tracker was chosen for this feasibility study due to its versatility and effectiveness within 
younger populations of children. The FitBit’s  ease of use, comfort, design and feedback features were important 
factors for  all age groups (children and AYA ). Researchers in some studies utilized the Fitbit activity tracker  to 
assess adherence to home- based activity programs75.  
I. PROCEDURES

program.  
All study visits will take place before or after routine clinic visits so that patients and their families do not have to 
make additional trips to the four hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129372] . EX sessions  will be completed by [CONTACT_822640].  
I.2 Intervention timeline  
 
 
 
I.3 Exercise (EX) Intervention  
The EX intervention will include both an in-person exercise schedule and at -home video EX sessions  (See 
Appendi x I and II) .  The EX intervention will be designed a nd led by [CONTACT_822641] (Athletics and Fitness 
Association of America) certified physical fitness trainer with fifteen years’ experience and a professional with a 
PhD in an Exercise Science related field.

 In-Person Exercise Sessions : 
The first session will be completed at one of the four hospi[INVESTIGATOR_822626].  Patients will check -in with their intervention specialist during routine visits to one of the sites or 
phone on weeks 8, 10, and 12 at a minimum  throughout consolidation treatment , or once per week if they 
choose (weeks 7 -15). In-person sessions will last approximately [ADDRESS_1140853] to provide reinforcement  
for the patient’s progress.   
If the patient or the study team are unable to meet in person the intervention specialist will contact [CONTACT_822642] (phone call, email, Skype). These sessions will follow the format of the in-
person sessions. Education, assessment of difficulty level, set exercise goals and plan will all be discussed 
during the remote check -in.  
Home Exer cise Sessions : 
At baseline, participants will have access to the exercise videos via the study website or they will be 
downloaded to the study tablet , with 3 chapters of EX sessions  to be completed at home with video instruction.  
Patients will be asked to complete home EX sessions 6 times per week for 8 weeks (week 6 through week 13) during the consolidation phase of treatment.  A Daily Exercise Log is available to record exercise c hapters, 
fatigue level and time of day exercised (See Appendix III).  Patients may choose their rest day each week. Each 
EX session will last approximately [ADDRESS_1140854] and three children 
and AYA  who are of similar  age to the patients demonstrate the exercises. This design is critical for supporting 
the observational learning component of the intervention.  Two videos will be available for the study: one for 
ages 5 –  10; one for ages 11 –  25.  
The EX intervention includes both Resistance Training and Aerobic Training. Each patient will receive an EX 
video with three chapters of Resistance Training and three chapters of Aerobic Training.  Resistance Training 
is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build st rength, endurance, and size to the muscles involved. 
It also strengthens joints involved within the skeletal system. A beginner chapter, an intermediate chapter, and 
an advanced chapter will be designed for patients to have the option to advance as their bodies become more 
or less conditioned.  Beginner level EXs will be a whole- body seated muscle fatigue chapter, the intermediate 
EXs will be a whole- body Thera- band bridge chapter, and the advanced chapter will be a whole- body 
calisthenics chapter.  
The thr ee Aerobic Training chapters will be similar in design to the Resistance Training chapters. Aerobic 
Training is various sustained exercises that stimulate and strengthen the heart and lungs, thereby [CONTACT_822643]’s utilization of oxygen. A beginning c hapter, an intermediate chapter and an advanced chapter will be 
designed. The beginning Aerobics Training chapter will be a seated program for the least conditioned patients. 
The intermediate chapter will be a bridge chapter for those patients where more s trenuous aerobic training can 
be incorporated, and the advanced chapter will be a whole- body aerobics training chapter (consisting of a 
variety of gross motor movements; often rhythmical without equipment or apparatus) for patients with the most 
conditioned overall major muscle groups who can safely participate in whole- body aerobic training against 
gravity.  
Each EX chapter will be designed with three core, three lower body, and three upper body EXs. Each EX 
within a chapter will last fifty seconds for a total of ten minutes for the EX portion of each chapter. An additional 
two and a half minutes of warm -up and cool -down at the beginning and end of each session will total one 
fifteen minute session (See Appendix I for EX schedule).  The EX intervention is designed for patients to 
15 
 
 
 gradually progress through the different EX chapters.  Thus, patients can start at a level (e.g., chair EXs) that 
will likely be within their capabilities and provide a sense of accomplishment.  
Each EX chapter will EX muscle groups in the following order: 1) lower body EXs, 2) upper body EXs and, 
3) core strengthening EXs. Each muscle group will follow the order of largest muscle group to smallest 
muscle group. The EX chapters will follow a Recovery Program format in which larger muscle groups are 
exercised before smaller muscle groups to prevent fatigue and optimize adherence. The Whole- Body 
Recovery Program will ensure that the weakest or the most deconditioned muscle groups will have the 
chance to become reconditioned as all muscle groups (agonist and antagonist) are utilized. Engaging all 
major muscle groups simultaneously will strengthen all joints involved.  
I.4 Demographic and Clinical Data Collection/Measures  
Demographic and Medical Information 
Demographic data obtained at time of consent  will include race, age,  gender, ethnicity, and pre- diagnosis  
exercise level prior to diagnosis . We will use age and baseline exercise level  as covariates. Exercise levels will 
be determined by [CONTACT_822644][INVESTIGATOR_822627] 5- [ADDRESS_1140855] it on the physical assessment form. The categories will be as follows: 
below recommended level of activity, at recommended level of activity, and above recommended level of 
activity.  All medical information (dates and doses of vincristine) will be collected by [CONTACT_822645]’s  medical records.  
Vincristine -induced Peripheral Neuropathy   
Total Neuropathy Score -  Pediatric Vincristine (TNS -PV): The TNS -PV is a multidimensional instrument that 
will be used to measure peripheral neuropathy symptoms and signs in children from 5- 25 years old receiving 
vincristine. Modified from the original Pediatric Total Neuropathy Score (Ped- TNS)5, the instrument assesses 
proximal extension of numb ness, tingling, and neuropathic pain, vibration and temperature sensation, strength, 
tendon refl exes, constipation (autonomic neuropathy), and hoarseness/voice (cranial nerve neuropathy) 77. A 
multiplex ed measuring system was developed that simultaneously ranks the 8- 10 subjective and objective 
parameters. These parameters provide qualitative information on symptoms, nerve conduction and sensory 
tests on a scale of 0 for ‘none’ to 4 for ‘severe’. The individual scores are added together to provide a single 
measure of neuropathy called a Total Neuropathy Score (See Appendix I V).  
Total Neuropathy Score –  Clinical Evaluation (TNS c): The best acknowledged method to assess the severity 
and changes in chemotherapy -induced peripheral neurotoxicity is through determination of the Total 
Neuropathy Score. The TNSc is an instrument that  will be used to measure peripheral neuropathy symptoms 
and signs in young adults from 19- 25 years old receiving vincristine. The TNSc (See Appendix V) consists of 
seven  items with scores correlating significantly with the National Cancer Institute- Common Toxicity Criteria v. 
2.0  ( p < 0.001, r2 = 0.77, r  = 0.88, 95% confidence limits 0.849– 0.914). With a test -retest coefficient of 0.86-
0.87 ( Academy of Oncologic Physical Therapy ). The TNSc is more sensitive than the NCI -CTC 2.0 in detecting 
mild sensory da mage because it detected changes in the range of 1– 3 points even in 50% of those patients 
who were scored as unchanged using the NCI -CTC 2.0 score78.  
 
Pediatric Chemotherapy -Induced Neuropathy (P -CIN) Survey:  the Pediatric Chemotherapy -Induced 
Neuropathy Survey (P -CIN) is a self -report measure of pain for ages 5- 17. The P -CIN is designed to rate 
symptoms of CIPN (numbness, tingling and pain over the past 2 -3 days). The P -CIN consists of 1 3 items for 
ages 5- 17. Each of the 12 items is rated using the 6- point Faces Pain Scale (See Appendix V III). 
Neuropathic Pain  
16 
 
 
 Pediatric Neuropathic Pain Scal e (NPS) -  Five:  The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) was designed to assess the 
distinct pain qualities associated with neuropathic pain.  The NPS consists of 5 items which are rated on a scale 
of 0 to 10 (0="no pain" to 10= "severe pain"). Each question examines an individual aspect of pain and is 
measured independently15. The rating scale is based on the Faces Pain Rating Scale –  Revised (FPS -R) 
which is a self -report measure of pain intensity that was developed for children79 (See Appendi x VII and V III). 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.02:  This scale grades adverse events 
occurring after che motherapy in cancer patients and expl ores the quality of  life (QOL) findings among post 
therapy cancer patients. The NCI CTCAE is a descriptive terminology that can be utilized for pain (Appendix 
IX) reporting and is required to be completed for all cancer  studies80. 
 
Quality of Life   
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0):  The PedsQL is a modular approach to measuring health-
related quality of life in healthy children and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The PedsQL 
integrates generic core scales and disease- specific modules into one measurement system (Appendix X). The 
23-item PedsQL generic core scales and disease- specific scales were designed to measure the core 
dimensions of health as delineated by t he World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning.  For 
the purpose of this study, we will only be utilizing the generic core scales section of the inventory. This measure is tailored to 5 different age groups: toddlers (2- 4); children (5– 7); children (8- 12); teens (13- 18); and 
young adults (18- 2). The Child and Parent Reports (ages 5- 7), Children (ages 8- 12) and Teens (ages 13- 18) 
are made up of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions: Physical functioning; Emotional functioning; Social 
functioni ng, and School functioning. Patient participants will complete the child- report questionnaire, and their 
parents will complete the parent -report version (See Appendix X ). 
Ferrans & Powers Quality of Life Index: Total quality of life will be measured using the Ferrans and Powers 
Quality of Life Index Version III and is a 66- question index designed to evaluate social, psychological, family, 
and health satisfaction (See Appendix XI). This assessment is valid for ages 19  and above. Higher scores 
indicate greater satisfaction in quality of life with an internal Cronbach's alpha of 0.9381. 
 
Social Learning Theory Questionnaire   
Self-Efficacy:  There is currently no exercis e self -efficacy scale for children and AYA’s  with cancer.  We have 
adapted the Bartholomew physical activity self -efficacy scale for children and AYA’s  for use in our study82 We 
have ad apted the original self -efficacy scale by [CONTACT_822646]. Responses to the questions are limited 
to Yes/No and not applicable. (See Section 1 Appendix X II). 
Support:   The support module was taken from a larger validated scale developed by [CONTACT_761770] (2014) which 
measures physical activity self -efficacy, enjoyment, and exercise social support for children83. The support 
section of the questionnaire consis ts of 10 questions rated on a 5 point scale from None to Very often. The 
items assess support children and AYA’s  receive from parents and peers to facilitate exercise. We have 
adapted the term physical activity to the term exercise for this study (See Sect ion 2 Appendix X II). 
Outcome Expectations:  We adapted an existing exercise outcomes expectations questionnaire from the adult 
literature for the purposes of our study.  The survey consists of 10 items targeting exercise outcome 
expectations.  Patients are asked to rate each item on a 5 point scale.  Items were edited for developmental 
level/appropriateness84. (See Section 3 Appendix X II) 
Physiological Parameters  
17 
 
 
 Fitbit  activity tracker:  All patients will be instructed to wear their Fitbit  activity trackers every da y during waking 
hours throughout the intervention period. The Fitbit  activity tracker (specifically the Charge 2) has a five -day 
battery life and an “always -on” heart rate tracking system. It is an accelerometer that is worn like a small 
wristband and records data on movement (steps,  HR, distance and activity ), total activ ity minutes, heart rate 
and total minutes of inactivity including sleep. The data is stored on the device and then can be downloaded 
wirelessly to a computer 75. 
An integral component of wearable activity trackers, such as Fitbit , is the  automation of real -time physical 
exercise tracking and heart rate 85. The Fitbit  activity tracker  builds upon pedometer -based activity 
interventions with a more sophisticated interface using the Internet or a mobile application. This allows for the 
implementation of behavioral change techniques, tailoring of goals, tracking of progress and documenting 
adherence to home- based EX protocol with minimal use of resources 85,86. There is an exercise study which 
shows that children wearing Fitbits use them to self -regulate and as a result increase their activity levels as 
shown by [CONTACT_822635]64. 
Even though the EX  sessions are not purely aerobic EX , the Fitbit  can detect increases in heart rate during 
these sessions. Specifically, the EX  sessions include aerobic EX , dynamic resistance training, and isometric 
EXs and thus, will rely on both aerobic and anaerobic energy sources. During aerobic components of the 
program, the heart must do more work to pump an increased cardiac output to working muscles, and heart rate 
generally increases in a linear fashion to increases in EX  intensity.  Heart rate increases during dynamic 
resistance EX will be due initially to vagal withdrawa l and then stimulation of sympathetic nervous system by 
[CONTACT_822647]. During isometric EX , muscle fibers 
compress small blood vessels, preventing new oxygen- laden blood from reaching affected muscle tissue.  
Thus, as long as the muscle contraction is maintained, heart rate will steadily rise. Therefore,  detectable 
elevations in heart rate are ex pected during EX  sessions, albeit through several different mechanisms. 
Although the immediate effect of isometric exer cises is to inhibit blood flow and therefore oxygen to the 
muscles, the long- term effects are vasodilation, thus an increase in oxygen. In addition, isometric exercises 
help maintain strength of the muscles and enhance stabilization. These types of exercis es are often included in 
rehabilitation situations and therefore can contribute to improving neuropathy87.  
 
Six Minute Walk Test: The Six - minute walk test (6MWT) is used to assess subjects’  functional exercise 
capacity. This assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_822648] 7 (T1) and week 15 (T2) 
physiological assessments. The 6MWT will be  conducted foll owing the  American Thoracic Society Guidelines [ADDRESS_1140856]: The Romberg Balance  is an assessment of the subjects balance and proprioception89. 
The patient will be asked to remove their shoes, stand with their feet together, arms held to their side or 
crossed in front of their chest. They will be asked to stand quietly with their eyes open and subsequently with 
their eyes closed. The assessor will maintain close proximity to the subject in case there is a loss of balance. 
Subjects will then be asked to stand heel to toe with one front directly in front of the other. Similar  to the first 
portion of the test patients will be asked to perform this assessment with eyes open and eyes closed.  Subjects 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_822649].    
18 
 
 
  
 
The baseline Standardized Fitness Assessment : The fitness assessment will evaluate the general health and 
physical characteristics of each patient  (See Appendix XI II). Specifically, data will be collected regarding 
height, weight, resting heart rate, blood pressure, body composition (ratio of lean body mass to fat mass), 
lower back and h amstring flexibility, aerobic fitness and physical strength. All tests will be age appropriate.  This 
information will be used to determine the initial exercise level most appropriate for the subject to begin the 
intervention study.  
Adherence  
Adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report of session completion (See Appendix III) and activity tracking via 
FitBit.  All participants will be asked to fill out a short [ADDRESS_1140857] to aid the child in planning and goal setting, but also to give parents an opportunity to provide 
positive reinforcement for the child’s daily exercise. The patients will also be asked to hit a start EX button on 
the FitBit at the beginning of the intervention which shows that they have started the video and then hit it again 
upon completion. The instructor in the video will prompt the child to start and stop their FitBit as a reminder.   
Acceptability 
Patient Satisfaction Survey : This satisfaction survey was adapted from an existing exercise intervention 
satisfacti on survey 90. The satisfaction survey consists of [ADDRESS_1140858] support. There is al so an open response question for additional feedback (See Appendi x XIV). 
Parent Satisfaction Survey: Parents will also be asked to complete a satisfaction survey regarding the exercise 
program, exercise videos , and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34722]. To assess the satisfac tion of the parents/caregivers of 
pediatric cancer patients (peripheral neuropathy symptoms) while participating in an exercise intervention during the Consolidation Phase of chemotherapy
90. The satisfaction survey consists of 13 items, and they will 
be asked to respond to each item using a 5 point scale. (See Appendi x XV)

I.5 Blood Sample Collection  
This study will include collection of a minimum of 15  mL of whole blood at 2  time points : baseline or pre -
intervention ( week 6)  and post -intervention (week 14). Blood samples will be stored at - 80°C until analysis for 
germline DNA, chemerin levels , NGF, SNAP1, GAP43  and cytokines PDGF -BB and IL -13.  Whenever 
possible, blood will be drawn at the same time as blood is drawn for rout ine clinical purposes. Blood will always 
be drawn by [CONTACT_300781]. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for this study for blood collection, 
processing, transfer and storage instructions.  
I.6 Data Processing  and Storage  
Survey Data:  All survey study data collected will be stored in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) 
database. REDCap is managed through the Department of Biostatistics in the Indiana University School of 
Medicine. Access to the password- protected database wil l be limited to study personnel, and any data shared 
outside of the study team will be de- identified prior to distribution.  
Fitbit  Data:  The Fitbit  data will be automatically imported to a Fitbit  application on the company’s secure server 
and then uploaded automatically to an ex cel file. The data will be downloaded weekly to a password protected 
master excel file folder stored on a university secured server and managed by [CONTACT_822650] (See 
human subjects section for further details). All physiol ogical measures: Heart Rate, Steps,  Distance and 
Activity , will be captured using the Fitbit  Charge HR.  
21 
 
 
 OnCore®: Individual patient registration will be done in the OnCore® database. All protocol deviations, study 
status updates (IRB approval, open to accr ual, etc.), IRB approvals, current protocol and consent, and any 
serious adverse events should they occur. The OnCore® database is a comprehensive, web- based, Clinical 
Trial Management System (CTMS) which utilizes an Oracle database. OnCore® was developed by [CONTACT_822651], Inc. and is used by [CONTACT_330649] (CTO) and supported by [CONTACT_822652] (CTSI).  OnCore® properly used is compliant with Title 21 CFR 
Part 11.  
OnCore® provides users secure access with unique IDs/passwords and restricts access by [CONTACT_164942], 
from any location, to record, manage, and report on data associated with the operation and conduct of clinical 
trials.  
All source documents are to remain in the patient’s clini c file.  All documents should be kept according to 
applicable federal guidelines.  Clinical trial data in OnCore® are periodically monitored by [CONTACT_822653] (DSMC).

Treatment Fidelity Focus  Description of Treatment Fidelity Indicators 
Design  The intervention was developed based on Social  Learning Theory with main construct 
focus on self -efficacy.  
Training The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_822628].  They are designing and leading the EX 
program and will perform all individual exercises together to ensure agreement of the 
performanc e expectat ion. One or both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_822629]’s  who will 
demonstrate the exercise on the video.  
Delivery  Each participant will receive a video of the exercises that are age appropriate and are suitable to their physical abilities. The videos will allow for a standardized intervention 
delivery for each subject.  
Receipt  Each participant will wear a Fitbit and upon starting the EX session will click the button on 
the side of the device to record the activity. All subjects will be remi nded to start and stop 
their Fitbits by [CONTACT_822654]’s  demonstrating the exercises on the video. All data 
from the Fitbit is collected via Fitabase (secure data site). There is also a pre and post 
survey each participant completes prior to and after their session (8 questions in total). 
The parent may add comments to the survey if they desire, but their initials are required.  
I.[ADDRESS_1140860] will get to keep the Fitbit  device that has been utilized for physical 
and aerobic training tracking.  Upon completion of this study a small end- of-study token in appreciation of the 
study participant’s  participation may be given.

 J. DATA ANALYSIS  
J.1 Baseline Analysis  
Baseline anal ysis.  Baseline demographic characteristics as well as baseline general health and physical 
characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) will be provided for all continuous variables and frequency and percent will be 
provided for all categorical variables.  All continuous scale outcomes will assessed for normality.  If normality does not seem plausible for a given outcome, than Wilcoxon -signed rank tests will be used.  Additionally, to 
examine reasons for attrition, baseline measures will be compared between patients that complete the 
intervention and those that do not.   Continuous measures will be compared with a t -test or Wilcoxon- rank sum 
test and categorical vari ables will be compared using a Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test.   
 
J.2 Aim 1 & 2 Analysis   
To address Aim 1, adherence in the intervention group will be measured through a 5  question survey at each 
treatment and also through start/stop on the Fitbit.  Adherence scores will be summarized across time with descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  From start/stop information, the 
proportion of exercise sessions completed and the proportion of patients which complete at least 50% of the 
exercise sessions along with associated 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. Additionally , descriptive 
statistics will be provided for the patient satisfaction sur vey provided at the end of the study.  
To address Aim  2, we will use paired t -tests to examine change from baseline (T1) to 14 weeks  (T2).  For 
outcomes which are known to be non- normal such as biomarkers, we will use Wilcoxon- signed rank tests.  We 
plan an intent -to-treat analysis.  Even if we do not see significant differences , descriptive statistics including 
means, SD, and effect sizes (differences in means between the two time points divided by [CONTACT_139740]) will be 
reported for outcomes along with 95% confidence intervals.  All analysis will include checking of assumptions.  Additionally, we will also use repeated measures ANOVA  to estimate the contrast of interest (change from 
baseline at 14 weeks) for primary and secondary outcomes, after adjusting for a ge and baseline activity level.  
For activity outcomes obtained from the FitBit , such as patients’ daily number of steps, distance, active 
minutes, and heart rate, we will start with simple techniques such as paired t -tests or Wilcoxon signed- rank 
tests to compare the mean change in activity level from baseline (T1: summarized over w eek 6) to treatment 
end (T2: summarized over week 13).  As an exploratory analysis, we will also use a generalized linear mixed 
model with appropriate distribution (e.g. Poisson) and link function fit to all weekly outcomes to examine 
changes over time usi ng time as a continuous variable.  We expect to have an abundance of information 
provided from the Fitbit, thus we will estimate descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum) for all outcomes (i.e., number of steps, distance, active mi nutes, and heart rate) at each week to aid 
in planning future studies.  
Based on our conceptual model, we will also examine associations between change scores for predictors and 
change scores for primary and secondary outcomes.  For example, we will estimat e Pearson correlations 
between changes in self -efficacy, outcome expectations, support, neuropathy, pain, and quality of life.    
We will also examine whether or not the circulating protein biomarkers at T1  are associated with VIPN severity  
at T1 using Spearman correlations and whether initial or dynamic levels of the circulating biomarkers are 
predictive of intervention efficacy. The associations between VIPN and the genetic and circulating biomarkers 
will be analyzed through generalized linear mixed models , which includes a random subject effect to account 
for the correlation of observations from the same subject.  
[ADDRESS_1140861] minimal dropout at 14 weeks (primary endpoint for the proposed trial) and have inflated the sample 
size to account for  the expected 15% attrition, so we anticipate it will not create any substantial bias in the 
results. To aid in future studies, we will compare baseline characteristics among those who complete the study 
and those who do not to determine if there are any c haracteristics associated with study completion.  
K. RISKS OF PARTICIPATION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
K.[ADDRESS_1140862] been addressed through 1) video design, 2) safety reminders during videos and 
fitness assessment and 3) muscle soreness. The video design is based on a specific gradual workout design 
to ensure safety for the most deconditioned patients. The study has incorporated beginner (seated or bed), 
intermediate (bridge between beginner and advanced) and advanced EX chapters .  
Reminders of safety will be discussed during the fitness assessment and also incorporated into all videos. The 
reminders will address proper footwear, proper clothing, workout areas clear of objects, availability of water 
bottle, ensure someone else is in the house while exercising, finally, if experiencing dizziness, chest pain or 
injury to stop immediately and tell a parent. Treatment for muscle soreness is to 1) not skip the warm -up or 
cool down sections of the video, massage the affected muscle groups or soak in a warm tub.  
Any injury will be reported per the study guidelines. Video reminders for injury will include 1) knowing where 
the First Aid Kit is located, 2) knowing where the closest phone is, 3) always reporting an injury to the 
parent/care- giver and  in case of severe injury to dial 911. Each patient and parents will have the phone 
number to both of the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s to answer any questions. In general, exercise does not provoke cardiovascular events in healthy individuals with normal cardiovascular systems. The risk of sudden cardiac 
arrest or myocardial infarction is very low in apparently healthy individuals performing moderate intensity, 
physical activity (Ref. ACSM’s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, Ninth Edition, 2014, p. 9, 
Chapter 1, Section: Risks Associated with Exercise).     
K.[ADDRESS_1140863] these risks:  
All personnel will be trained in the importance of and measures to protect patient conf identiality. Several 
measures will be taken to protect patient confidentiality. One measure will be assigning each participant a 
unique 6- digit identification number and using this number to identify the participant on all data collection 
forms. All data c ollected from participants will be kept separate from identifying information by [CONTACT_822655]. Any information collected on paper forms or by [CONTACT_822656] a study team member. The paper f orms will be filed in a locked file cabinet in the locked 
office space of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_822630]. Only those study team members who need access to this information will be allowed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_459107].

 Analyses will include onl y summaries of data; personal identifiers will be ex cluded. All personnel who are 
involved in the design or conduct of this research will have demonstrated successful completion of human 
subjects training.  
Since this study involves a very large amount of data to be collected from the Fitbit  tracker, we have put 
procedures in place to ensure the integrity of the data transmitted and to allow consistent handling of the 
clinical data. The Bioinformatics Core team at Indiana University has developed a web- based platform for the 
collection, integration, analysis and dissemination of both the clinical and biomarker data.  The platform 
provides a framework for the collection of biomarker data (i.e. cytokines and chemerin levels), the collection 
and the analysis of the data.  The web- based platform is easy to use with all the necessary securities to protect 
the confidentiality and integrity of the data.  All data are stored in a deidentified/HIPAA compliant manner.  The 
platform is developed using the Linux -Apachedcm x,m, xz-MySQL -PHP platform and CakePHP. This platform 
is widely used across the Internet.  Security is obtained by [CONTACT_136247] (SSL).  
K.3 Reporting to the IRB  
1. Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported promptly to the IRB if they:  
• unex pected;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
• suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known 
or recognized.    
If the serious adverse event does not meet all three (3) criteria listed above, the event does not have to be promptly reported to the Indiana University IRB.   However, it will be reported at the time of continuing review.  
2. Prompt reporting of unanticipated problems to the IRB is defined as withi n [ADDRESS_1140864] enter all initial and follow -up SAE, ex pedited, and 
noncompliance reports into OnCore® for review b y the DSMC chair and/or coordinator. E xpedited reports may 
include IRB Prompt Report Forms and additional SAE forms as required by [CONTACT_456]. When follow -up 
information is received, a follow -up report should also be created in OnCore®. This DSMC reporting 
requirement is in addition to any other regulatory bodies to be notified (i.e. IRB, FDA, pharmaceutical company, etc.). The DSMC chair and/or coordinator will review all SAE, ex pedited, and noncompliance reports monthly.  
IUSCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and patient safety. Quarterly review meetings for low risk 
trials are required and will include the principal investigator, clinical research specialist and/or research nurse 
(other members per principal investigator’s discretion). Quarterly meeting summaries should include review of 
data, the number of patients, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, and responses observed. 
Summaries will be submitted quarterly and reviewed by [CONTACT_941] D SMC for review. Submit to [EMAIL_4833].  
Study Auditing and Monitoring  
All trials conducted at the IUSCC are subject to auditing/monitoring. Reports will be forwarded to the DSMC for 
review.  
Early Study Closure  
At any time during the conduct of the tr ial, if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85263] (or benefits) to 
the patient warrant early closure of the study, this recommendation should be made in writing to the Data 
Safety Monitoring Committee. Alternatively, the DSMC may initiate suspension or early closure of the study 
based on its review of the investigator reports.  
25 
 
 
 Reporting Guidelines  
The DSMC has streamlined the reporting process by [CONTACT_164953]®. This has allowed direct 
view of reports within the Clinical Trials  Management System (CTMS); thus discontinuing paper report s. SAE 
reports are entered into OnCore® and reviewed by [CONTACT_85281]/or coordinator monthly.  
Study Accrual Oversight  
Accrual data will be entered into the IU Simon Cancer Center  OnCore®   system. The Protocol Progress 
Committee (PPC) reviews study accrual twice per year while the PPC coordinator reviews accrual quarterly.  
Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are entered into OnCore® and reviewed by [CONTACT_85281]/or coordinator monthl y.  
L. STUDY WITHDRAWAL/DISCONTINUATION  
Criteria for removal from the study are as follows:  
• The participant ex presses significant distress related to completion of the study (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_822631]).  
• The participant provides verbal or written notification that s/he has decided to discontinue study 
participation.  
Any other reason for which the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_822632].  
M. PATIENT CONSENT AND PEER JUDGEMENT  
The protocol and informed consent form for this study must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_144709] (IRB) prior to any patient being registered on this study.   
Changes to the protocol, as well as a change of principal investigator, must also be approved by [CONTACT_164950]. Records of the Institutional Review Board review and approval of all documents pertaining to this study must 
be kept on file by [CONTACT_822657]. Periodic s tatus 
reports must be submitted to the Institutional Review Board at least yearly, as well as notification of completion 
of the study and a final report within 3 months of study completion or termination.   
The study will be conducted in compliance with IC H guidelines and with all applicable federal (including 21 
CFR part s 56 & 50), state or local laws.

METHODOLOGY
Pediatric subjects, aged 9-16 years, requiring colonoscopy, who fulfill all screening criteria, and sign 
an informed consent and assent (as required), will be randomized to one of the treatment arms by [CONTACT_31359].  Subjects aged 9 years to 12 years will be randomized into 3 arms: Prepopik ½ sachet x2, Prepopik [ADDRESS_30662] of care. Subjects aged 13 years to 16 years will be randomized into 2 arms: Prepopik [ADDRESS_30663] and his/her parent/guardian on the use of the bowel preparation, and along with the subject and his/her parent/guardian, will sign a nondisclosure affidavit form ( APPENDIX 1 ), which 
will prevent the subject and the unblinded study coordinator from disclosing the bowel preparation treatment the subject used. Treatment will be blinded to the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_31321]/her assistant(s) assessing the efficacy of the tested preparations.
Colon cleansing will be performed using Prepopik for oral administration or oral PEG base 
preparation/local standard of care for oral solution.There are two Prepopik dosing regimens, each requires two separate dosing times:
• “Split Dose” method is the preferred method • “Day Before” method is the alternative method if “Split Dose” is not appropriate  (see Section 5 for dosing and fluid instructions)
Subjects randomized to the “Split Dose” Prepopik group will begin treatment (1
stdose) 1 day before 
colonoscopy between 5:00 and 9:00 PM, and will complete the treatment (2nddose) ≥[ADDRESS_30664] three 8 ounce glasses of clear liquids after the second administration (all of the clear liquids should not be water).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALDURATION OF TREATMENT
Prepopik: “Split Dose” treatment starts 1 day before colonoscopy (first sachet or first ½ sachet 
reconstituted), and completes* on the day of colonoscopy (second sachet or second ½ sachet reconstituted). 
*“Day Before” treatment option completes evening before colonoscopy.
Subjects randomized to the oral PEG based preparation (no enema or suppository)/local standard of care, will follow appropriate label and/or institutional instructions.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample size:
A total of at least 45 subjects will be exposed to Prepopik. In the two Phase 3 studies for adults, 83% 
and 84.2% of subjects were classified as success after bowel preparation with Prepopik. With 45 subjects, if 80% of subjects are classified as success in this study, the exact 95% confidence interval of the success rate will be calculated as 65% - 90%.
Statistical methods:
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects classified as success defined by 
[CONTACT_31360]. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT dataset. The proportion will be presented by [CONTACT_31361], for all Prepopik [ADDRESS_30670] of care groups combined with the 95% confidence interval. 
The treatment group difference will be assessed by [CONTACT_31362] 95% confidence interval of the 
difference in proportions between each Prepopik group and standard of care within each age group, all Prepopik [ADDRESS_30671] of care groups combined. 
The analyses will be conducted for the PP populations as well. The following secondary endpoints will be summarized in the same manner as the primary endpoint: 
proportion of subjects who completed colon cleansing, proportion of subject who record treatment as tolerable or better and proportion who rate treatment as satisfactory as provided on the Tolerability and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and proportion of subjects who completed colonoscopy procedure.
All the safety data will be summarized descriptively.

1A poor quality bowel preparation may require that the 
examination be repeated, resulting in additional health care costs, as well as inconvenience to the patient.
2  
Ideally, bowel cleansing should clear the colon of all solid material and cause no damage to the colonic 
mucosa. It should also be easy to administer, well tolerated by [CONTACT_31366](AEs), and cause minimal clinically relevant shifts in the patient’s fluid and electrolyte balance. Colon cleansing is not a pleasant procedure for the patient; therefore, compliance with any colon cleansing agent is critical. Accordingly, pretreatment with a colon cleansing agent should be suitable for the patient to self-administer at home with minimal inconvenience and relatively short duration. All of the above bowel cleansing parameters are especially true for the pediatric subject.
Prepopik
®(sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320], magnesium oxide and citric acid) powder for oral solution, which 
cleanses the colon by [CONTACT_3553] a combination of 2 established purgative mechanisms, fulfills all of these criteria. Prepopik was approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) on 16 July 2012 for cleansing of the 
colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults #[ADDRESS_30682], under the trade names Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31326], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31327], Pi[CONTACT_3252]-Salax, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31328], or Prepopik (hereafter referred to as Prepopik), is currently marketed in Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Hungary, Ireland, Jordan, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, [LOCATION_008], and the US. 
The active drug substances in each pouch of Prepopik are sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320] (10 mg), a stimulant 
cathartic, plus magnesium oxide (3.5 g) and citric acid (12.0 g) which, upon mixing with water, form magnesium citrate, an osmotic laxative. Magnesium citrate, as an osmotic laxative, acts in both the small and large intestine to increase the bulk of the intestinal contents by [CONTACT_31367]. A possible additional action on cholecystokinin, which may increase intestinal fluid and electrolyte accumulation, has been reported.
3Magnesium citrate has a rapid effect, 
producing a semi-liquid stool in approximately [ADDRESS_30683] is exerted only after hydrolysis of pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320], by [CONTACT_31368], to the active metabolite bis-(p-hydroxy-phenyl)-
pyridyl-2-methane.

[ADDRESS_30684].5,6Thus, the combination of these 2 therapeutically active components

Page 15 of 65Sodium Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320] + Magnesium 
Oxide + Citric AcidTrial Code: [ADDRESS_30685], enabling enhanced visibility for colonoscopy without 
mucosal harm.
Another important advantage of Prepopik is the ease with which patients can administer the preparation 
and how well it is tolerated. The preparation consists of a low-volume drink with a pleasant orange taste, followed by [CONTACT_31369]’s choice, with no forced-time schedule. 
It has not escaped our attention that this combination should make the product desirable for all patients, 
pediatric patients and, in particular, the especially non-compliant adolescents. Prepopik will likely result in improved patient compliance, thus promoting more complete and timely screening procedures.Only further pediatric-driven research can establish this fact.
1.[ADDRESS_30686] a potential for improvement.
Prepopik has been shown to be an effective and well-tolerated method for bowel preparation compared 
with polyethylene glycol (PEG) with electrolyte solution in children.
[ADDRESS_30687] an average molecular weight of 3350 g/mole and these are given the name [CONTACT_31410]-3350. There is a perception thatPEG is safe because it is minimally absorbed from the stomach and intestines. However, little is known regarding whether absorption in children differs from adults, especially in children who are constipated, have underlying intes tinal disease, or are very young.
In this study, the efficacy and safety of Prepopik will be compared with oral PEG based preparation 
(local standard of care) in children [ADDRESS_30688]-marketing requirement for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to add to the body of knowledge in colon cleansing in this population.  There is a long history of sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_31330].
Prepopik was first used in pediatrics in the [LOCATION_008] in approximately 1980 and is currently 
used in several Western health arenas. Over 30 years’ experience indicates that 12-18-year-old subjects respond well to the adult dosing. The current dosages used in pediatrics in the European Union for ages 9-18 years is 1 sachet (x2). In Canada, current pediatric dosage is ½ sachet (x2) for ages 9-12 years and 1 sachet (x2) for ages 13-18 years.  This dosage has been studied in a well-controlled trial from the Toronto Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31331]. It aimed to compare bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31332]. Thirty five of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31333] (81%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the clean out compared with 19 (48%) in the PEG group (p=.001).
7
Therefore, in our study, the younger group will compar e adult dose (1 sachet x2 as in the European 
Union) and ½ the adult dose (1/2 sachet x2, Canadian dose). Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated to assess potential age-related differences in systemic exposure to major constituents (pi[INVESTIGATOR_31334]).

Since the original application was approved in [ADDRESS_30689]-marketing adverse reaction 
reporting rate of <[ADDRESS_30690] be achieved without sacrificing patient safety. While oral sodium phosphate products are highly effective and well tolerated, the risk of acute phosphate nephropathy has resulted in a Black Box warning for high-risk groups, including people >[ADDRESS_30691] compliance as well as the overall effectiveness of the regimen. 
In the phase 3 studies in adults, Prepopik demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for use in colon 
cleansing prior to colonoscopy. Among treatment-emergent AEs considered by [CONTACT_31370], only nausea (2.8%), headache (2.2%), and vomiting (1.2%) were experienced by >1.0% of subjects who received Prepopik. No deaths occurred and the incidence of subjects who experienced serious AEs (SAEs) or prematurely discontinued from study due to AEs was <1.0%. Similar results were observed for subjects who received the active comparator, HalfLy tely, 
in the adult registration trials.
Additionally, clinical laboratory evaluation confirmed the safety of Prepopik in phase [ADDRESS_30692] led to transient increased magnesium levels in 
adult subjects following dosing in the phase 3 studies; however, the levels returned to baseline within 24-48 hours after the procedure without sequelae. 
Assessments of vital signs and centralized evaluation of electrocardiogram (3000 ECGs) data from the 
phase 3 studies showed no signal for Prepopik on any cardiac electro-physiological functions.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALBased on the worldwide safety data reported during the period covered by [CONTACT_31371] (01 June 1990 – 31 December 2010), the overall benefit-risk profile of Prepopik remains favorable. Review of literature has revealed no important new safety findings. The safety profile of Prepopik is broadly consistent with the known risks as reported in the most current Summary of Product Characteristics for Prepopik. Predictably, cumulative safety data indicate that, overall, 
gastrointestinal disorders were the most commonly reported type of reaction, including vomiting, 
diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. No novel or unexpected AEs were recorded in the adult registration trials.
A summary of the benefits and risks of Prepopik is provided in Table 1-1 . Prepopik offers a significant 
improvement over other currently marketed products in the US, with an ideal balance of efficacy,safety and tolerability for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy.

3.1 Overall Trial Design
This study is a randomized, assessor-blind, multicenter, dose-ranging study. Subjects undergoing an 
elective complete colonoscopy will randomly receive one of the following products:
!“Split Dose” Prepopik: 2 divided doses given the night before (first dose) and approximately 5 
hours prior (second dose) to procedure. A dose is defined for one subset of subjects aged 
9 years to 12 years as ½ sachet, for another subset of subjects aged 9 years to 12 years per 
randomization as 1 sachet and for subjects aged 13 to 16 years as 1 sachet. For “Day Before” 
Prepopik and fluids see Section 5.
!Oral PEG based preparation/local standard of care per appropriate label and/or institutional 
instructions.

Total subjects 45 30 75
Pediatric subjects requiring colonoscopy, who fulfill all screening criteria, and sign an informed 
consent and assent (as required), will be randomized. One of the treatment arm products will be provided to the subject in a randomized fashion. The designated unblinded coordinator will instruct the subject and his/her parent/guardian on the use of the bowel preparation, and along with the subject and his/her parent/guardian, will sign a nondisclosure affidavit form ( APPENDIX 1 ), which will prevent 
the subject and the unblinded coordinator from disclosing the bowel preparation treatment the subject 
used. Treatment will be blinded to the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_31321]/her assistant(s) assessing the efficacy of the 
2 tested preparations when local or institutional methods are used.  Their dosage timing and diet will be captured in the data. This approach had been used successfully in the Prepopik adult trials.
Colon cleansing will be performed using Prepopik for oral administration or oral PEG based
preparation/local standard of care for oral solution.

Approximately 6-8 sites in the US are planned. A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to 
ensure up to approximately 75 (~15 subjects per treatment arm).

28However, this study will 
compare Prepopik to oral PEG local standard of care preparations. Essentially, each endoscopic center has its own preparation concoction based on some combination of diet PEG 3350 sports drinks, enemasand stimulant laxatives.  
Each investigational site will be trained on the use of the Aronchick Scale both at the investigator 
meeting and at initial site visit; subjects will not be initiated until all assessing gastroenterologists involved in the study at the investigational site are confident in using this tool.
3.5.3 Blinding / Unblinding
Blinding
The study treatment(s) will be allocated according to computer-generated randomization codes 
prepared for all study sites. Treatment is blinded to the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_31321]/her assistant(s) performing the colonoscopy and assessing the efficacy of the tested preparations.
Prior to the start of the study, the investigator will assign a coordinator to act as the unblinded 
coordinator. This person will be responsible for distribution and accountability of the drug. The unblinded coordinator will instruct each subject as to the proper administration and the timing of the drug administration. This person will be available to answer the subject’s and parent’s/guardian’s questions regarding the study drug and its administration.

Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment
In case of an emergency, the emergency decoding envelope will be available to the investigator and the 
sponsor's medical officer. Breaking of the blind in individual subjects is only permitted in case of a serious, unexpected or other important AE, when the knowledge of the investigational product in question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of the subject.
If it is necessary to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of expedited reporting to 
the authorities, only those individuals within Ferring Pharmaceuticals whose responsibility it is to report this information will know the identity of the IMP. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all other study and site personnel will continue to remain blinded throughout the course of the study.
As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by [CONTACT_31374]. It should be recorded in the CRF that the blind is broken, why, when, and by [CONTACT_20898]. 
In case of accidental unblinding (e.g., the subject tells the assessor), the same documentation as for 
emergency unblinding must be obtained, i.e., the code envelope must be opened and why, when, and by [CONTACT_31375], and the event must also be recorded in the subject’s medical record.
It may be necessary to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of expedited reporting 
to the authorities and/or IRBs. In that situation, every effort will be made to maintain blinding of sponsor personnel involved in data analysis and interpretation. Other personnel may be unblinded for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, including trial site staff as well as staff acting on behalf of Ferring.
Information on whether the blind has been broken for any subjects must be collected before the 
database is declared clean and is released to the statistician.

subject must be advised to agree to follow-up safety investigations, which will include all procedures outlined in the follow-up visit.
The subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time at the discretion of the investigator; the 
reason should be discussed with the sponsor prior to discontinuing the subject and the reason fully documented in the CRF. Should the subject, during the course of the study, develop conditions, which would have prevented him/her entry into the study according to the exclusion criteria, he/she must be withdrawn immediately.

During Visit 4 (5 [ ∀2] days after colonoscopy) the subject will return to the site for a laboratory 
sample (chemistry and hematology), urinalysis, orthostatic vital signs and an assessment of any AEs
and concomitant medications.
At Visit 5 (28 [ ∀5] days after colonoscopy), the investigator or coordinator will interview the subject or 
parent/guardian via phone about any changes in concomitant medications, concomitant illness, or any new illnesses since the last visit. New illnesses or worsening in concomitant illnesses should be reported as AEs.

4.2.1 Recruitment
The site will recruit subjects based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and local recruitment practices. 
Recruitment materials cannot be used prior to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 
Each trial site will require potential participants to undergo a Screening Visit prior to randomization to 
a treatment group. Each patient will receive a unique screening number which must be entered in a screening log that must be maintained at each trial site. The screening number will be allocated sequentially in the order in which the patients are screened. The results of each screening should be recorded in the screening log. Selected data for screened patients should also be entered in the CRF, along with the reason for screening failure if the patient is not randomized to treatment. Under no circumstances will patients screened in the trial be permitted to be re-screened for a second time in this trial.

Adverse Event
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AE more than once and the subject recovers in between the events, 
the AEs should be recorded separately. If an AE changes in intensity, a worst-case approach should be used when recording the event, i.e., the highest intensity and the longest duration of the event.

abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the date the sample was taken or the examination was performed. 
Intensity
The intensity of an AE must be classified using the following 3-point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activityModerate: Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing)Severe: Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable)
Causal Relationship to IMP
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the AE must be classified as one of the following:
Reasonable possibility: There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. The AE
may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.
Examples: 
!AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure
!AEs that are not commonly associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in association 
with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal association or the 
event recurs on rechallenge
No reasonable possibility :
There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the 
AE.
Examples:
!known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation

Serious Adverse Events during the Trial
An event is defined a serious 
adverse event if it:Guidance
results in death Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within four weeks after the treatment ends and irrespective of the causal relationship to the IMP. The death of a subject enrolled in a trial is per 
senot an event, but an outcome.
is life-threatening The term life-threatening refers to an AE in which the subject was at immediate risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which may have caused death if it were more severe.

medically important event). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31347]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned before 
trial inclusion are not considered AEs, if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the trial, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the trial.
results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacityDisability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical judgment by 
[CONTACT_093].
is a congenital anomaly/birth 
defectCongenital anomaly/birth defect observed in any offspring of the subject conceived 
during treatment with the IMP.
is an important medical event Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31348]. 
Examples of important medical events include AEs that suggest a significant hazard, 
contraindication or precaution, occurrence of malignancy or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in 
deciding whether events qualify as medically important.
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious agent 
via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g. prion protein 
transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent 
may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an 
infection in a subject exposed to a medicinal product.

13.3 Publications and Public Disclosure
13.3.1 Publication Policy
At the end of the trial, one or more manuscripts for joint publication may be prepared in collaboration 
between the investigator(s) offered authorship and Ferring. In a multi-site trial based on the collaboration of many sites, any publication of results must acknowledge all sites. Results from multi-site trials must be reported in entirety in a responsible and coherent manner and results from subsets should not be published in advance or without clear reference to the primary publication of the entire trial.
Authorship is granted based on the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)
criteria (see current official version: http/www.ICMJE.org). The total number of authors is based on the guideline from the relevant journal or congress. In the event of any disagreement in the content of a publication, both the investigator’s and Ferring’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_31350].
Any external contract research organization or laboratory involved in the conduct of this trial has no 
publication rights regarding this trial.
If the investigator wishes to independently publish/present any results from the trial, the draft 
manuscript/presentation must be submitted in writing to Ferring for comment prior to submission. Comments will be given within [ADDRESS_30754] the disclosure of Ferring’s intellectual property. If the matter considered for publication is deemed patentable by [CONTACT_2247], scientific publication will not be allowed until after a filed patent application is published. Under such conditions, the publication will be modified or delayed at the investigator’s discretion, to allow sufficient time for Ferring to seek patent protection of the invention.

Additional Guidelines
For Diabetes Management
Even though you will be on a diet of clear fluids for the whole day before your colonoscopy 
examination, it is still possible for you to get sufficient carbohydrates in this diet. Besides drinking lots 
of fluids you must remember that these fluids need to contain sufficient amounts of carbohydrate. If you don’t drink enough fluids your blood sugars may go low, or surprisingly, they may begin to go higher.
Guidelines
!Follow the directions of the doctor for taking your insulin or pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].
!Your blood sugars should be monitored regularly. Please discuss this with your doctor, nurse or 
dietitian.
!You must meet your needs for more fluids. Drink a lot of water, clear soup, clear broth, sugar-
free drinks, sugar-free popsicles, and sugar-free jello. Do not drink anything red. Your goal is to 
drink at least one tall glass of fluid every hour, and have plenty of fluids as your meals for the day. There is no restriction to these.
!In addition to fluids, you must also meet your needs for carbohydrate every hour. See the list 
below for the drink ideas and portion sizes for your hourly need during the day.
To get enough carbohydrate during the day, take one choice from this list every waking hour:
!one quarter cup white grape juice
!one half cup regular soda pop
!one third cup regular Kool-Aid
!one quarter cup sherbet!one third cup apple juice
!one quarter cup regular jello
!one half popsicle
!two hard candies
Call the doctor ……
!If you have persistent nausea or vomiting
!If you have questions or worries.

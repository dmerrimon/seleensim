Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  Summary of Protocol Changes  
Protocol Version  Summary of Key Changes  
1.0 • Original Protocol  
1.1 • Addition of 10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_28888]  
• Minor refinements to protocol details throughout  
1.2 • Addition of allergens  and updates on Phase III activities.  
 
 
DermAI -[ADDRESS_1208594] dermatitis (ACD) and irritant contact [CONTACT_8748]  (ICD) . ACD is a type of IV -
mediated hypersensitivity to a specific allergen, resulting in an inflammatory response with 
exposure. ICD is a non-immunologically  drive n, inflammatory reaction to an irritating substance.    
 
ACD is common, with some studies demonstrating prevalence rates as high as 20% of the general 
population (Alinaghi, Bennike, Egeberg, Thyssen, & Johansen, 2018) . It can be difficult to 
distinguish ACD from other forms of dermatitis. History, patch testing , and other forms of 
assessments  may help to clarify the diagnosis.  
 
The cause of allergic contact [CONTACT_866228] p atch testing performed by 
[CONTACT_83190] . 
1.2. Investigational Agent s 
 
This protocol is in preparation of the creation of an integrated test kit consisting of a novel physical 
patch design , custom allergen panels, digital photography, and a  computer vision -based algorithm  
to interp ret the patch test results.  These innovation s represent a future state of technology.  Within 
scope of this protocol is an adaptation  of existing patch testing supplies  and a test of the 
performance of the AI algorithm performance in a manner that does not inform or alter the routine 
clinical diagno stic practice to minimize risk.  
 
The prospective data collection will involve multiple digital photography technologies. The 
primary photography device is an iOS -based custom application that allows for automated 
photograph capture and scheduling.  This smartphone application will be used by [CONTACT_866229] a study -specific iPhone [ADDRESS_1208595]  of the AI processing will  not 
be involved in the capture or transfer of the data in the current configuration. The models will be 
run asynchronously using the data captured during the study.  In addition to this smart phone 
application, we will also use additional cameras, including a full -spectrum ( infrared + ultraviolet 
+ visible light spectrums ), to ensure the model performance is not contingent upon the iPhone 
model used in the study along with providing new data  to potentially enhance the detection of 
contact [CONTACT_866230].

Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  1.2.1.  Camera technologies under study  
 
Visible Light Digital Photography (“regular” photography) : A standard iOS camera system will 
be the primary camera used in the study. This camera will be supplemented with cameras used 
during routine clinical documentation of the testing (i.e., a combination of Mayo Clinic owned and 
operated smartphones and interc hangeable lens cameras.  
 
Full Spectrum Photography:   A full -spectrum digital photography system is one where the digital 
sensor has had the Bayer filter removed. This allows all wavelengths of light to reach the imagining 
sensor , including the ultraviolet spectrum (not visible with the unaided eye). A “Wood’s light” (or 
black light) uses ultraviolet light to accentuate different aspects of the skin, particularly 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_866217]. The study will also need to incorporate infrared light sources to best utilize 
the spectrum of lig ht energy a camera can capture.  A full spectrum camera can photograph the 
same wavelength of light, particularly if a glass filter that allows only a narrow range of 
wavelengths to pass is used. Likewise, infrared is used by [CONTACT_866231] (and door sensor 
technolog ies) to identify subtle differences in heat profiles in objects. We are hypothesizing that 
the combination of ultraviolet and infrared spectra will improve the detection of allergic contact 
[CONTACT_866232].   
 
Photogrammetry:  While a single photograph  may characterize the appearance of raised textures 
on the skin surface, photogrammetry  allows for direct modeling of the surface of the skin.  Briefly, 
photogrammetry is an established technique where an object (e.g., a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_11929]) is 
photographed from [ADDRESS_1208596] that is a digital representation of the surface of the skin. We hypothesize that this 
3D representation of the skin lesion will convey important “tactile” information about the test sites 
that is not otherwise present in standard 2D digital  photographs.  
 
1.2.2.  Allergens  
The use of the allergens are  in accordance with standard clinical practice. However, the allergens 
are not FDA approved for this purpose.  As such, they will be considered as investigational agents 
in the context of this study.   
 
1.2.3.  Test Patch  
The physical patch test device is a clinical standard apparatus manufactured by [CONTACT_866233]. The 
allergens are applied to the skin by [CONTACT_866234].  Allergens are contained in an inert metal well.  For the purpose of this study, the paper -
like border surrounding these metal wells will be modified to allow for specific visual patterns to 
be drawn onto the skin using a standard surgical marker  (blue shaded regions in the figure below) . 
These markin gs will allow for the finalized AI workflow to identify unique allergen placement 
profiles based on markings drawn on the skin.

1.3. Preliminary Data  
1.3.1.   Study #1: IRB 19 -012164  
To-date, retrospective data collection under IRB  19-012164  has enrolled 310 subjects with 5,417 
reaction photogra phs (approximately 54,170 individual reaction sites)  which includes images 
taken both from the prior patch design as well as the new, fiducial patch design.  
 
We have designed a deep learning classifier to predict the presence of allergic reaction from 
smartphone images of patch test reaction sites. The model was tested on a dataset of 260 patches 
(2,600 individual reactions) from several dozen individuals.  
 
On the test dataset, the model displayed area under the ROC curve of 0.877. At a prediction cutoff 
of 10%, the model had an accuracy of 0.942 , a sensitivity ( true positive rate) of 0.54 0, and a 
specificity (true negative rate) of 0.956. The ROC curve is shown below, along with several 
examples of correct and incorrect predictions .

reaction  site is shown on the left, the true reaction label (based on the clinical report) is shown in 
the middle, and the model prediction is shown on the right. Positive and negative predictions are  
shown on a continuous color scale, where 1 (red) indicates the presence of reaction and 0 (blue) 
indicates the absence .  
 
1.3.2.   Study #2: Prospective Clinical Trial ( IRB 21 -011596)  
 

DermAI -[ADDRESS_1208597] dermatitis. While the deep learning algorithm’s performance could be 
established relative to the in -clinic reference reading, it was unknown just how well a human 
reader could function when only exposed to the photographs of the test sites (i.e., not able to 
palpate suspi[INVESTIGATOR_542847]). To address this, the study incorporated a human reading protocol 
where the same photographs, void of any data collected about the patient or inf ormation obtained 
during the clinical visit, were reviewed by [CONTACT_866235].  
 
A total of 232 participants consented to participate and 206 reached the day five assessment. A 
specific purpose of this study was to enroll 50% of participants with Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV – 
VI. This objective was achieved as t he distribution of skin types over the six types  were as 
follows:  46.6% were classified as types IV -VI. The mean (SD) participant age was 39.1 (13.5) 
years, and 66% (136/206) of the participants were female. A total of 32.0% (66/206) of 
participants self -identified as being Black o r African American, 16.5% (34/206) as Asian 
(34/206), and 40.3% as White (83/206). A total of 23 participants self -identified as Other 
(11.2%) or of Hispanic origin (73.9%, 17/23).   
 
The overall incidence of allergic contact [CONTACT_866236] 6.4% (132/2,060)  using the 
panel of allergens to be tested in the present study. The [ADDRESS_1208598] sites that 
were expertly evaluated during the in clinic (Day 5) evaluation. The only input to the neural 
network was the cropped image of the patch test site sites. The CNN model diagnosed the 
presence or absence of reactio n with an AUROC of 0.861 (95% CI, 0.824 – 0.897). Using the 
previously selected cutoff of 4.88%, this ge nerated an accuracy of 91.0% (95% CI, 89.7% -
92.2%), a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% CI, 49.4% -66.8%), and a specificity of 93.3% (95% CI, 
92.0% -94.3%).  
 
1.4. Risk s and Benefits  
 
The risks of this research study are minimal. The most common side effect of skin testing is slightly 
swollen, red, itchy bumps (wheals). These wheals may be most noticeable during the test. In some 
people, though, an area of swelling, redness and itching may develop a few hours after the test and 
remain for a couple of days.  
Rarely, allergy skin tests can produce a severe,  immediate allergic reaction.  
 
The patches are placed on the forearm for 48 hours. During this time, bathing and activities that 
cause heavy sweating  need to be avoided . Irritated skin at the patch site may indicate an allergy.

As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we 
will take all appropriate precautions to minimize this risk.

3. Study Design  
3.1. General Description  
 
The overall  adaptive  study is designed to include three consecutive phases . Prior to the start of the 
adaptive study , a pi[INVESTIGATOR_866218] 10 participants are planned to optimize the study protocol  
logistics, including camera usage, image capture parameters and documentation, and lighting 
conditions. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_866219]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_866220].  The data collected will be used to refine 
the protocol, with amendments as necessary.  
 
DermAI -005  Version 1 .1 
  Revised March 29,  2024 
Page 12 of 31 
Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  Each of the phases in the adaptive study is intended to advance the technologies and evaluate how 
scalable the technologies will be outside the clinical practice.  The phases described below cover 
the primary intended workflow  using the Mayo Clinic owned iPhone. Additional protocol actions 
including additional photography and ascertainment of other clinical study data (including adverse 
events) will occur to enrich the study data.  
 
Common study flow for all phases of the study:  
 
On day [ADDRESS_1208599] dermatitis will be provided by a medical professional with 
training in patch testing to establish the reference criterion.   
 
 
 
Specific adaptation according to each phase of the study:  
 
Phase 0 (n <=10): This pi[INVESTIGATOR_866221] [ADDRESS_1208600] the three 
main phases of the study.  
 
Phase 1 (n=100):  Phase 1 initiates where the prior  pragmatic clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]0, IRB 
21-011596) concluded . This phase of the study will advance the technology in material ways 
through shifting day 3 (patch removal) and day 5 (final photographic documentation of test site ) 
to the  participant in the study .  Participants will be guided in the use of the application and primary 
iOS/iPhone photographic documentation; the study team will provide additional photographic 
documentation and review of the te st site to establish the reference criterion .  
 
Phase 2 (n=25):  For phase 2, the patch will be placed on the inside of the arm by [CONTACT_866238] 1.   
 
Quality Checkpoint Decision: Patch able to be successfully applied by [CONTACT_866239] >90% of the cases 
(fewer than 3 placement errors).  
 

DermAI -005  Version 1 .1 
  Revised March 29,  2024 
Page 13 of 31 
Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  Phase 3 (n=25):  In phase 3, the entire study will be patient -led, although on -campus visit s will be 
required to obtain the allergen panel  and evaluate the reference criterion . This phase will use a 
prototype novel test kit with printed instructions and necessary supplies to clean the arm, assemble 
the patch application jig, install the app, and perform the patch testing. Human observation and 
patient surveys will be conducted to evaluate the human factors aspects of the test kit.   
 
For both Phases [ADDRESS_1208601] exposures. The recommendations 
will be con strained to only the set of allergens tested in this protocol  (See Section 5.2). Participant 
will have the option to select the standard allergens used in Phase 1 of the study or use up to 10 of 
the recommended allergen s based on the Patient Journey .  
3.2. Number of Subjects  
 
Up to a  total of 160 participants will be enrolled and tested  as part of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (n<=10) or 
adaptive study (n=150) . 
3.3. Duration of Participation  
 
An individual participant will require three visits to the study site on Days 1, 3 and 5.  
 
 
3.4. Identification of Source Data  
 
Study -specific case report forms (CRFs) will be used to document  all of the following:  
1. Demographics and medical history including assessment of Fitzpatrick skin types  
2. Patient will be assigned to one of the randomized allergen templates that will be used for 
the study.  
3. Documentation of the randomized location of the allergens on the test patch used with the 
participant  
4. Documentation of the reference criterion (in person assessment  by [CONTACT_866240] 5)  as well as the initial impression of reactions at Day [ADDRESS_1208602] patching  
6. Documentation of the blinded human review of the photographs acquired on Day 3 and 
Day 5 
7. Adverse events  
 
 
The following source data will not be directly collected in the CRFs , but will be integrated into the 
master database : 
• Test site photographs  
• AI predictions on the photographs  
 
DermAI -[ADDRESS_1208603] Selection Enrollment and Withdrawal  
4.1. Inclusion Criteria  
• Adults aged 18 or older  
• Willing and a ble to provide  informed  consent  
 
4.2. Exclusion Criteria  
• Under 18 years of age  
• Has used topi[INVESTIGATOR_866222] s prior to patch testing  
• Currently taking immunosuppression  agents or is immunocompromised due to medical 
condition  
• No sunburn or rash at site of testing  
• Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant.  
• Treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light (including tanning) during the two weeks prior to 
visit.  
• Subjects unable to comply  with patch test study requirements including multiple return 
visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting patch test area from excess moisture due to 
showering)  
 
4.3. Subject Recruitment , Enrollment  and Screening  
 
The recruitment for this study will include participants from Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012] patients and staff, 
and collaboration with the University of North [LOCATION_012].  
In 2019, approximately [ADDRESS_1208604] is 10% (1,684) Black or African American, 13.3% 
(2,280) Hispanic or Latino, and 5% (853) two or more races. Potential participants can contact [CONTACT_866241]/or electronic display to further inquire on eligibility criteria 
and study questions.  
Thus, we estimate that from a pool of [ADDRESS_1208605] undergone previous patch testing will be screened by [CONTACT_866242] a Fitzpatrick skin types 4 through 6 and eligibility criteria. This 
study coordinator will call the patient to discuss the study, eligibility,  and study logistics, and then 
will plan to meet the patient at their next visit to the clinic to review and sign the consent (if the 
patient wishes to participate and is eligible).  
Potential participants who answer the advertisement will have a call scheduled with the study 
coordinator to discuss the study, eligibility,  and study logistics. Based on the potential participant’s 
agreement, the study coordinator will schedule a research visit, as well coordinate with the 
Dermatology medical assistants to schedule the patch testing procedures.  
The study coordinators are skilled in presenting the trial information without bias or pressure  and 
in a culturally appropriate manner. Translators will be used as needed. Study coordinators will ask 
those patients who remain initially undecided if they may contact [CONTACT_866243] a determined 
timeframe to review again and ask further questions. Scree ning and enrollment failures and related 
reasons for same will be discussed at the monthly review meetings and potential actions will be 
taken as need. Attention  will be paid to adhering to regulatory issues.  
4.4. Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1.  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Participants may withdraw at any point in the study. In the event the test patch is removed early   
due to possible reaction to an allergen  or for another other reason (e.g., removed while bathing), 
the study team will be notified of the event.  
4.4.2.  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
Participation is strictly voluntary. The participant will be followed according to protocol to 
document the reactions if the participant is willing. If the participant is unable or unwilling to 
continue with protocol procedures, the study records will be noted as such.  
 
5. Test Patch and Allergen Details   
5.1. Description  of test patch  vehicle

Page 17 of 31 
Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  For Phase II and III of the study, the following ten allergens will be added to the pool of 10 unique 
allergens tested in the primary patch  and the combination of allergens offered as a part of the two 
combination patches .  
• Linalool  
• P-phenylenediamine  
• Benzisiothiazolinone, 0.1p  
• Methylchloroisothiazinoline / methylisothiazinolone  
• Paraben mix  
• Formaldehyde  
• Tea Tree Oil  
• Cobalt Chloride  
• Disperse Dye (Blue Mix)  
• Gold Sodium Thiosulfate  
 
This patient -driven combination of allergens can have between [ADDRESS_1208607] sites  
allowing for measurement of preference for “body burden” and patch test configurations.   
5.3. Method for Assigning  Allergens to Test Site Regions   
 
To minimize complexity of the randomization process  and preparation of the patch test  for the 
primary test site , a total of four randomized placement sequences will be  generated.  Participants 
will be assigned to these sequences in consecutive order . This same randomization sequence will 
be used to randomize the secondary patch option to the participants  with participants holding an 
odd study number receiving Combination #1 and even study numbers receiving #2. Note these 
two patches are largely identical except for how the allergens are combined with the ex ception 
that Combination #2 has methylchloroisothiazinoline / methylisothiazinolone  added to it.  
 
5.4. Preparation and Application of Test Patches  
 
The application of the allergens to the test patch will be conducted according to the Study 
Operation Manual. This manual will include the documentation of safe storage and handling 
practices of the allergens, templates of the randomized allergen locations, and guidelines for the 
application of the patch to the participant’s arm.  
5.5. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
 
The primary compliance consideration for this study is the maintenance of the test patch over the 
first three days. The participant will be given information on showering and other personal 
hygiene considerations while the patch es are worn. Early removal or contamination of the test 
patch will be documented on Day 3 during the participant ’s visit.  Deviations from the expected 
protocols will be documented on study case report forms.

Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  5.6. Masking/ Blinding of Study  
 
The medical professional  that reads the photographs of the test sites will be blinded to all clinical 
information including, but not limited to, the allergen’s randomized locations, the in-person  
assessment of the reactions, and any AI predictions on the images . Effectively, the human read of 
the photograph will only have the photograph available to form all impressions about the 
reactions.  
 
The reading of the human interpretation of the photographs will occur at least [ADDRESS_1208608] an opportunity to 
complete the Patient Journey. For Phases II and III of the study, this patient 
journey will be distributed to the patient prior to Visit 1 to allow for the data to be

7.1. Sample Size Determination  
 
The primary sample size is determined based on Phase I of the study. With an expectation that 
15% of the test sites will be positive, based on the selection of allergens with the highest 
incidence of reactions, and a target sensitivity of 95%, 90% power, and a minimum clinically 
relevant difference of [ADDRESS_1208612] (or variance inflation effect) is  not applied to account for potential clustering of 
reactions per participant. Therefore, with the assumption that each participant will have 1.[ADDRESS_1208613] panel that either were a reaction

Primary Hypothesis:  
 
The AI algorithm will provide non -inferior performance measured by [CONTACT_866247] . 
 
To test the primary hypothesis, The primary hypothesis to be tested is the “agreement” between 
the clinical (in person) evaluation and the human review  and AI predictions  of the app captured 
images.  Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be structured to estimate the clustered 
accuracy using an identity link and robust variance estimator to account for the clustering within 
the database. The model will have a single predictor that indicates which reader (AI vs. human) 
is associated with the accuracy de termination (a 1/0 with 1 indicating the “reader” reached the 
same conclusion as the expert, in person review). For the purpose of the primary outcome 
measure, the prediction from either the human or AI algorithm will be dichotomized into no 
reaction (grade 0) vs. any reaction (grades 1 – 4). The estimate and 95% CI for the “reader” 
effect will summarize the differential performance between the 
human and AI interpretations. For the AI algorithm to be 
considered non -inferior, a limit of inferiority of 5 perc entage 
points will be used. The fitted model will be used to estimate 
the overall performance and 95% CI for the two readers. As 
shown in the figure, we desire both the human and AI 
performance to provide greater than 95% accuracy .  
 
To supplement this analysis, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC 
ROC) will be computed using the visual analog scale by [CONTACT_866248]’s output. DeLong’s test will be used to compare the differences in 
performance between these two approaches.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis 1:   
 
For the secondary endpoint of agreement on the [ADDRESS_1208614] measures of diagnos tic performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity).  
These statistics will be computed as is customary for similar studies.  The calculations will be 
performed two ways when possible.  First, each test site will be assumed to be statistically 
independent in the rating.  For the neural network, this is how the algorithm functions.  For the 
human reading, there may be some correlation among the ratings based on the reactions, if any, 
that are observed. To address this, an exploratory analysis will be conducted using generalized 
estimating equations to examine the impact empi[INVESTIGATOR_866225] (i.e., confidence interval width).   
 
Safety data  will be summarized by [CONTACT_866249]. These will be 
categorized according to allergen related  or study protocol related . 

DermAI -[ADDRESS_1208615] site. A secondary analysis will be conducted to quantify the agreement of reactions to the 
same allergens alone (primary test patch) and in combination (secondary test patch) .  Kappa will 
be used to quantify this agreement.  
 
Finally, participant feedback on the study including the wearability of the patch on the forearm 
will be summarized using standard qualitative methods. This will include the extraction of key 
themes as well as listing open ended feedback provided to the study team by [CONTACT_3038].  
7.3. Additional Statistical Considerations  
7.3.1.  Descriptive Statistics  
 
Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated, as appropriate for 
all variables.  Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and 
secondary) will be tabulated for the enrolled participants. These summaries will be summarized 
for the overall sample and by [CONTACT_537305] .   
7.3.2.  Handling of Missing Data  
 
Missing data may occur throughout the study.  The primary analysis, which is based on the AI 
and human interpretation of the images relative to the in-person  assessment, will require that all 
test site regions have an interpretation of the reaction grade. If missing data is not able to be 
obtained by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -assessing the data, a “worst case” imputation strategy will be used. With this 
missing data will be included  in the denominator of test sites tested but none of the regions will 
be included in the numerator for measurement of accuracy or concordance between AI and 
human interpretation (i.e., is counted as a “miss” in the analysis).  For demographic and medical 
history data, any missing data will be reported as such in the final analysis.  
7.3.3.  Multiplicity  
 
There will be no adjustment to the level of significance for multiple testing.  All results will be 
reported unadjusted at the alpha=0.05 level of significance using estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals.  
7.3.4.  Interim Analysis  
 
There is no planned interim analysis.  
7.3.5.  Analysis Sets  
 
The analysis set for this study will follow the modified intention to treat principle.  To be included 
in the analysis, the participant needs to be randomized and complete at least the day 5 assessment 
(final documentation of the skin reactions).  Particip ants that study the allergen exposure challenge 
early are still eligible for the final analysis provided they consent to a day 5 assessment (see 
schedule of assessment early in the event the day 5 assessment occurs earlier).

8. Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1. Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; 
(6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new inf ormation (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293129], safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the research data , AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e., unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it wa s unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product ( i.e., drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include ; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869]  
• persistent or significant  disability or incapacity  
• substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• birth defect/ congenital anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator  
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
DermAI -[ADDRESS_1208616] patch application (Day 1) and Day 5 should 
be reported on the study CRFs.  
 
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and docum ented as an adverse 
event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor -investigator should instruct each subject to report , to the sponsor -
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202110] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be document ed as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
  
8.2. Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the study team  must seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event section  of the case report form (CRF ).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic , laboratory or  procedure results should be recorded in the source document . 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable  cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up , to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting 
Period  and is considered to be at lea st possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
DermAI -[ADDRESS_1208617] the study participant.  The sponsor -investigator will evaluate the event and determine 
the necessary follow -up and reporting required.  
8.3.1.  Sponsor -Investigator  reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB  
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258] -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68259].  
 
 
8.3.2.  Sponsor -Investigator reporting: Notifying the FDA  
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the FDA  all unexpected, serious suspected adverse 
reactions according to the required IND Safety Reporting timelines, formats,  and requirements . 
 
Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be 
reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported  to the FDA -on-FDA  
Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the 
information about the event.  
 
Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious 
suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA -on-FDA  Form 3500A, no later 
than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the 
event.  
 
Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those 
listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  
This will be reported to the FDA -on-FDA  Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the 
sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
The sponsor -investigator must also notify the FDA (and sponsors must  notify all participating 
investigators) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other 
source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines 
that the information qualifi es for reporting under § 312.32(c)(1)(i) -(iv). 
 
Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed 
to the drug will be reported.   This will be reported to the FDA -on-FDA  Form 3500A, no later than 
15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigators initial receipt of the information about the event.

Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  8.4. Unmasking/ Unblinding Procedures  
 
In the event of a reaction to one of the allergens, the primary medical professional performing the 
in-person  evaluation will have access to the unblinding information (i.e., identification of the 
allergens for each test site). The cause of any reactions will be denoted in the study records  and 
communicated to the participant.  
 
8.5. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_866226].  In the event the 
feasibility of the study is not tenable due to challenges in recruitment or other study operational 
considerations, the study may be terminated at the request of the study sponsor in conjunction with 
the institutional review board of record.  
8.6. Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above . 
9. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
9.1. Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
1. What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
2. Who will have access to that information and why?  
3. Who will use or disclose that information?  
4. The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization t o collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2. Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or eval uation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subjec t files, and 
DermAI -005  Version 1 .1 
  Revised March 29,  2024 
Page 29 of 31 
Mayo Clinic   CONFIDENTIAL  records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial.  
9.3. Case Report Forms  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF is expected to be  recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space 
on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be 
printed legibly in ink.  If any entry error has been made, draw a single straight line through the 
incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  
Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.   For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print 
the clarification above the item, initial and date it.   If the reason for the correction is not clear or 
needs additional explanation, neatly include the details to justify the correction.  
 
Data Management  
 
Data recorded on CRFs will be entered into a password protected, change -audited electronic data 
management system  (REDCap or equivalent). Data will be structured to document missing data, 
when appropriate. All changes to data saved to the database will have a timestamp indicating the 
user account that made the change to the data.   
 
Standard reports on data quality will be configured to identify possible errant data elements.  In 
the event a questionable data is identified, the data will be confirmed using original study records.  
9.4. Records Retention  
 
The sponsor -investigator will maintain records and essential documents related to the conduct of 
the study.  These will include subject case histories and regulatory documents.  
 
Case report forms will be designed to identify each subject -by-subject  entry number and, where 
appropriate, subject's initials, the product being evaluated, and the results observed. All entries to 
the CRFs must be made as instructed by [CONTACT_154976] . Data on subjects collected on 
CRFs during the study will be documented in an anonymous fashion, and the subject will only be 
identified by [CONTACT_49252], and by [CONTACT_5657]/her initials, if also required.  
 
All records will be kept in conformance to applicable national laws and regulations. The original 
signed ICF will be attached to each subject’s file. When the study treatment is completed, the 
ICF will be kept in the appropriate file folder; otherwise,  a note indicating where the records can 
be located will be made.  Documents will be stored in a password protected Mayo secure server 
as well as in a locked cabinet, where the study team is the only ones to have access to.  
 
The investigator will retain the specified records and reports for  
• Up to 2 years after the marketing application is approved for the drug; or, if a marketing 
application is not submitted or approved for the drug, until 2 years after shipment and 
DermAI -005  Version 1 .1

10. Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1. Study Monitoring Plan  
 
The Investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The investigator will 
also ensure the monitor or other compliance,  or quality assurance reviewer has access to all 
study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), 
and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
10.2. Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the 
sponsor, and government regulatory agencies, of a ll study related documents ( e.g., source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities ( e.g., pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_109891].  
11. Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to U nited States  government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted  local  Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the 
study.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to 
the sponsor -investigator before commencement of this study.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol  for review and approval by [CONTACT_271490].  The formal consent of a subject, using the approved IRB consent form, must be 
obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed 
by [CONTACT_29159]’s l egally authorized representative , and the i ndividual obtaining the 
informed consent .

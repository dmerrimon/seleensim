ary tabulations will be presented that will display 
desc
riptive statistics for each treatment group. For subject 
disposit
ion, demographic and baseline characteristics, medical 
histor
y, gastrointestinal disease history, and pr
ior medications, an 
overa
ll column (i.e., all subjects combined) will be included. For 
conti
nuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the number 
of subjec
ts, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and 
maxim
um values. For categorical va riables, de
scriptive statistics 
will include
 the number and percent of subjects in each category.  
 
All subjec
ts who meet the study entry inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
rec
eive at least one dose of study drug, and have at least one valid 
wee
k of efficacy as sessm
ent data (minimum of 4 days) will be 
included in t
he ITT analysis set. Subjects will be analyzed 
ac
cording to the treatment group into which they were 
randomi
zed. The ITT analysis set will be the primary analysis set 
for e
fficacy analysis.  
 
Re
sponder rat
e efficacy variables will be analyzed using a 
Coc
hran-Mant
el-Hae
nszel (CMH) test with pooled investigator 
site
 as a stratification (adjustment) variable. Summary statistics 
will include
 the pairwise risk difference with placebo along with 
the as
ymptotic  95% 
confidence interval (CI). The adjusted relative 
risk (a
djusted for pooled investigator site) will be based on the 
rati
o of responder rates for placebo versus tenapanor. The 95% CI 
versus plac
ebo will also be presented for the adjusted relative risk.  
Conti
nuous efficacy variables will be analyzed using an analysis 
of cova
riance (ANCOVA) or analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model.  The AN
COVA model will have terms for pooled 
investig
ator site, treatment group, and baseline as the covariate. 
The AN
OVA model w ill have
 terms for pooled investigator site 
and tre
atment group . The
 hypotheses will be based on the LS  
means di
fference from placebo.  
 
Sa
fety analyses will include summaries for adverse events, 
cli

UDY RATIONALE 
A major function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is to maintain intestinal 
water/sodium (Na+) homeostasis through a delicate balance of secretory and 
absorption mechanisms. The Na+/hydrogen (H+) antiporter NHE3 plays a dominant 
role in the Na+ re-uptake process. Tenapanor (also known as RDX5791 and 
AZD1722) is a GI-
acting NHE3 inhibitor. Tenapanor is a minimally systemic, small 
molecule under investigation for the treatment of constipation-related diseases such as 
chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), constipation predominant irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS-C), and opi[INVESTIGATOR_6919] (OBD). The proposed mechanism 
of action of tenapanor is to reduce Na+ re-uptake. This decrease in Na+ uptake 
increase
s the net fluid volume in the GI tract. Restoration of normal luminal fluid 
content facilitates intestinal transit and stimulates motility. 
This phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-
center study
 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tenapanor in subjects with 
constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) as defined by [CONTACT_6947] a two-week screening period.  Subjects who 
qualify and are randomized into the study will receive tenapanor [ADDRESS_5896]
bo BID for 26 consecutive weeks. 
2.1. Scientific Bac
kground 
2.1.1 Overview of IBS 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder seen by 
[CONTACT_6948]. These changes in bowel patterns may manifest as diarrhea, 
constipation or an alternation between the two. As there are no pathognomonic, 
laboratory, endoscopic or radiographic abnormalities found in association with IBS it 
is considered a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. The chronic nature of the 
multiple symptoms of IBS, combined with the lack of effective treatments, leads to 
significant health care resources being used by [CONTACT_6949]’ well-being and functional ability.  For research and regulatory purposes, th e 
diagnosis of IBS has been described by [CONTACT_6950] 14 (Appendix A) . 
2.2. Descrip
tion of Investigational Drug

 Dose Rationale 
Results from the Phase 2b study in IBS-C demonstrated that tenapanor 50 mg BID 
had statistically significant effects in the primary endpoint of CSBM responder rate 
with consistent effects in both overall and abdominal pain responder rates. Results 
from thi
s study also demonstrated that 20 mg BID (the next lowest dose) did not have 
statistically significant effects in key endpoints.  Based on results from this double-
blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 mg BID was selected as the dose for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_6921] 3 clinical trial.

ATIONAL PLAN 
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 
tenapanor in sub
jects with IBS-C.  Patients who are 18 to 75 years old, meeting the 
definition of IBS-C as defined by [CONTACT_6951] (see 
Appendix A ) wil
l undergo a battery of screening procedures to determine eligibility 
for the trial.  A 2:[ADDRESS_5901] to their  me
eting the eligibility requirements of the study.   
At the beginning of the 2-week screening period (Day -14), subjects will be 
questioned with respe
ct to their eligibility for the study.  Those that meet the basic 
requirements will be asked to provide written informed consent.  The basic screening 
assessments will include: evaluation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical 
history (including details about co-morbid disorders), physical exam, vital signs, 
ECG, and clinical laboratory tests, including urinalysis. Subjects must discontinue the 
use of all prohibited medications at Visit 1 (Screening/Day -14) for the duration of the 
study, as referenced in Section 5.6.  During the screening period, and starting on the 
evening of
 Study Visit 1, subjects will self-report daily information about the status of 
their IBS symptoms via a touch-tone telephone diary. Each day, entries into the 
telephone diary (IVRS diary) must occur between 6PM and 11:59PM (local time). 
This will include information about their stool frequency, stool consistency, straining, 
abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, abdominal fullness, 
abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and rescue medication usage. Additionally, on a weekly basis, 
the IBS severity and constipation severity will also be collected through the IVRS 
diary. Subject compliance with the electronic diary will be monitored actively by [CONTACT_6952].   
At the end of the screeni
ng period, prior to the subject returning for Visit 2 
(Randomization), a member of the site staff will confirm a subject’s eligibility with 
regard to the information they have reported in their electronic diary during screening.  
If the information captured in the diary deems them eligible, and they continue to 
meet the inclusion crite
ria at Visit 2, a member of the site staff will randomize the 
subject into a treatment group using an interactive web-response system (IW RS).  
Subjects will be ra
ndomized into a treatment group according to a computer-
generated central randomization schema. All subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study drug, with at least one valid week of efficacy assessment data will be included 
in the intention- to-treat (ITT) analysis set. All subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study drug will be included in all analyses of safety data.   
During the 26-week double-blind treatment period, subjects will continue to record 
daily and we
ekly assessments via a touch-tone telephone diary system as instructed. 
Subjects will be seen weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26 (D ays 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 
and 183) during the tr
eatment period.  Subject compliance with daily diary entries 
will be monitored on a
n ongoing basis by [CONTACT_6953]. Subject compliance

propylene ( CRC) closures with an induction seal plus desiccants.  Each bottle 
will c
ontain sixty-six (66) tablets. 
Tenapanor and placebo tablets should be stored in the original packaging between 
2°C a
nd 30°C. Temperature excursions are allowed from -30°C to 50°C for a 
maximum of 1 week. 
Each bottle will be labeled with a single panel, double blind label.   
6.3. Treatments to be Administered 
Study drug will be dispensed only to eligible subjects under the supervision of the 
Investigator or identified sub-Investigator(s).  Eligible subjects will be randomized 
1:1 into one of two treatment groups: tenapanor [ADDRESS_5913] dose should be taken immediately prior to dinner. 
Subjec
ts will receive one bottle of drug at Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 4 (Day 29 ± 3), Visit 
5 (Day 57 ± 3 days), Visit 6 (Day 85 ± 3 days), and Visit 7 (Day 113 ± 3 days) and 
two bott
les of drug at Visit 8 (Day 141 ± 3 days).  At each visit the subject will be 
aske
d to return their unused drug and bottles. Study drug compliance will be 
monitored closely by [CONTACT_6957]-site monitoring visits. 
6.4. Randomization and Blinding 
Both randomization and blinding techniques will be used in this study to minimize 
bias.  Randomization will occur at Visit 2 (Day 1).  A computer generated 
randomi
zation schema will be centrally available via an interactive web response 
system (IWRS) to all clinical centers that meet the requirements for participation in 
the study.  The IWR system can be accessed by a computer by [CONTACT_6958] a user ID and password.   
In order to double-blind the study, the study drug is labeled in a manner to ensure that 
neit
her investigators nor subjects can distinguish between treatments.   
In the case of a medical emergency where, in the Investigator’s judgment, the 
subject’s safety may be compromised without immediate knowledge of the exact 
treatment received, the Investigator can contact [CONTACT_6959].   
All reasonable effort should be made to reach the Medical Monitor prior to 
unblinding.  If the treatment is unblinded, the Investigator should immediately

fficacy Assessments 
8.3.1 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will be based on adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs, ECG, and phy
sical examinations,   
Incidence of adverse events and clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will 
be determined at the completion of the study.  This study will help characterize the 
safety and tolerability profile of tenapanor 50 mg BID in IBS-C subjects.   
Safety 
assessments are described below.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse eve
nts 
Monitoring of treatment emergent adverse events will be conducted throughout the 
study beginni
ng on Day 1 (Randomization).  Adverse events, including serious 
adverse events will be recorded in the eCRFs through the end of the study.  All 
adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_6961] a subject’s stable or chronic condition or concurrent 
illness(es).  Definitions, documentation, and reporting of adverse events are described 
in detail in Section 
9.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical histor
y and physical examination 
An abbreviated medical history will be obtained over the telephone at the time of the 
prescreening questionnaire (if performed) for the purpose of determining eligibility.  
A full medical history will be taken at Screening during Visit 1.  A complete physical 
examinati
on will be conducted during Visits 1 and 9 (and at any early termination 
visit).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Electroca
rdiogram 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram will be obtained during Visits 1, 6 and 9 (and at any 
early termination visit). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs 
Vital signs, including heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], sitting systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (SSBP, SDBP), temperature, and body weight will be obtained at all Visits.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical laboratory 
tests 
A central laboratory will perform clinical laboratory tests.  Blood samples will be 
drawn from subjects for
 serum chemistries and hematology at Visits 1, 4, [ADDRESS_5917] at Visits 1, 2 (pregnancy 
test only), 4, 6, and 9.  A FSH test will be performed, as appropriate at Visit 1.  See 
Appendix C  for spe
cific laboratory tests.   
Clinical laboratory test values that are considered abnormal will be noted as clinically 
significant or non-c
linically significant by [CONTACT_6962].  Clinical laboratory 
test values that are out o
f the normal limits are considered to be abnormal.   
Handling and shipment of clinical laboratory samples will be outlined in the Lab 
Manual.

fficacy Assessments 
Subjects will report efficacy assessments via an interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) utilizing a touch-tone telephone.  Efficacy assessments will be collected daily 
and we
ekly, unless otherwise specified, from the beginning of the screening period 
through the end of the treatment period.  The daily questions will include information 
about bowel movement frequency, completeness of bowel emptying, stool 
consistency, straining, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, 
abdominal fullness, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and use of rescue medications.  IBS 
severity and constipation severity will be collected weekly during the screening and 
trea
tment periods. Adequate relief of IBS symptoms and degree of relief of IBS 
sy
mptoms will be collected weekly during the treatment a period.  Treatment 
sa
tisfaction (Visits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 ) and IBS- QOL  (Visits 2, 6, and 9) will also be 
evaluated during the subjects' site visit. 
A script de
tailing the IVRS diary questions and scales will be supplied to the clinical 
site
 and to the subjects in the form of written subject information material.  The 
following questions will be asked to all subjects on a daily or weekly basis during the 
screening and treatment periods.

VERSE EVENTS 
9.1. Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered 
a pha
rmaceutical product, whether or not the occurrence has causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered 
related to the investigational product.  This includes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration 
of the investigational product.   
Worsening of IBS symptoms is not considered an adverse event unless the frequency 
and/or se
verity of the symptom(s) are outside of what the subject considers normal 
for their IBS.   
9.2. Severity 
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction).  Even though the event itself may 
be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache), this is not the 
same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria as 
described above and are usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  A severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For 
example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea 
but not meet the definition of a SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a 
minor degree of persistent disability may be considered mild, but would be defined as 
a SAE based on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
For both serious and non-serious adverse events, the Investigator must determine the 
severity of the event using the following definitions: 
Mild  The event does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s 
normal functioning level.  It may be an annoyance but does not cause any 
limitation in usual activity.   
Moderate  The event produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous 
to health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment and may cause some 
limitation in usual activity.   
Severe  The event produces significant impairment or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the subject’s health.   
9.3. Unexpected Adverse Drug Experience 
An unexpected adverse experience is any adverse drug experience, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current Investigator’s Brochure, or if an 
Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, which is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition refers to an

rse drug experience that has not previously been observed (e.g., included in the 
Investigator’s Brochure) rather than from the perspective of such an experience not 
being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   
9.4. Causality 
Association of adverse events to the study drug will be made using the following 
definitions:   
Not related:  The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
cli
nical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal relationship of the event to 
study drug administration makes a causal relationship unlikely 
Possibly-related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug  
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but 
could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical condition, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs  
Probably-related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time 
of dru
g administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs.  
9.5. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence, that at any 
dose, re
gardless of causality: 
 results in death. 
 is life-threatening.  Life threatening means that the subject was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form might have 
caused death.   
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations 
scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study 
entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the 
subject was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned). 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a persons’ ability to conduct normal 
life functions.   
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
 An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6931] a SAE when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject

events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. 
9.6. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs 
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, will be reported between Day 1 
(Randomization) and the final visit (up to Day 183, Visit 9).  Medical events that 
occur betwe
en the signing of the informed consent and the first dose of study drug 
will be documented as part of the subject’s medical history and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.   
All adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination 
or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  
Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory tests or other clinical finding is 
considered an adverse event and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the 
eCRF.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying 
pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event or diagnosis. 
All serious adver
se events occurring during the course of the study must b e 
reporte
d by [CONTACT_6968], or fax immediately to:   
 
 
 
 
In
 no even
t shall a SAE be reported more than twenty-four (24) hours after the 
Investigator becomes aware of such event.   The report of an SAE by [CONTACT_6969]: protocol number, 
subject number, subject’s initials and date of birth, nature of the adverse event and 
attributes such as the severity of the event and causality.  Events will be considered 
suspected adverse drug reactions if classified by [CONTACT_6970]-related 
or probably- related. 
A report of a SAE by [CONTACT_6971] a written, more detailed 
report within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  The SAE 
Reporting Forms are provided to each clinical study site in the Study Manual.  The 
Investigator should provide the following documentation at the time of notification, if 
available: 
SAE Reporting Form 
Concomitant and support medication pages; 
Relevant diagnostic reports; 
Relevant laboratory reports; 
Admission notes; if applicable

Ardelyx will assume responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to 
regulatory authorities.  Ardelyx will report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to all investigational sites.   
It is the r
esponsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of all SAEs, as well as any 
unanticipated problems that involve significant risk to subjects.  A copy of the 
IRB/IEC notification should be placed in the sites’ regulatory binder.   
9.7. Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation 
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, will be recorded on the eCRFs up to 
and including the final visit (Day 183, Visit 9).  All adverse events should be 
monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a subject’s 
stable or chronic condition or concurrent illness(es).   
Follow-up data concerning the SAE (e.g., diagnostic test reports, physician's 
summaries, etc.) must also be submitted to the Sponsor as they become available, 
preferably by [CONTACT_6972].  All serious adverse events, as well as any unanticipated 
problems that involve significant risk to subjects, must be promptly reported by [CONTACT_6973]/her Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Should the FDA or other 
pertinent regulatory authorities require that Ardelyx submit additional data on the 
event, the 
Investigator will be asked to provide those data to Ardelyx in a timely 
fashion.   
The Investigator will review each serious adverse event report and further evaluate 
the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug and to the subject’s underlying 
disease.  Based on the Investigator assessment of the adverse event, a decision will be 
made concerning the need for further action.  The primary consideration governing 
further action is whether new findings affect the safety of other subjects participating 
in the clinical study.  If the discovery of a serious and unexpected adverse event 
related to the study drug raises concern over the safety of its continued administration 
to subjects, the S
ponsor will take immediate steps to notify the FDA and other 
pertinent regulatory authorities and all Investigators participating in clinical studies of 
the study drug.   
Any serious adverse event that occurs at any time after completion of the study, 
which the Investigator considers to be related to study drug, must be reported to 
Ardelyx within forty-eight (48) hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event.

TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 
tenapa
nor in subjects with IBS-C.  Treatment to be administered consists of two 
treatment groups: placebo and tenapanor 50 mg twice daily (BID, total daily dose of 
100 mg) 
for [ADDRESS_5922] 600 subjects will be enrolled at 
approx
imately 100-120 US clinical centers.  Each center is expected to enroll 
approx
imately six (6) subjects, however, enrollment is competitive and centers will 
be allowed to enroll subjects beyond the expected site projection.. 
A forma
l statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed, finalized, and signed-off 
on prior to the database lock and unblinding of treatment assignment. This plan will 
confirm the analysis sets used in the analysis, outline all data handling conventions, 
and specify all statistical methods to be used for all safety and efficacy analyses. The 
SAP will pre-specify exploratory and sensitivity analyses as additions to analyses 
included in the protocol.  In particular, the primary analysis and key secondary 
analyses will remain the same. If after the data has been unblinded and additional 
analyses are implemented or planned analyses are changed, such deviations will be 
documente
d in the clinical study report. Any implications for the interpretation of the 
trial results will be addressed.  A set of table, listing, and figure shells will also be 
part of this plan for internal use.  Any changes to the statistical considerations 
described in Section 10 of this protocol will be addressed in the SAP and will not be 
part of a protocol amendment. 
10.1. Determination of Sample Size 
A sample size of 300 in each treatment group would achieve 95% power to detect a 
difference of 0.15 (15 %) between the placebo and tenapanor 50 mg BID 6/[ADDRESS_5923] 45% 
under the alternative hypothesis and the responder rate in the placebo group is no 
closer
 than 15% from tenapanor [ADDRESS_5924] statistic used was the two-sided 
Fisher
's exact test with significance level of 0.050 (5%).  This sample size also has 
80% power to detect an 11.6% difference in responder rates between the treatment 
groups when the responder rates are in the same range as above.  
10.2. Randomization and Stratification 
A computer generated randomization schema will be made available centrally to all 
clinical centers that meet the requirements for participation in the study via an 
interactive web response system (IWRS).  The IWRS can be accessed with a 
computer by [CONTACT_6975] a study-issued user ID and password implemented to 
limit access and document a user log.  The packaging and labeling of the study drug 
kits will be based on a separate drug packaging randomization schedule.  Upon 
satisfaction of the eligibility criteria, study site personnel will call into the IWRS and 
obtain permission to randomize the subject.  The IWRS will determine which drug 
package for the site to administer to the subject based on a randomization schedule 
where each treatment is allocated once using a block size of 4 within each study site. 
Henc
e, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_6976]/or partial block sizes randomized.

ysis Sets 
Safety Analysis Set: 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in all 
analyses of safety data.  Such subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment 
actually received. 
Intent to Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: 
All subjects who meet the study entry inclusion/exclusion criteria, receive at least one 
dose of study drug, and have at least one valid week of efficacy assessment data 
(minimum of 4 days) will be included in the ITT analysis set.  Subjects will be 
analyzed according to the treatment group into which they were randomized.  The 
ITT analysis set will be the primary analysis set for efficacy analysis. 
10.4. Procedures for Handling Missing Data 
      The primary analysis will be based on the observed data where weekly SBMs and 
CS
BMs will be standardized to 7-day frequencies. This amounts to missing days 
during the week being imputed with the mean for the non-missing days.  A valid 
week will require at least [ADDRESS_5925] to these items. However, the average weekly stool consistency 
and the average weekly straining score will be calculated on the observed number of 
responses without any standardization. For the purposes of calculating an average, 
days with no stools reported (i.e., a 0 was recorded for the answer to IVRS question 
6) will be scored as [ADDRESS_5926]’s endpoint values 
represents the last experience while receiving study drug during the first 12-weeks 
and the total 26-week treatment period.  
 
      Otherwise, all other observed data will be used in the analyses. 
10.5. Methods of Pooling Data 
      For the purpose of adjusting for investigator effects in statistical models, investigator 
sites will be pooled into groups based on geographic region and number of subjects 
enrolled with an aim for comparable sample sizes among pooled investigator sites. 
The goal of the pooling strategy will be to avoid less than a minimum number of 
subjects per pooled investigator site.  The size of a pooled investigator site would

nerally not be larger than the total number of subjects enrolled at the highest 
enrolling individual investigator site. The pooled investigator sites will be used in all 
applicable analyses where adjustment for investigator effect is desir ed.  
 B
ased on an average of 6 subjects per site to be enrolled, the primary pooled 
investigator site strategy will target 10 pools of approximately 60 subjects each 
(approximately 30 per treatment group per pooled investigator site). As a sensitivity 
analysis, a second pooling will have a target of 20 pools of approximately 30 subjects 
each (approximately 15 per treatment group per pooled investigator site). The actual 
designation of membership in a pooled investigator site cannot be made until the final 
enrollment quantities and final number of sites used is completed. The final pooling 
strategy will be defined before treatment unblinding, and will be provided as an 
addendum to the SAP. The goals stated above will be adhered to as closely as 
possible.  
10.6. Visit Windows 
      Daily IVRS diary data are planned for daily collection starting on the day of the 
Screening visit and continuing until the planned Week 26 (Visit 9 Day 183) visit. 
 
      Weekly IVRS diary data are planned for each week of the 2-week screening period 
(when applicable) and each week of the 26-week treatment period.  
 
      For a
ll IVRS efficacy data, the date collected will be used to calculate a relative study 
day (Rel Day). The relative study day will be calculated as the number of days from 
the day of first dose. The day of the first dose date is Day 1. The preceding day is Day 
-1, the day before that is Day -2, etc. There is no Day 0. 
 
      Actual study periods will be defined as follows for the purposes of the efficacy 
evaluations: 
 
 Screening/Baseline Period (Rel Days -14 through Day -1): For the average weekly 
CSBM s, average weekly SBMs, average weekly stool consistency, average weekly 
straining score, and average weekly abdominal symptom score (pain, discomfort, 
bloating, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and fullness), the most recent 7 days will be used to calculate 
Week -1 values (i.e., days -1 through -7) and remaining days will be used for Week - 2 
ca
lculations (i.e., day -8 through -14 or more if applicable). The baseline for these 
variables will then be based on the average of the week -2 and week -1 values. While 
the screening period may vary somewhat from 14 days, it will generally be required 
that subjects provide two weekly ratings of the weekly IVRS diary questions during 
this period.

      The number and percent of subjects in each analysis set will also be tabulated. 
10.7.2 Demographic and Background Characteristics 
      The treatment groups will be descriptively assessed for comparability of demographic 
and baseline characteristics. Variables included in this assessment will be the 
demographic characteristics of age at informed consent (years), gender, race, 
ethnicity, body weight (kg), and BMI (kg/m2). These variables will be summarized 
for each treatment group and overall. Screening values (week -1, week -2) and 
baseline values (average of week -1 and week - 2) for average weekly CSBMs, 
average weekly SBMs, average weekly stool consistency, average weekly straining 
score, and average weekly abdominal symptoms of pain, discomfort, bloating, 
fullness, and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_6933]. 
 
      Weekly ratings of IBS severity and constipation severity will also be summarized for

descriptive statistics will be used for the weekly ratings. 
   
      Medical history and gastrointestinal (GI) history will be summarized for the number 
and percentage of subjects for each body system by [CONTACT_6654]. 
Medical history includes verbatim terms recorded for the subjects. GI history includes 
duration (years) since IBS symptoms began before randomization, duration (months) 
since last colonoscopy before randomization, and whether colonoscopy findings are 
not significant. A summary table will be presented for each analysis set. Medical and 
GI history will also be listed. 
10.7.3 Prior/Concomitant Medication 
All prior and concomitant medications administered during the study will be coded

[CONTACT_1192], times the number of days during the treatment period, then multiplied by 100. 
10.7.5 Efficacy Variables 
Efficacy variables in this trial will be captured via the IVRS on a daily basis (CSBM 
frequency, SBM frequency, consistency, straining, and abdominal symptoms of pain, 
discomfort, bloating, fullness, and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) or weekly basis (IBS severity, and 
constipation severity) during the screening (baseline) period and the [ADDRESS_5929] 6/12 weeks where both CSBM and 
abdominal pain response criteria were met for the week. The CSBM and abdominal 
pain response criteria are defined below. The weekly overall responder rates will be 
summarized for each week of the treatment period. 
The CSBM response criteria are defined as a n increase of one or more change in 
average weekly CSBMs from baseline.  The definition of a CSBM is as follows: A 
CSBM is a SBM for which the subject responds “yes” to the following question; “Did 
you feel like you completely emptied your bowels?”  Any SBM which is preceded 
within [ADDRESS_5930] 
data reported for a given week (either due to a gap in reporting or due to 
discontinuation), the subject will be considered to be a non-responder for the week.  
A key secondary efficacy variable will be the overall CSBM responder rate. An 
overall CSBM responder will be defined as a weekly CSBM responder for the first 
6/[ADDRESS_5931] 4 days of SBM 
reporting. The average weekly CSBMs and change from baseline (where baseline is 
the average of the 2-weeks during the screening period) for each week of the 
treatment period will be summarized.   
The abdominal pain response criteria are defined as a decrease of 30% or more of

ent change from baseline in average weekly worst abdominal pain. Abdominal 
pain will be scored daily using the scale 0 = No pain to 10 = very severe pain. The 
average weekly abdominal pain score will be calculated as the average score for all 
days during a va lid week. Should a subject not have data reported for at least 4 days 
during a
 given week (either due to a gap in reporting or due to discontinuation), the 
subje
ct will be considered to be a non-responder for the week. The average weekly 
abdominal pain score and percent change from baseline (where baseline is the 
average of the 2-weeks during the screening period) for each week of the treatment 
period w
ill be summarized.   
A key
 secondary efficacy variable will be the overall abdominal pain responder rate. 
An overall abdominal pain responder will be defined as a weekly abdominal pain 
responder for the first 6/[ADDRESS_5932] of the overall responder rate, 
overall CSBM responder rate, and overall abdominal pain responder rate calculated 
using a 13/[ADDRESS_5933] met the responder criteria for the 6/[ADDRESS_5934] of the overall responder rate, 
overall CSBM responder rate, and overall abdominal pain responder rate calculated 
using a
 9/[ADDRESS_5935] met the responder criteria for the 6/[ADDRESS_5936] 9/12 week CSBM responder criteria, it is also required 
that the a
verage weekly CSBMs for the week are ≥3.  An additional set of key 
secondary efficacy variables consist of the durable overall responder rate, durable 
overall CSBM responder rate, and durable overall abdominal pain responder rate. The 
durable responder rates use the same first 9/[ADDRESS_5937] 3/[ADDRESS_5938] 12 weeks of the treatment period to meet the 
response criteria.  
For each of the efficacy variables described above (i.e., first 6/12, 13/26, first 9/12, 
and durable responders for the first 12 weeks), several sensitivity analyses will be 
done. Instead of assuming non-response for missing weeks or weeks with less than 4 
days of valid diary data, a sensitivity analysis will be carried out imputing response 
for these weeks. Similarly, instead of assuming a 30% reduction for percent change 
from baseline in abdominal pain, these analyses will be repeated using a 40% 
reduction and a 50% reduction as response criteria. Note that for these last 2 analyses, 
the CSBM responder analyses will not be repeated, only the overall and abdominal 
pain re
sponder rates.     
Secondary efficacy variables will include the following: 
The proportion of subjects with ≥ 3 CSBMs per week will be summarized for the 
baseline and treatment periods. 
Average weekly SBMs will be calculated as described above for average weekly 
CSBMs.  Change from baseline for each week of the 26-week treatment period will

average weekly abdominal symptom.   
IBS severity and constipation severity will be scored on a weekly basi s using the 
scale 1 = None, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe, 5 = Very Severe.  IBS severity 
scores and constipation severity scores for each week of the study will be summarized 
as categorical and continuous data. Observed data will be used for the summaries.   
Adequate relief of IBS symptoms (1 = yes, and 2 = no) will be asked on a weekly 
basis during the treatment period.  The percentage of subjects with adequate relief for 
each week of the study will be summarized using observed data. 
Degree of relief of IBS symptoms will be scored on a weekly basis during the 
treatment per

10.7.6 Efficac
y Analyses 
All efficacy variables involving responder rates or proportions will be analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with pooled investigator site as a stratification 
(adjustment) va
riable. Summary statistics will include the pairwise risk difference with 
placebo along with the asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI). The adjusted relative 
risk (adjusted for pooled investigator site) will be based on the ratio of responder rates for 
placebo versus tenapanor 50 mg BID. The 95% CI versus placebo will also be presented 
for the adjusted relative risk. 
All continuous efficacy variables derived from the daily IWRS questions (i.e., average 
weekly CSBMs, SBMs, stool consistency, straining score, abdominal symptoms of pain, 
discomfort, bloati
ng, fullness, and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), as well as the weekly IBS severity, 
constipation severity, and IBS QOL will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with terms for pooled investigator site, treatment, and baseline as the 
covariable.  Degree of relief of IBS symptoms and treatment satisfaction will be analyzed 
using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with terms for pooled investigator site 
and treatment.   
When the ANCOVA model is implemented, the least square means (LSmeans) will be 
presented for the actual values and change/percent change from baseline values for each 
treatment group with the 95% CI. Statistical testing will only be carried out using the 
change/percent change from baseline since the p-values are the same between the two 
analyses.  The LSmean difference versus placebo will also be presented with the 95% CI. 
When the ANOVA model is implemented, all of the above statistics will be presented for 
the actual values.
 
A sequential testing procedure will be utilized to control the experiment wise Type I error 
rate for the primary efficacy variable. Because of the desire to also pre-specify key 
secondary efficacy variables, the sequential testing procedure will not inflate the overall 
5% level. The primary efficacy variable will be tested at the 5% level of significance.  If 
this test is significant, the first key secondary efficacy variable listed in Table 10-1 will 
be tested at the 5% level. If this test is significant, then the next variable is tested at the 
5% level. This procedure continues until one of the tests in the list results in a p-value 
>5%.  Variables up to this point in the list will be declared statistically significant.  
Interpretation of p-values for the secondary efficacy variables will be descriptive.   
In addition to the summaries of the efficacy variables described, figures will be provided 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_6937]/percent change from baseline for each treatment 
group at each assessment time. A secondary analysis will also include graphs depi[INVESTIGATOR_6938].

MINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 
11.1. Good Clinical Practice 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current GCP/ICH Guidelines and 
relevant regulatory requirement(s).  Compliance with this standard provides public 
assurance that the rights, safety and we ll-being of trial subjects are protected; consistent 
with the
 principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that the 
clinical trial data are credible.  The Investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the 
appropriate use of the study drug as described in the protocol and Investigator’s 
Brochure.  Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of 
the study and the integrity of the data collected.  A Trial Master File will be established at 
the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the trial and retained according 
to appropria
te regulations. 
11.2. Ethical Considerations 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study 
documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well-being of the subjects.  
The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.  
The protocol, Investigator Brochure, informed consent, advertisements (if applicable), 
written information given to the subjects (including subject information material), 
safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be 
provided to the IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_737]. 
11.3. Subject Informed Consent and Information 
Prior to entry in the trial, the Investigator must explain to potential subjects or their 
legally acceptable representative, the trial and the implications of participation.  
Subjects will be told that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw 
consent to participate at any time.  Subjects will be told that competent authorities 
and authorized Ardelyx personnel, its business partners or its CRO designee may 
access their records without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) and/or regulations.  By [CONTACT_6984] (ICF) the subject or legally acceptable representative is authorizing 
such access through an authorization meeting the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  Each subject (or their legally 
authorized representative) that wants to participate in the study must sign and date the 
IC
F (and other locally required documents) after the nature of the study has been fully 
explained prior to performing any study-related activities.  The subject (or their

that were seen to determine eligibility for inclusion in the trial will also be completed 
by [CONTACT_737].  
11.4. Subject Confidentiality 
The collection and processing of data from subjects enrolled in this trial will be 
limi
ted to those data that are necessary to investigate the safety, quality and utility of 
the investigational product(s) used in this trial.  These data will be processed with 
adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality. 
In order to maintain subject/subject privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability 
records, study reports and communications will identify the subject by [CONTACT_6987].  The Investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from 
Ardelyx, its designee(s) and regulatory authority(ies) access to the subject’s original 
medical records for verification of data gathered on the CRFs and to audit the data 
collection process.  The subject’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be 
made publicly available except to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6988]. 
11.5. Protocol Compliance 
The Investigator will conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol provided by 
[CONTACT_6989], and given approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the appropriate regulatory 
authority(ies).  Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement 
of both the Investigator and Ardelyx.  Changes to the protocol will require written 
IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation, except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects.  The IRB/IEC may provide, if 
applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval for minor 
change(s) in ongoing trials that have the approval of the IRB/IEC.  Ardelyx will 
submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with 
the governing regulations.   
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to subjects, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_6989], if circumstances permit, 
to discuss the planned course of action.  
11.6. Study Monitoring and On-site Audits 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_6990]

documents, CRFs, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection.  
Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_737], who must 
provide support a
t all times for these activities. 
11.7. Case Report Form Completion 
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for this study.  Electronic 
case report forms (eCRFs) will be accessed for each subject.   
eC
RFs will be completed for each screened and randomized study subject.  It is the 
Inv
estigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of 
the data reported in the subject’s eCRF.  Source documentation supporting the eCRF 
data should indicate the subject’s participation in the trial and should document the 
dates and details of study procedures, adverse events and subject status.   
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF pages as 
soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a 
study subject is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure.  
Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination.  
An explanation should be given for all missing data.   
Prior to submission within the EDC system, eCRFs must be reviewed for 
compl
eteness and accuracy, and electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_6991]. 
11.8. Drug Accountability/Retention  
Accountability for the study drug at the trial site is the responsibility of the 
Investigator.  The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in 
accordance with this protocol.  Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign 
some of the drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate 
individual.  Drug accountability records indicating the study drug’s delivery date to 
the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6992], and return to Ardelyx (or disposal 
of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_6989]) will be maintained by [CONTACT_977].  These 
records will adequately document that the subjects were provided the doses as 
specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from Ardelyx.  
Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_6939] (if applicable), and subject numbers.  Ardelyx or its CRO designee will review 
drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis during on-site monitoring visits. 
The Investigator acknowledges that the study drug supplies are investigational and as 
such must be handled strictly in accordance with the protocol and container label.  
Supplies should be dispensed under the supervision of the Investigator or designee.  
Study drug will be stored in a limited access area and under the appropriate 
conditions as specified on delivery.   
Unused or partially used bottles of study drug will be stored until the study monitor at

PPENDIX A: Rome III Criteria for the Diagnosis of IBS 
 
Diagnostic
 Criteria* 
Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort** at least [ADDRESS_5943] 3 months 
associated with 2 or more of the following: 
 
1. Improvement with defecation 
2. Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool 
3. Onse
t associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool 
 
*Criteria fulfilled for the last [ADDRESS_5944] 6 months prior to 
diagnosis. 
**Discomfort means an uncomfortable sensation not described as pain. In pathophysiology 
research and clinical trials, a pain/discomfort frequency of at least [ADDRESS_5945] eligibility.  
Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include abnormal stool 
frequency ([a] ≤ 3 bowel movements per week or [b] ≥3 bowel movements per day), 
abnormal stool form ([c] lumpy/hard stool or [d] loose/watery stool), [e] defecation straining, 
[f] urgency, or also a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating. 
 
Subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_6941]: 
 IBS with constipation (IBS-C): hard or lumpy stoolsa ≥25% and 
loose (mushy) or watery stoolsb <25% of bowel movements 
 IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D): loose (mushy) or watery stoolsb ≥25% 
 and hard or lumpy stoola <25% of bowel movements. 
 Mixed IBS (IBS- M): hard or lumpy stoolsa ≥25% and loose 
(mushy) or watery stoolsb ≥25% of bowel movements. 
 Unsubtyped IBS—insufficient abnormality of stool consistency to 
meet criteria for IBS-C, D, or Mc. 
The validity and stability of such subtypes over time is unknown and should be the subject of 
future research. 
aBristol Stool Form Scale 1–2 (separate hard lumps like nuts [difficult to pass] or sausage 
shaped but lumpy). 
bBristol Stool Form Scale 6–7 (fluffy pi[INVESTIGATOR_6927], a mushy stool or watery, no 
solid pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], entirely liquid).

2.1 Rationale for Study Design, Cont rol Group, and Dose Selection 
2.1.1 Rationale for Dose Selection 
The dose (80 mg/kg/week for 48 weeks) for this study was based on the successful treatment of 
patients at 80 mg/kg/week in  Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 for up to a total of 24 weeks of 
treatment, as well as in th e Phase 1/2 Study NS-065/NCPN-0 1-P1/2 conducted in Japan 
(Japan P1/2).  Results are detailed below.   
Viltolarsen dystrophin levels and exon ski ppi[INVESTIGATOR_233494] P1/2 
(Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) and Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201.  The results are summarized 
below: 
1. Highest dystrophin production measured by [CONTACT_233529] 20 to 24 weeks in both 
Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2 [n = 4]) and Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 (n = 8) 
was observed at 80 mg/kg. 
2. Average dystrophin production by [CONTACT_233530] 24 weeks in 
Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) was higher at 80 mg/kg (n = 4). 
3. Average dystrophin production by [CONTACT_233531] 45-52 mutati on measured by 
[CONTACT_233532] 20 to 24 weeks in both Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) and 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 (n = 3)  was higher at 80 mg/kg. 
a. Dystrophin production by [CONTACT_233533] 45-52 mutation was lower than patients 
with other mutation types in both Japan P1/2 (Study NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) (n = 4) 
and Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 (n = 8) at both 40 and 80 mg/kg. 
4. Average dystrophin production by [CONTACT_233534] 20 to 24 weeks 
in Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 was higher at 80 mg/kg (n = 8). 
5. Average % of dystrophin positive fiber by [CONTACT_233535]-065/NCNP-01-201 was hi gher at 80 mg/kg (n = 8). 
6. Average exon skippi[INVESTIGATOR_233495] (RT-PCR) in both Japan P1/2 (NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) and Study 
NS-065/NCNP-01-201 was higher at 80 mg/kg. 
7. Safety profiles were comparable in bo th Japan P1/2 (NS065/NCNP01-P1/2) and 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 between 40 and 80 mg/kg. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 25 of 117 Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 and Study NS- 065/NCNP-01-202 (extension study for 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201) have en rolled a total of [ADDRESS_281854] been no apparent drug-related serious  adverse events (SAEs)  reported, and no adverse 
events (AEs) led to study drug di scontinuation.  One SAE (left tibi a/fibula fracture that required 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101985], not-related to drug) was reported in June 2018.   
In summary, the dose of 80 mg/kg/week fo r 48 weeks is supported based on dystrophin 
production at 80 mg/kg/week and safety profile (w ell-tolerated for 168 week s) in the 2 studies 
(Japan P1/2 [NS065/NCNP01-P1/2] and St udy NS-065/NCNP-01-201) conducted to date. 
2.1.[ADDRESS_281855] patient  safety and quality of life in 
daily life. 
There is an unmet need for sa fe and efficacious treatments fo r Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
(DMD); to date there is 1 marketed e xon 53 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_231505] (Vyondys 53 [Golodirsen], 
SRP-4053, Sarepta Therapeutics).  The ongoing gl obal Phase 3 study (Clinical Study Protocol: 
NS-065/NCNP-01-301) has an age range  of 4 to <8 years.  Therefor e, this study will investigate 
safety and tolerability of viltolars en for patients with DMD who are 8 years of age.  
2.1.3 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
For the comparator to assess th e secondary endpoint,  the natural history group is referred.  
Although the sponsor understands the complexity in interpreti ng an open-label study with a 
natural history, external compar ator control group due to the heterogeneity of the disease 
progression in DMD, an open-label historic al control study was designed to account for 
beneficence, ethics, and the inhe rent difficulty to enroll a placebo-controlled study after an 
accelerated approval is granted in the [LOCATION_002] (US). 
2.1.4 Rationale for Study Duration of 56 Weeks 
Individual patient study duration is approximately 56 weeks, whic h takes into consideration the 
feasibility of patient enrollment and retention. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 26 of 117 2.2 Disease and Treatment 
2.2.1 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy – Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233496]/Biochemical Basis 
DMD is a disorder of progressive weakness leadi ng to severe disability and ultimately death 
caused by a deficiency of the dystrophin protein.  The reported prevalence of DMD is 15.9 cases 
per 100,000 live male births in the US and 19.5 cas es per 100,000 live male births in the United 
Kingdom ( Ryder et al, 2017 ; Mendell et al , 2012 ; Moat et al, 2013 ).  The symptoms of DMD are 
often first noted at about [ADDRESS_281856] year of life.  Proximal leg weak ness impairs mobility and precludes the ability to 
run or to rise from a squatting position.  Comple te loss of ambulation follows, with a progressive 
decline of upper extremity strength and function.  Declines in respi[INVESTIGATOR_233497],  ultimately culminating in early lethality 
(Birnkrant et al, [Part 1], 2018 ; Birnkrant et al, [Part 2], 2018 ).  The impact of this debilitating 
condition on those affected by [CONTACT_233536].  
The biochemical basis of DMD is the absence of  a functional dystrophin protein in striated 
muscle tissue that is essential for healthy muscle  function and muscle fibe r integrity.  In normal 
striated muscle the cytoplasmic dystrophin protein links intracellular actin w ith the extracellular 
matrix to provide structural stab ility of the muscle cell membrane.  In the majority of patients 
with DMD, dystrophin protein is not produced becau se of out-of-frame mutations characterized 
by a deletion of one or more e xons from the dystrophin gene, whic h is located on the short arm 
of the X chromosome.  Dystrophin mutations in  which some dystrophin pr otein function remains 
are associated with a similar but often milder phenotype, classified as Becker muscular 
dystrophy (BMD).  DMD and BMD exhibi t X-linked recessive inheritance. 
2.2.2 Current Natural History, Disease Manage ment, and Treatment Recommendations 
The Cooperative International Neuromuscular Re search Group (CINRG) conducted the largest 
prospective multicenter natural history study to date in DMD, the CINRG DMD Natural History 
Study (DNHS) ( McDonald et al, 2013 ; Henricson et al, 2013 ; McDonald et al, 2018 ).  The study 
included >400 boys and men with DMD, with va riable amounts of l ongitudinal follow-up over 
the course of a decade (2006 to 2016).  The study had annual follow-up visits that included timed 
function tests, muscle strength, functional assess ment questionnaires, pulm onary function tests, 
and quality of life assessments.   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

through all stages of the disease.   To date, treatments focus on  optimizing strength and function 
through the use of pharmacologica l interventions, physical ther apy, and assistive and adaptive 
devices. 
2.2.3 Glucocorticoid Treatment 
At present, treatment with glucocorticoid  (GC) medication is the only pharmacological 
intervention that has been shown to slow the decl ine of strength and function in DMD patients.  
The two main GCs used in DMD are prednisone  and deflazacort (EMF LAZA™).  Daily oral 
administration of prednisone or deflazacort stabi lizes or improves muscle strength and prolongs 
ambulation ( Drachman et al, 1974 ; Brooke et al, 1987 ; Griggs et al, 1993 ; Mendell et al, 1989 ; 
Griggs et al, 1991 ; Fenichel et al, 1991 ).  The mechanism by [CONTACT_192236] h GCs are beneficial in 
dystrophin deficiency is likely multifactoria l, including anti-inflammatory actions.  The 
immunosuppressive effects of GC s may not be beneficial, and other immunosuppressants have 
not shown benefit (Griggs et al, 1993 ).  On 09 February 2017, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved EMFLAZA™ for th e treatment of patients 5 years of age and 
older with DMD.   
In 2005, the American Academy of Neurology issued a practi ce parameter regarding GC 
treatment in DMD and recommended that GC should be offered as treatment, despi[INVESTIGATOR_233498] ( Moxley et al, 2005 ).  The significant side effects of  GCs include Cushingoid features, 
adverse behavioral changes, wei ght gain, growth retardation, in creased risk for bone fractures, 
gastritis, cataracts, hypertension, susceptibility to infe ction, and masking of response to stress 
(Matthews et al, 2016 ). 
2.2.4 Dystrophin Restoring Interventions

deletion can be enlarged to include the adjacent exon such that the resul ting deletion is in-frame 
(Kole et al, 2015 ).  
This new type of treatment could potentially treat 80% of DMD patients who have large-scale 
deletion or duplication mutati ons in the dystrophin gene ( Aartsma-Rus et al, 2009 ).  The full 
characterization of DMD patient mutations and further development of the technology will be 
crucial to fully realize these novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_180113]. 
Three oligonucleotides , Eteplirsen (Exondys 51®), Golodirsen (VYONDYS 53®), and 
Viltolarsen (VILTEPSO™), received accelerated approval fro m the US FDA based on increased 
dystrophin expression in treated pa tients.  Viltolarsen also rece ived accelerated approval from 
the Pharmaceutical and Medica l Devices Agency in Japan.  They are phosphorodiamidate 
morpholino oligomers (PMOs) ( Mendell et al, 2013 ; Clemens et al, 2020 ; Frank et al, 2020 ).  
Eteplirsen (Exondys 51®), approved by [CONTACT_3955] 19 Septem ber 2016, targets exon 51 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
with dystrophin increase of ~0.4% after 48 week s of treatment and ~ 0.9% after 188 weeks of 
treatment ( Charleston et al, 2018 ).  Golodirsen (VYONDYS 53®), approved by [CONTACT_3955] 
12 December 2019, targets exon 53 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], with dystr ophin increase of 0.9% after 48 weeks of 
treatment.  Viltolarsen (VILTEPSO™), approved by [CONTACT_3955] [ADDRESS_281858] 2020, also targets 
exon 53 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], with dystrophin increase of 5.3% after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment.  These 
drugs now need to provide supporting data that they slow disease progression as measured by 
[CONTACT_233538].   
Casimersen (a PMO under development) target s exon 45 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], with dystrophin increase of 
0.8% after 48 weeks of treatment.  A placebo-cont rolled global Phase 3 study of golodirsen and 
casimersen is currently ongoing.  
A dose-finding safety clinical  study is being conducted with  SRP-5051, a peptide conjugate 
PMO targeting exon 51.  Although SRP-5051 improves tissue uptake, it is known to be toxic. 
2.3 Background on Viltolarsen 
Viltolarsen is a novel antisense oligonucleotid e for the treatment of DMD, which has been 
discovered jointly by [CONTACT_233539] (NCNP), which is a National [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

exon/intron splicing patterns.  The mechanism of action is for viltolarsen to bind to a specific 
sequence in or near exon 53 of  the dystrophin pre-RNA transc ript and block the exon/intron 
splicing of exon 53, leading to mature mRNA tran scripts that lack exon 53.  Viltolarsen is 
thought to be effective on DMD patients with exon deletions amenable to skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180114] 53 
such as 43-52, 45-52, 47-52, 48-52, 49-52, 50-52, or 52.  The loss of exon 53 restores the mRNA 
reading frame, thus converti ng a DMD (out-of-frame) deletion mutation to a Becker-like 
(in-frame) deletion mutation.  In -frame deletion mutations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_233501] a shortened dystrophin protein, although the resulting Becker-like dystrophin 
protein will be smaller in mo lecular weight compared to the normal dystrophin protein, and 
likely lower in abundance (quant ity) compared to normal muscle, and thus may have lower 
function than normal amounts of  wild-type dystrophin protein. 
2.3.2 Summary of Nonclinical Findings 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacology 
Viltolarsen (0 to 10 μmol/L) demonstrated sustained e xon [ADDRESS_281860] 2 weeks in  cells from a DMD patient with deletion of exons 45-52 and in 
cells from a DMD patient with deletion of e xons 48-52.  In cynomolgus  monkeys, a dose of 
60 mg/kg viltolarsen resulted in  exon 53 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_233502] a 12-w eek intermittent intravenous (IV) toxicity study.

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 30 of 117 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic analyses revealed no apparent species differences for 
viltolarsen.  None of the in vitro  or in vivo  metabolism studies showed any distinct evidence of 
metabolism of viltolarsen.  After IV administration, time of maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) occurred at the first sampling time after the in jection or at the end of  the infusion for mice, 
rats, and monkeys.  C max and area under the curve (AUC) increased with dose, and most 
increases were approximately pr oportional to dose, with some in creases being greater than dose 
proportional.  For rats, the mean values for the terminal elim ination half-life (t 1/2) were 1.19, 
1.19, and 10.5 hours for 6, 20, and 60 mg/kg, respectivel y.  For monkeys, the mean values for t 1/2 
ranged from 1.7 to 3.5 hours.  For mice and monk eys, exposure did not change with 12 or 
13 weeks of repeat dosing. 
The fraction of viltolarsen bound to rat, m onkey, and human serum proteins was low, 40%, for 
all species and was independent of  concentration.  The distributi on of viltolarsen into red blood 
cells was 2.5%, 6.7%, and 3.5% for rat, monkey, and huma n, respectively, indicating low 
distribution of viltolar sen to red blood cells.  Quantitativ e whole-body autoradiography studies 
showed wide tissue distribution of [14C] viltolarsen in both mice a nd monkeys, with the highest 
concentrations observed in the kidney, and general distribution to muscle tissues.  For both rats 
and monkeys, renal excretion was the major route of eliminat ion, with less than 10% in the feces.  
No radioactivity was in the expi [INVESTIGATOR_180116].  Most of  the radioactivity was excreted 
within the first 24 hours.  Howeve r, small measurable amounts continued to be excreted in the 
urine and feces throughout th e 7-day collection periods.  
Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to cyto chrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (inhibition constant [K i] 
value: 1.44 mmol/L), while no inhibitory eff ects were observed to other CYPs (CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 ).  Viltolarsen did not induce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.  Viltolarsen s howed weak inhibition to UGT1A1 (K i value: 
0.642 mmol/L), while no inhibitory effects were  observed to UGT2B7.  Viltolarsen was not a 
substrate of transporters  (P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K).  
Viltolarsen showed weak inhibition to OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, and BCRP (respective

[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology 
Histopathological evaluations foll owing a single IV dose of 600 mg/kg in monkeys resulted in 
vacuolation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_233503].  No other renal changes were noted.  
Repeated administration of viltol arsen via the clinically relevant  route of administration (weekly 
IV injections) in mice, rats, and monkeys resu lted in decreases in red blood cell parameters, 
increased values for cytokines, and histopathologi cal effects in the kidney and urinary bladder.  
The kidney is the primary target organ in mice, rats, and monkeys, as shown by [CONTACT_233540] (1 000 mg/kg in 4-, 13-, and 26-week 
mouse studies; 500 mg/kg in 4- and 13-week rat studi es; and 600 mg/kg in a 12-week monkey 
study) and by [CONTACT_233541] ( 240 mg/kg in 4-, 13-, and 
26-week mouse studies; 250 mg/kg in 4- and 13 -week rat studies; and 200 mg/kg in 12- and 
39-week monkey studies) accompanied by [CONTACT_180164].  An additional 
histopathological finding in a 26-week mouse study was the presence of cytoplasmic 
eosinophilic material in the transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_180117] 60 mg/kg.  An 
increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was observed in all toxicity studies with all species, 
mainly at the higher doses.  Th e main causes of an increase in BUN are high protein diet, 
decrease in glomerular filtra tion rate (GFR) (suggestive of re nal failure) and in blood volume 
(hypovolemia), congestive heart fa ilure, gastrointestinal hemorr hage, fever, and increased 
catabolism.  In the toxicity studies with vilto larsen, BUN increases were considered to be 
attributable to a decrease in GFR.  Based on th ese data, the no observed adverse effect levels 
(NOAELs) were concluded to be 60 and 15 mg/kg in 13- and 26-week mouse studies, 
respectively, and 60 mg/kg in 12-  and 39-week monkey studies.  
Results from in vitro  and in vivo  genotoxicity studies were ne gative, and studi es showed no 
evidence of chromosomal aberrations. 
In a study of the effects of viltolarsen on fertility and early em bryonic development to 
implantation by [CONTACT_233542], no  toxicologically signifi cant changes were noted 
in copulation rate, copulatory interval, fertility rate, necr opsy, organ weights (testes or [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

implantation rate, preimplantati on loss rate, number of live embryos, embryonic viability rate, 
number of postimplantation losses, or postimpla ntation loss rate.  The NOAELs of viltolarsen 
were 240 mg/kg for general toxicity (based  on increases in BUN) and 1000 mg/kg for 
reproductive function and early embryonic development (no cha nges observed at the highest 
tested dose). 
Viltolarsen administered to juvenile male mice ( from PND7) (subcutaneous [SC] or IV) at doses 
up to 2000 mg/kg once-weekly (up to 4 weeks) or up to 1200 mg/kg once-weekly (up to 
10 weeks) suggested tolerability up to 240 mg/kg,  after which evidence of toxic effects to the 
kidney were observed (tubular degeneration, basoph ilia, and vacuolation and chronic progressive 
nephropathy in the kidneys at 240 mg/kg).  The NOAEL for general toxicity of viltolarsen is 
60 mg/kg, and for bone growth/geometry and ju venile neurotoxicity of viltolarsen is 
1200 mg/kg.  No toxicity specific to juvenile animals was noted. 
IV injections of 200 mg/kg showed acceptable local tolerances in cynomolgus monkeys, but 
600 mg/kg IV injections induced si gns of inflammation at the injection site into SC tissue.  
Similarly, intramuscular injec tions of 100 mg/kg were not su itable for administration of 
viltolarsen, showing inflammation of the injection site. 
No anti-viltolarsen antibodies were  detected in the 4-, 13-, or 26-week mouse studies, or in a 
39-week monkey study.  Anti-viltolars en antibodies were detected in 1 male at 200 mg/kg in a
12-week monkey study and 1 male at 500 mg/kg in a 13-week rat study.  However, antibody
detection was not considered to affect the toxicological evalua tion in this study, since skippi[INVESTIGATOR_233504] e nd of the treatment period and no
remarkable alteration in exposure to viltola rsen was observed after repeated dosing.
No toxicological differences were noted between lots of viltolarsen produced from an initial 
solid phase and the new liquid phas e (LP2, LP2) synthetic process. 
Viltolarsen was administered once weekly for 26 weeks at a dose level of 0 (vehicle: 
physiological saline), 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg (51 mice per group) to male 
CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic mice via IV route with a bolus injection.  After the terminal necropsy, 
macroscopic examinations showed a mass and/or thickening in 1 side  of the ureter in 1 mouse at [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

subsequent histopathological examinations on these 3 mice, transitional cell carcinoma was 
noted.  Histopathological examination of the ureters for the other mice was conducted and no 
further tumorigenic changes were identified.  Additionally, no treatment-related tumors were 
noted in any other organs.  The blood concen tration of viltolarsen in mice who received 
50 mg/kg/week was lower than the blood concentrati on of viltolarsen expect ed in human patients 
who will receive 80 mg/kg/week. 
2.3.3 Summary of Clinical Findings 
A Phase 1 investigator-initiat ed study (Study NCNP/DMT01) ( ClinicalTrials.gov: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) of viltolarsen injection was conducted in  DMD patients (aged 5 to 18 years) to 
investigate the overall usefulness of viltolarsen injection in the treatment of DMD, based on 
evaluations of safety, ex ploration of predictive markers of tr eatment response, and assessment of 
PK.  A total of 10 DMD patients were enrolled  and randomized.  IV infusion of viltolarsen

Moreover, neither SAEs nor incidences of Common Terminology Crite ria for AEs (CTCAE) 
version 4.0-JCOG (Japanese translation, publishe d by [CONTACT_233543]) Grade 
3 (severe) or worse were reported.  
Among the mild and moderate AEs, an increase in  beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (Grade 1) 
was found in all patients in both Cohorts 1 and 2 (Cohort 1 [n = 3], Cohort 2 [n = 3]) and in all 
but 1 patient in Cohort 3 (Cohort 3 [n = 4]).  
Initially, testing appeared to reve al proteinuria in 8 of 10 patients.   However, it was subsequently 
determined that there was a cross reaction between viltolarsen and the pyrogallol red dye-binding 
method, which was used for urinary protein measur ement, resulting in a fa lse positive result for 
protein in the 24-hour pooled urine samples.  To evaluate the 24-hour pooled urine samples for 
protein, the Coomassie brilliant bl ue method was used to remeasur e urinary protein in the frozen 
urine samples.  None of the retested samples sh owed urinary protein leve ls exceeding the normal 
range of the institution (i.e., 31.2 to 120 mg/day ).  Current studies ut ilize a urine protein 
benzethonium chloride method, using reagents that do not cross react with viltolarsen.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

The 24-hour pooled urine samples di d not show increased levels of albumin.  Spot measurements 
of urinary albumin were positive in 7 patients (Grade 1).  
Interleukin (IL) levels were increased (Grade 1)  in the serum in 6 out of 10 patients (high IL-[ADDRESS_281863]), and some level

2.4.1 Viltolarsen 
There were no important identifie d risks of viltolarsen in the current clinical development 
program.  Identified important potential risks from nonclinical studies were renal disorder, 
hepatic dysfunction, anemia, drug allergy, and immune activation.  No serious adverse reactions 
were recognized in the reporting period of th e current Drug Safety Update Report (14 May 2019 
to 13 May 2020), and there were no actions taken for safety reasons, or any significant changes 
in the IB. 
At present, none of the safety ri sks identified during the current reporting period were considered 
to be important risks.  Further, nonclinical a dverse effects previously identified as important 
potential risks have not been  observed in any of the human  studies conducted to date. 
2.4.2 Procedures 
Risks due to study-related procedures are detailed below. 
Blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, a nd PK is associated with the usual risks of 
a blood draw which include pain, bruising at th e point where the blood is taken, redness and 
swelling of the vein, infection, a nd a rare risk of fainting.  In order to decrease any of these 
possible risks the sites will employ pediatric tr ained staff and will use a numbing cream, if 
desired by [CONTACT_102], to reduce the risk of pain. 
Function and strength tests will be performed during this study.  These include the Brooke and 
Vignos scales, Performance of Upper Limb (PUL ), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), 
and hand-held dynamometer.  All te sts are associated with muscle  soreness, fatigue, and falls. 
Quantitative muscle strength by [CONTACT_35681]-held dynamome ter may cause fatigue and muscle soreness. 
While wearing the ActiGraph GT9x on the wrist, there is a small risk for discomfort or redness at 
the wear site.  Padding will be provided and patien ts will be instructed to remove the ActiGraph 
if they experience any discomfort (i.e., redness,  irritation, pressure points) and contact [CONTACT_233546].

5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 2, open-label study with DMD boys  receiving 80 mg/kg v iltolarsen administered 
IV at weekly doses in ambulant and non-ambulant boys [ADDRESS_281868] Dosing 
The dose per patient (in milligra ms) will be calculated based on body weight in kilograms, 
collected per the protocol.  Details of dose prep aration can be found in the study Investigational 
Product Information Manual (IPIM).  Doses will be  administered by [CONTACT_233547] a 1-hour 
period.  All missed or incomplete doses will be  documented.  The dispensed investigational 
product (IP) vials will be stored at the research  site until drug accountability is verified by [CONTACT_233548].   
In the event it becomes necessary, or at the discretion of the pare nt/guardian, in consultation with 
the investigator and consulti ng surgeon and following adequa tely informed and voluntary 
patient/guardian consent and child assent, a to tally implantable central venous access device 
(TICVAD) may be used, continge nt upon approval by [CONTACT_123356]/or  country-specific regulatory 
body(ies).  Implantable central venous access (CVA)  ports will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for patients who experience difficulty with peripheral venous access.  Discussions 
regarding implantable ports  for patients will include  the study site investig ator, medical monitor, 
and sponsor.  Before final decision, NS Phar ma, Inc. will obtain documentation from the 
investigator that the consulting surgeon who w ill place the port holds hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180120] a

[CONTACT_093], sponsor, and medical monitor wi ll continue throughout the Treatment Phase for 
all study visits, regardless of whether the infusion occurs at the st udy site or the home.  
Furthermore, the investigator will be responsible  for immediate contact [CONTACT_233555], regardless of whether the infusion occurs at  the study site or the home. 
Home infusions will only be considered starting at  the Week 6 study visit or after.  Visits with 
additional assessments (Weeks 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 37, 48, and 49 [or early ter mination]) should be 
conducted at the prima ry study site.   
9.2 Informed Consent 
Each patient and/or patient’s pare nt or legal guardian will receive an explanation of the nature 
and purposes of the study from the investigator or  designee.  The investigator or designee will 
ensure the study is appropriate for the patient.  Consent must be obtained in accordance with the 
principles outlined in the current version of the D eclaration of Helsinki.  The patient or patient’s 
parent or guardian (if patient is  a minor) will confirm that s/he understands that the study is for 
research purposes only and that it may not provide any therapeutic  benefit to the individual.  
Each patient and patient’s parent or guardian (if patient is a minor) will confirm that s/he 
understands that the patient is fre e to withdraw from the study at  any time without prejudice.  
The investigator or designee will review the elements of the HIPAA and Protected Health 
Information (PHI) with each pati ent and/or patient’s parent or guardian and each patient and/or 
patient’s parent or guardian will confirm that s/he understands HIPAA authorization and PHI.  
The investigator (or designated staff) will obt ain the written informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization on the approved in formed consent form (ICF) by [CONTACT_233556] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Commi ttee (IEC) at each site, from the patient or 
patient’s parent or guardian (i f the patient is a minor) prior to any study-related procedures, 
including agreement for discontinuation of any prohibited medi cations, prior to the start of the 
study.  The written assent of mi nor patients will be obt ained per individual site guidelines.  
The ICF must be dated and signed by [CONTACT_233557]’s

If the ICF is amended during the study, the investigator must follow all applicable regulatory 
requirements pertaining to all ne w patients and repeat the consen t process with the amended ICF 
for any ongoing patients. 
9.3 Assignment of Patient Identification Number 
Study NS-065/NCNP-01-211 participation begins once written informed consent/assent is 
obtained from the patient or the parent/legal guardian for a patient (if the patient is a minor) 
before any study-specific pr ocedures are performed.  
Following the signing of the written ICF/Assent  Form, patients will be assigned a unique, 
site-specific, 6-digit patient identification number in sequentia l order of scre ening into the 
study.  The patient identification nu mber will be assigned by [CONTACT_233559]-identified genetic test report to the central  genetic counselor to confirm that the patient 
meets the genetic diagnostic eligibility criteria .  If the de-identified genetic test report is 
submitted to the central genetic counselor prior to  signing of the ICF (only if acceptable per local 
IRB/IEC), then the report will have personal health informati on removed prior to sending for 
review.  
All data will be identified using the unique pa tient identification number.   The assigned patient 
identification number will be re tained through enrollment and throughout participation in the 
study.  Patient identification numbe rs assigned to patients who fail  screening may not be used 
again.   
Each investigator will keep a Pati ent Identification log relating th e names of the patients to their 
patient identification numbers to permit efficient ve rification of patient files, when required.   
9.3.1 Screen Failures 
Patients who fail to meet inclus ion criteria are considered to be screen failures and are not 
required to return for additional visits (although a patient can be seen by [CONTACT_233560]).  Patie nts who have failed screening ma y be retested up to 2 times [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

repeat all Screening procedures.  This full resc reening may be performed  up to 2 times, after 
which the patient is no longer eligible for the study. 
If rescreening is more than 90 da ys since a current ICF/Assent Fo rm has been signed and/or the 
consent form has been modified fr om their original consent, patie nts should be reconsented prior 
to rescreening procedures. 
9.4 Genetic Confirmation of Diagnosis 
As part of the Screening assess ments, the central gene tic counselor will revi ew the de-identified 
genetic report to confirm the pa tient’s DMD diagnosis and presence of a mutation that  is eligible 
for skippi[INVESTIGATOR_180114] 53.  The date  of diagnosis, method of diagnosis, and diagnosis results will 
be documented in source documents a nd captured in the relevant eCRF.   
A DMD genetic test at Screeni ng will be conducted in order to obtain uniform DMD mutation 
information for the exact intronic boundaries and will be analyzed by a central laboratory. 
9.5 Demographics 
The following information will be collected and documented in source documents and captured 
in the relevant eCRF: date of birth (if allowed by [CONTACT_24550]), race, ethnicity, and hand 
dominance.  If local regulations do not allow collec tion of full date of birth, then year of birth 
should be collected.  
9.[ADDRESS_281890] events will be documented in source

9.7 Prior and Concomitant Treatment 
The investigator or designee will review prior and concomitant treatment as indicated in the 
Schedules of Study Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).  See Section 8  for additional details. 
9.8 Weight and Height 
Ulna length will be measured in all patients at the visits specified in the Schedules of Study 
Assessme nts (Table 1  and Table 2 ).  If the patient is able to sta nd, standing height will also be 
collected with the patient barefoot  (without shoes).  The patient’s le gs should be kept as close as [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

will be collected with the patient barefoot (wit hout shoes) and wearing light-weight clothes.  
These measurements are routinely performed during standard clinical exa minations of patients 
with DMD.  Weight in kilogr ams and height in centimeter s will be documented in source 
documents and captured in the relevant eCRF.   
9.9 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be performed at the visits sp ecified in the Schedules of Study Assessments 
(Table 1  and Table 2 ).   
Vital signs can be measured in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], semi -recumbent, or sitting position.  A consistent 
position should be maintained for each individual patient.  When ever vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, 
and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the a ssessments should occur in the 
following order: 12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood draws, with vital si gns obtained without 
repositioning.  If the patient changes position during or after the ECG assessment, then a 
5-minute rest would need to occur in the new pos ition prior to measuring v ital signs.  Otherwise, 
vital signs can be measured i mmediately after the ECG is completed, and blood draws can occur 
immediately after vital signs.  At time points af ter infusion when vital signs are measured but 
ECGs are not performed, patients should maintain the position in which they were infused.  At 
all other times when vital signs are measured but ECGs are not performed, vital signs will be 
measured after a 5-minute rest.   
For each visit that includes IP administration, vita l signs will be performed at predose, as well as 
1 hour (up to 20 minutes following comple tion of the infusion) and 2 hours ( 20 minutes) after 
initiation of infusion.  If a clinic ally significant (CS) change fro m predose is observed at 2 hours 
after initiation of infusion, the paramete r will be measured again at 6 hours ( 20 minutes) after 
initiation of infusion.   
Vital signs will be measured prior to any blood collection scheduled at the same time point and 
will include the following: 
 Systolic blood pressure 
 Diastolic blood pressure 
 Heart rate  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Vital signs will be documented in source documents and captured in the relevant eCRF.  Any CS 
changes noted by [CONTACT_118017]. 
For each patient who is eligible and has elected to receive home infusions, the investigator and 
home infusion nurse will discuss vital sign guide lines for home infusion for each patient.  The 
investigator will take into consideration the range of clinically safe vital signs that have been 
observed for the patient during pa st study site infusions.  The hom e infusion nurse will consult 
with the investigator for any confirmed vital signs outside of these guidelin es (low or high).  See 
Section 9.1.1  for additional detail s on home infusion. 
9.10 Physical and Neurological Examination 
The physical and neurological exam inations will be performed at the visits specified in the 
Schedules of Study Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ) to assess any changes in physical 
presentation and symptoms. 
Physical and neurological examinations w ill include an assessment of the following: 
 General appearance 
 Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat 
 Skin 
 Lymph nodes 
 Heart, including rhythm, heart sounds, and presence of cardiac abnormalities 
 Lungs 
 Abdomen 
 Extremities/joints

distal) that in DMD are progressively involved with a proximal  to distal gradient.  The PUL 2.0 
includes 22 items with an entry item to define the starting func tional level.  The 22 items are 
subdivided into the high level shoulder dimens ion (6 items), middle level elbow dimension 
(9 items), and distal wrist and hand dimension (7 items).   For weaker patients, a low score on the 
entry item (0-2) means high level items do not need to be performed.  Scoring options vary 
across the scale between 0-[ADDRESS_281900] and hand dime nsion.  A total score can be 
achieved by [CONTACT_233563] 3 level scores  (for maximum total score of 42).

If a patient returns to the clinic for a visit outsid e of the protocol evalua tion time points, the visit 
and any assessments and/or tests performed will be recorded in the source documents and the 
eCRF as an Unscheduled Visit.   
10.3.4  Early Termination or Wit hdrawal from the Study 
A patient (or the legal guardian acting on behalf of the patient) is  free to withdraw consent and 
discontinue participation in the study at a ny time, without prejudice to further treatment, 
according to standard clinical practice.  Study pa rticipation may be discontinued at any time at 
the discretion of the investigat or or sponsor.  The following ma y be justifiable reasons for 
removing a patient:  
 Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102]/legal guardian 
 Failure to comply with the protocol 
 Lost-to-follow-up 
 Illness, condition, or procedural  complication (including AEs) af fecting the patient’s ability 
to participate or requir ing prohibited medication 
 In the investigator’s judgment, it is deemed in the best interest of the patient to discontinue 
his/her participation in the study 
 The investigator, sponsor, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and/or regulatory 
authority terminates the study 
 Any other reason 
A Patient Completion/Discontinuation eCRF, desc ribing the reason for discontinuation, must be 
completed for any discontinued or withdrawn patien t regardless of reason.  If a pa tient withdraws 
from the study or if the study is prematurely terminated, the inves tigator or designee will contact 
[CONTACT_12718]’s legal guardian within 30  days after withdrawal  or termination to 
assess any AEs.  The investigator will be asked to follow all SAEs until the event returns to 
baseline or until the investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary. 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study may not re-enter.  
The following assessments should be performed  at the time of early termination: 
 Medical history (any updat es will be recorded)  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

10.3.5  Procedures for Early Termination 
If a patient withdraws or is removed from th e study for any reason, all early termination 
procedures should be completed per the Schedules of Study Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2 ).  
Reason for withdrawal, date of th e discontinuation, and date of th e last dose of IP should be 
recorded in source documents and in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  IP assigned to the 
withdrawn patient may not be as signed to another patient. 
The medical monitor and study chair should be co nsulted prior to the withdrawal of the study 
patient, except in the case of a medical emergenc y.  Written notice (regardless of cause) is to be 
provided to the medical monitor within [ADDRESS_281908] a DSMB meeting and cons ult with the sponsor.  If the study chair, medical monitor, 
DSMB, and sponsor agree that sa fety concerns warrant termina tion of the study, the sponsor will 
terminate the study.  A written statement fully do cumenting the reasons fo r such a termination 
will be provided to investigators, IRBs/IECs,  and regulatory authorities, if required.

by [CONTACT_233567]. 
AEs may include, but are not limited to: 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (includi ng an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal pr oduct, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product 
 Any new disease or exacerba tion of an existing disease 
 Any deterioration in non-protoc ol-required measurements of  laboratory value or other 
clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation 
from IP 
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities  already existing prio r to the use of the 
product are not considered AEs after treatment, unless they re occur after the patient has 
recovered from the preexisting c ondition or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], they represent a 
CS exacerbation in intensity or frequency.  If CS  worsening from baseline is noted, the changes 
will be documented in the AE source document and the eCRF.   
TEAEs are defined as any AE or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of the IP and 
through 30 days after completi on of study participation. 
A suspected adverse reaction is  any noxious and unintended re sponse for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New 
Drug safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is ev idence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE.  A susp ected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than adverse r eaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
An AE and/or a suspected adverse reaction is consid ered “unexpected” if it is  not listed in the IB 
or is not listed at the specificit y or severity that has been previ ously observed.  As viltolarsen is 
approved in the US, the US package insert will be referenced for the purposes of expedited [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

11.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An AE is serious when the patient outcome is: 
Death
Life-threatening (see below for expanded definition)
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged)
Disability or permanent damage (s ee below for expanded definition)
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed
above
Life-threatening experience: Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the site investigator, 
at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occu rred, i.e., does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death. 
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233516] (e.g., life- threatening; required 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically important 
event). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233517] e will not be considered an SAE.  However, 
unexpected complications and/or  prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233518].  Admission to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233519] (e.g., no place to stay, live too far away to come for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will not be consid ered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Disability or permanent damage: Any AE that results in a substa ntial disruption of a patient’s 
ability to conduct nor mal life functions, i.e., the AE resulted in a sign ificant, persistent or 
permanent change, impairment, damage, or disrup tion in the patient's bod y function/structure, 
physical activities, and/ or quality of life. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

life-threatening, or require hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_17288], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize th e patient and may requir e medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above. 
11.3 Severity 
It is the investigator’s res ponsibility to assess the intens ity (severity) of an AE.   
The severity of the AE will be characterized and recorded as “mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threatening, or death” according to the following definitions: The CTCAE version 4.03 
guidelines for severity assessments will be used  to grade AEs for this study (available at 
evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ).  The CTCA E version 4.03 listed guidelines for 
severity assessment are:  
 Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clin ical or diagnostic observations only or 
intervention not indicated 
 Moderate: Minimal, local, or non invasive intervention indicate d or limited age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
 Severe: Severe or medically  significant but not immedi ately life-threatening; or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; or disabling; or limiting self-care 
ADL  
 Life-threatening: Life-threat ening consequences or urge nt intervention indicated 
 Death: Death related to AE 
Note: A severe AE need not be seriou s, and an SAE need not be severe. 
11.4 Relationship 
It is the investigator’s responsib ility to assess the re lationship between the IP and the AE.  The 
degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IP  may be described usi ng the following scale: 
 Not Related 
o Not Related:  No temporal association and othe r etiologies are likely the cause.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
NS-065/NCNP-01 NS Pharma, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: NS-065/NCNP-01-211 v2.0 21Mar2022 
   
 
NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 86 of 117 o Unlikely:  Event or laboratory test abnormalit y, with a time to drug that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossibl e).  Diseases or other drugs provide 
plausible explanations. 
 Related 
o Possible: Temporal association, but other etiologies are like ly the cause.  However, 
involvement of the IP cannot be excluded. 
o Probable:  Temporal association, other etiologi es are possible but unlikely.  The 
event may respond if the IP is discontinued. 
o Definite:  Established temporal asso ciation with administration of the IP with no other 
more probable cause.  The event should reso lve when the IP is discontinued and recur 
on re-challenge. 
11.[ADDRESS_281910] based on the route of administration 
and toxicology profil e for viltolarsen: 
 Access device complication (for patient s with indwelling access devices) 
 Urinary protein excretion 300 mg/day based on a 24- hour urine collection 
 Serum cystatin C 1.5 × baseline, or serum creatinine 2 × baseline and 0.3 mg/dL, 
confirmed with a repeat test with in 1 week of the original results  (i.e., meets the cystatin C or 
creatinine criteria for referral to a nephrologist described in Section 11.12.1 ) 
 Any confirmed instances of hematuria or othe r potentially CS abnorma lities on urinalysis  
11.6 Disease-Related Signs and Symptoms 
Reporting of disease-related or DMD-related signs and symptoms as AEs is based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  However, pr ogression of symptoms and signs associated with 
DMD that is inconsistent with the usual course of  the disease should be reported as an AE in the 
eCRF and source documentation.

will be recorded: 
 Description of the event (e.g., headache) 
 Date of onset 
 Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing) 
 Action taken as a result of the event 
 Seriousness of the event 
 Severity of the event 
 Outcome of the event 
 Investigator’s assessment of relationship to IP 
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause  should be reported as a single 
AE (e.g., fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest X-ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”). 
The investigator will carefully evaluate the co mments of the patient and the response to 
treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AE to IP administration should be determin ed by [CONTACT_233568]. 
CS changes from time of ICF will be documente d as AEs on the AE eCRF.  CS changes are 
physical findings that have medi cal relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care.

For all AEs that require the patient to be discontinued fro m the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s). 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessmen t in the study are followed up by 
[CONTACT_233569], but without further recording in 
the eCRF.  The CRO retains the right to request  additional information for any patient with 
ongoing AEs at the end of the st udy, if judged necessary.  
11.11  Pregnancy Reporting 
The NS Pharma, Inc.-designated CRO should be notif ied in the event that a female partner of a 
patient becomes pregnant at any time after the pa tient’s first dose of IP.  Any such pregnancy 
occurring on-study or within [ADDRESS_281916] be done whether or not an  AE has occurred and within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The in formation submitted should also include the 
anticipated date of birth or pregnancy termination.  
Written consent is required prior to collecting and reporting any informa tion on a female partner 
of a patient.  
If possible, the investigator should follow the pregnant female partne r of the patient until 
completion of the pregnancy and not ify the medical monitor of the outcome within 5 days or as [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 90 of 117 specified below.  The investigator will provide this information as a follow-up to the initial 
Pregnancy Notification Form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classificati on as an SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital a nomaly [including in an aborted 
fetus]), the investigator should follow the procedures  for reporting SAEs (see Section 11.7.3 ).  
11.12  General Monitoring and Management of Ab normal Clinical Laboratory Findings 
It is the investigator’s responsib ility to review the re sults of all laboratory tests as they become 
available and to sign and date the results indicati ng review.  For each laboratory test outside of 
the laboratory normal range, the investigator must  ascertain if this represents a CS change from 
baseline for the individual pati ent.  The investigator may repe at a laboratory test or request 
additional tests to verify results of the original laboratory test. 
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and CS change from baseline for the 
patient, the investigator should dete rmine if it qualifies as an AE, and if so, an appropriate eCRF 
will be completed.  All CS laboratory abnormaliti es occurring during the study and that were not 
present at baseline should be followed and eval uated with additional tests if necessary, until 
diagnosis of the underlyi ng cause, or resolution.  
11.12.[ADDRESS_281917] morning void urine dipstick protein 2+, UPCR 0.5 mg/mg, or 
UPCR 2 × baseline, a first morning void urine dipstic k protein will be repeated within [ADDRESS_281918] , a 24-hour urine sample will be 
collected within 1 week of the results to asse ss protein and creatinine.   If proteinuria on a 
24-hour urine sample is 300 mg/day, the patient will be referred to a nephrologist. 
In addition, any instances of hematuria or othe r potentially CS abnormalities on urinalysis will 
be confirmed at the following week ’s visit, or sooner at discreti on of the investigator.  Confirmed 
CS treatment-emergent a bnormalities will be recorded as AE s and discussed with the medical 
monitor.  Abnormalities will be mo nitored and evaluated with additi onal tests or consultations, if 
necessary, until the underlying cause is determined, or the event is brought to an acceptable 
resolution.  Additional c linical and laboratory information ma y be collected and documented in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

NS Pharma, Inc. – CONFIDENTIAL   Page 91 of 117 order to better characterize abnormalities and id entify etiology and appr opriate management.  
Potential need for interruption or discontinuation of IP should be discussed with the medical 
monitor and sponsor. 
If serum cystatin C 1.5 × baseline, or if serum creatinine 2 × baseline and 0.3 mg/dL, the test 
will be repeated within [ADDRESS_281919]. 
11.13  Monitoring and Management of  Abnormal Electrocardiograms 
If a CS ECG abnormality occurs th at was not present at baseline (S creening) and the investigator 
determines that the abnormality is related to IP, the abnormality will be discussed with the 
medical monitor.  The ECG abnormality will be m onitored and evaluated w ith additional tests (if 
necessary) until the underlying cause  is determined or the event is brought to an acceptable 
resolution.  Additional c linical and laboratory information will be collected and carefully 
documented in order to better char acterize the ECG abnormality and rule out alternative causes.  
ECG findings determined to be a CS change from baseline should be reported as an AE 
regardless of causality. 
Unscheduled ECG assessments will be complete d at the discretion of the investigator.  
11.14  Intravenous Access Considerations 
IP dosing will be administered through IV infusi on.  Peripheral venous access (IV catheter that 
empties into a peripheral  vein in the arms, hands, legs, or feet) is the preferred route of IP 
administration for this study.   
A CVA (IV catheter that empties into a large centr al vein) will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for patients who have di fficulty with peripheral venous  access.  A TICVAD port is the 
preferred option of CVA, if necessary, for this study.  The sponsor will decide whether or not to 
approve this option after discussions with the investigator and medical monitor have ensured 
mutual agreement that CVA will still maintain a positive benefit/risk ratio for the patient in this 
study.  Before final decision, NS Pharma, Inc. w ill obtain documentation from the investigator 
that the consulting surgeon who will place the port holds hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180120] a board

12.1 General Considerations 
The statistical analyses described in this sec tion will be performed as further outlined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock.  The SAP will 
supersede the protocol if there are any differences  between the 2 documents in the plans for data 
analysis and the differences will be noted in th e SAP.  The SAP will be included as an appendix 
in the Clinical Study Report fo r this protocol.  The data will be hosted and processed by

12.6 Efficacy Assessments 
12.6.1  Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective is to co mpare the efficacy of viltolarsen administered IV at weekly 
doses of 80 mg/kg over a 48-week Treatment Period versus natural history controls in ambulant 
and non-ambulant boys 8 years of age with DMD for the following endpoints: absolute and 
percent predicted PEF, FVC, and FEV1, Brooke and Vignos functional scales, and the NSAA.  
The PUL and hand-held dynamometry will be described and the cha nge over time estimated for 
the viltolarsen-treated group only. 
In addition to the comparison methods desc ribed below, all outcomes for both the 
viltolarsen-treated and historical control groups will be summarized and tabulated at each time 
point assessed.  Time points in the historical control will match those of the vilt olarsen-treated 
group within pre-defined tolerances .  Outcomes at baseline will be  compared between viltolarsen 
and control groups using met hods appropriate for the di stribution of each outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_233520] d PEF rate over the length of the study will be 
compared between patients receiving viltolarsen  and the historical control group using mixed

Validity will be explored through correlation of al l clinical strength and fu nction tests and patient 
reported outcomes with raw data obtained from the AGT9x during clinical testing.  Information 
such as steps, speed, body position/location (usi ng vector magnitude per minute data) will be 
derived from the raw data; relationships with clin ical tests will result from data conversions, 
descriptive analysis, and correlati ons with the raw data.  Additiona lly, raw data will be analyzed 
throughout the study to explore ch anges in activity a nd sleep-wake patterns.  Throughout the full 
study, 2-week bouts of continuous data will be analyzed through R*Studio (version 3.5.1, 
Vienna, Austria) and the nparACT package (ver sion 0.8) to determine sleep-wake rhythms.  
Sleep-wake rhythms are measured as  intradaily variability (quantif ies the frequency and extent of 
transitions between periods of rest and activity  on an hourly basis) and relative amplitude 
(derived from the normalized difference between the most active 10-hour  period and least active 
5-hour period in an average 24-hour pattern).  Raw data will also be analyzed with ActiLife 
software to identify and score sl eep periods defined as nightly per cent sleep efficiency (total time 
in bed/total time asleep), average number of  nightly awakenings (mean number of nightly 
awakenings longer than 3-minute durations), and average duration of nightly awakenings (mean 
duration of nightly awakenings th at are longer than 3 minutes).  Effect sizes to determine the

 2 SYNOPSIS 
Study Title Postpartum depression after Cesarean delivery:  
Ketamine as a preventative intervention.  
A feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-study (PoCKet Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]).  
Primary Objective To assess the feasibility of the study by [CONTACT_9851]:  
a) the incidence of [COMPANY_003] in our cohort; 
b) the acceptability to eligible patients; 
c) the ability of the investigative team to collect the data an d; 
d) the tolerability of the interventions.  
Hypothesis We hypothesize that ketamine reduces the incidence of postpartum depression ([COMPANY_003]) when administered at 
cesarean delivery and that the subcutaneous route is well 
tolerated and has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile.  
Study Period Planned enrolment duration: 52 weeks 
Planned study duration: 58 weeks  
Number of Participants 60 patients  (20 in each of the subcutaneous [SC], intravenous [IVI] and 
control [P] 
groups ) 
Study Intervention Patients in each group will receive both subcutaneous (s/c) 
and intravenous (i.v.) administration of their corresponding 
injectate shortly after delivery of their baby. The injectate w ill 
consist of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride (N/S) or 50 mg/ml 
ketamine (Ket) depending on their group allocation. The s/c injectate will be administered undiluted whereas the i.v. 
in
jectate will be diluted to make up a 40 ml infusion.

 5 1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
1.1 Postpartum depression ([COMPANY_003])  
 
[COMPANY_003] is one of the most common perinatal medical complications a nd can have a detrimental 
effect on both mother and baby. Suicide exceeds hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders as 
a cause of maternal mortality1 and maternal psychopathology interferes with the parent-
infant relationship2. It has been estimated to have a period prevalence of 19.2% in  the first [ADDRESS_1138787] 
additional risk factors (Table 1) for [COMPANY_003] in the postpartum per iod. 
 
 Depression during pregnancy  Breastfeeding problems 
 Preterm birth/infant admission to 
neonatal intensive care (NICU)  Traumatic birth experience 
 H i s t o r y of depression 
 Anxiety during pregnancy 
Table 1:  Risk factors for [COMPANY_003] 
 
1.2 Ketamine’s anti-depressant effect 
 
Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, is a non-competitive anta gonist at the N-methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor that is commonly used as an anest hetic or sedative agent 
and has proven analgesic effect after a variety of surgeries in cluding CD6, where it has also 
been shown to reduce shivering7. It has been demonstrated to have a rapid anti-depressant 
effect in treatment-resistant depression8 outside of pregnancy. The most commonly 
employed intravenous (IV) dose for this purpose is 0.5 mg/kg over [ADDRESS_1138788] explored longer term infusions such as those used to treat chronic 
pain9. A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_821557] a 96-hour ( ~0.5mg/kg/hr) infusion10 
compared with a single 40-minute (0.5 mg/kg) infusion suggested  a trend toward greater 
efficacy in the prolonged infusion but confirmation of a statis tically significant result is 
awaited.  
1.[ADDRESS_1138789] been  2 studies to date
11,12, 
one which failed to demonstrate any benefit from a bolus dose of 0.25 mg/kg and one which 
documented a large reduction (1 and 22% in the treatment and control, respectively) in the 
(6 week) period prevalence of postpartum depression after a 4 m g/kg dose of ketamine over 
50 hours (~0.08 mg/kg/hr).  
The prolonged IV infusion, in the Jianxin (2015)
12 study, was achieved by [CONTACT_821561] a sufentanil patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) pump with a background infusion. This PCA pump is a standard part of their post-cesarean analgesic regimen. In our 
institution, it is standard practice to discontinue IV infusion s and to remove IV cannulae as 
early as it is safe to do so. This practice is essential to the  attempts to enhance 
postoperative recovery and aid mother’s bonding with their babi es and facilitate their early-
Version 01/24/2020 
 6 life care. This reflects patients’ expectations and preferences  and is in line with other 
maternity units across North America and Europe.  
 The natural course of [COMPANY_003] varies and, although it may resolve s pontaneously within weeks, 
approximately 20% of women with P PD still have depression at 12  months and beyond. As 
many as 13% will still have depressive symptoms at 2 years and 40% will have a relapse
13. 
Considering the maternal suffering, disruption to the family, p otential impairment of the 
social, emotional, and cognitive development of the child14, and the rare cases of infanticide 
and suicide caused by [CONTACT_3642], the impact on families and society a s a whole is difficult to 
overemphasize. An intervention that promises such a large reduc tion in this devastating 
disease warrants extensive research. In an attempt to achieve t he benefit demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_821562]. whilst employing methods more acceptable to our patients we have designed a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_821558] c ollect preliminary tolerability and 
efficacy data on ketamine administered by [CONTACT_821563]: 40-minute IV infusion (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) injection.

3.1.1 Term pregnancy 
3.1.2 Age 18-45 years of age 
3.1.3 Scheduled cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia 
3.2 Exclusion criteria: 
3.2.1 ASA classification IV or V 
3.2.2 History of psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
3.2.3 History of allergy to ketamine 
3.2.4 Inability to communicate in English or any other barrier to pro viding 
informed consent 
3.3 Inclusion of women and minorities: 
3.3.1 Eligible pregnant women of all ethnicities and cultures presenting to the 
Barnes Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419412] & Delivery floor will be invited t o participate 
in this research 
 
4 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
 
4.1 Confirmation of patient eligibility 
4.1.1 We will screen all patients scheduled for cesarean delivery and confirm 
their eligibility by [CONTACT_821564]: i) age; ii) gestational a ge; iii) medical 
history and; iv) allergy history. 
4.2 Assignment of unique participant number 
4.2.1 Each patient will be identified with a unique participant numbe r (UPN) for 
this study. All data will be recorded with this identification number on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). 
4.3 Randomization 
4.3.1 Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: SC, IVI or 
Control. The randomization will be performed in 1:1:1 ratio in blocks of 6, 
with no stratifications.  
 
5 STUDY DESIGN 
 
5.1 This will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The primary 
outcomes are related to the ability of the study procedures to gather data on the 
interventions’ efficacy in preventing postpartum depression. Su ccessful attainment of 
the following feasibility milestones (FM) is necessary to justi fy proceeding with a 
pragmatic clinical trial:  
5.1.1 FM1: Establish that the incidence of [COMPANY_003] in our cohort is >10% 
5.1.2 FM2: Achieve the recruitment of >50% of approached patients to 
demonstrate feasibility for an RCT 
5.1.3 FM3: Ensure that the design of assessments and data collection make it 
possible to achieve a complete dataset in >90% of participants 
Version 01/24/2020 
 8 5.1.4 FM4:  Ascertain that none of chosen routes of administration of keta mine 
is intolerable to patients, as defined as the incidence of one or more 
severe side effects experienced by >10% of participants in that  study arm.

Table 2: Intervention groups. *the i.v. injectate will be diluted up to a [ADDRESS_1138791] baseline data (Table 3) recorded on the relevant case report 
form on the day of delivery. This data will include demographic s to assess the performance 
of randomization procedures as we ll as characteristics that hav e been demonstrated to 
confer an increased risk of [COMPANY_003]. The patient will be prepared f or cesarean as per  
institutional protocols.

 Once an adequate sensory block is achieved, surgery will commen ce. Upon delivery of the 
baby, 0.01 ml/kg of the “subcutaneous injectate” will be injected subcutaneously and the 
“intravenous injectate”  will be made up to a 40ml infusion (Table 4) and commenced at 60 
ml/hr. Both injectates will be administered/initiated approximately [ADDRESS_1138792] patient 
care. The intravenous study infusion will be prepared by a memb er of the investigative team, 
who will not be involved in data collection. 
 
Add 0.01 ml/kg of the “IVI study solution” to a 60ml syringe and use 0.9% sodium chloride 
to dilute the solution to 40ml.

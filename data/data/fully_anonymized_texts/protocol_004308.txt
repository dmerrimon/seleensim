Population:  Pediatric patients requiring a primary cleft lip repair younger than 6 months of  age.  
Goal of 40 patients total enrolled.  
Number  of Sites:  UT Health – Memorial Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – [LOCATION_007] Medical  Center  
 
Study  Duration:  7/1/20 14 – 6/30/[ADDRESS_586530]  Duration:  From pre -operative assessment to minimum 1 year follow  up 
 
 
 
General Information  
 Primary  cleft  lip repairs  are most  frequently  done  at 3 months  of age. There  are many  factors  that influence 
the final cosmetic appearance of the repair including wound tension. Unacceptable amounts of tension can 
lead to poor cosmetic appearance, wound dehiscence or fistula formation. Use of Botulinum toxin 
intraoperatively can reduce wound tension and  therefore improve outcomes of cleft lip  repairs.
 
Background Information  
 Hypothesis: Utilizing Botulinum toxin intraoperatively during primary cleft lip repair will improve the cosmetic 
appearance of cleft lip scars. Patients with unilateral c left lips with or without cleft palates will be  considered. 
 Few studies have been done utilizing botulinum toxin to improve outcomes of cleft lip repairs. Cleft lip repair 
outcomes are influenced by a number of factors including wound tension. Wound tensio n is often 
unavoidable in these patients due to continuous muscle contraction from crying or feeding. Therefore, 
limiting muscle contraction could potentially improve outcomes of these repairs. Tollefson et al. in [ADDRESS_586531] -operative  aesthetic  outcomes 
at early follow up without any  complications. 
 The need to chemoimmobilze musculature associated with cleft lip repair is of even greater importance as 
multiple studies have shown increased activity of these muscles. Carvajal et al. established that orbicularis 
oris activity was significantly greater i n cleft lip and palate patients than those children without clefts. 
Aside from the impact this can have on the growing maxilla this increased muscle activity can be 
problematic for cleft lip repair  cosmesis. 
 In 2009, Galárraga used intraoperative botulinum  toxin on 5 patients all younger than 6 months of age 
undergoing  a primary  cheiloplasty.  The study  showed  the botulinum  toxin  injections  to be safe without  any 
complications observed. An EMG proven decrease in muscle activity around the repair site was als o seen 
as predicted. 
 Studies  in adult  patients  have  shown  improved  cosmetic  outcomes  for facial  wounds  when  utilizing  botulinum 
toxin. They have also established use of the toxin as safe in the face. Ziade et al. in 2013 showed injections of 
botulinum tox in type A within 72 hours postoperatively around facial wound repairs had better scar results at 
1 year follow up as analyzed by 6 expert specialists. Wilson in 2006, showed utilization of botulinum toxin in 
revision facial scar surgery had 90 % of patient s with a highly satisfactory  outcome. 

Objectives  
Improve cheiloplasty outcomes with the use of intraoperative injection of botulinum toxin to clefted lip.  
 
Study Design  
 Randomized double blinded controlled trial of pediatric patients who require a primary unilateral cleft lip 
repair  younger  than  6 months  of age.  Utilization  of botulinum  toxin  intraoperatively  at targeted  locations  of 
the cleft lip. Surgeon, parents and expert panel of surgeons used at the completion study will all be blinded 
to which patients received the experimental  injection. 
 Control  subjects will  receive  injections  of normal saline  at identical  sites  of the cleft  lip as experimental 
subjects.
 20 patients in each group will be  enrolled.
 Patients will be evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 
12 months of follow  up.
 Inclusion criteria : Unilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate, less than 6 months of  age
 Exclusion criteria : Bilateral cle ft lip, older than 6 months of  age
 Primary endpoint: Blinded assessment of wound cosmesis by [CONTACT_459228].  At completion  of follow  up use of aesthetic  grading  criteria  of videography  images  as described  by [CONTACT_459229]. in 2008. These criteria include: Matching accuracy of white roll and vermilion border, scar appearance, Cupid’s 
bow form, length of lip, nostril symmetry, alar dome form, and alar base  position
 
Study Population  
 Pediatric patients with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate less than 6 months of age undergoing cleft  lip 
repair.
 All patients who will be planned for a primary cleft lip repair will be offered to be enrolled in the 
study. Parents may choose to decli ne and undergo repair without enrollment in the  study.
 Patients will be recruited as they would present otherwise to the University of [LOCATION_007] Pediatric Plastic 
Surgery Clinic to be evaluated for repair of cleft  lip.
 
Study Procedures  
 Patient will receive in traoperative botulinum toxin injections in the upper labial musculature prior to  
the operative repair being  started.
 4 injection sites will be used two superior and inferiorly in the cleft lip, 1 unit of botulinum toxin per 
injection site to be used. This  is considered low dose in the pediatric population. Depending on the patient’s 
weight it will be approximately 1  unit/kg.
 This dosing was chosen as it has been proven safe without any complications in prior pediatric botulinum 
toxin  studies.
 This dosage h as also been shown to adequately elicit muscle paresis in the head and  neck.
 Patients will have videography performed preoperatively as well at scheduled post -operative  visits.
 Parents will complete a Modified Vancouver Scar Scale at selective post -operative  visits
 The Vancouver scar scale is a widely used validated scar scale for adults, however given our study it was 
modified appropriately for pediatric populations. There is no  validated scar scale for pediatric  patients.
 At the completion of the [ADDRESS_586532] plastic 
surgeons that will also use the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale to assess scar outcomes in both the control and 
experimental groups. This panel will be blinded to which patients received botulinum toxin and which 
received the control  injection. 
 Videography  at the completion  of the study  will also be assessed  for the following measures: Matching 
accuracy of white roll and vermilion border, scar appearance, Cupid’s bow form, length of lip, nostril 
symmetry, alar dome form, and alar base position. Study personnel will be blinded to which patients 
received the experimenta l injection. 
 No invasive procedures or postoperative monitoring will be employed unless deemed medically  necessary. 

noted transient fatigue in less than 5% of  patients.  
- Given that botulinum toxin takes [ADDRESS_586534]  studies  already  completed, 
therefore the risk should be less as the risk of botulinum toxin is dose  dependent.  
- Two prior cleft lip studies utilizing botulinum toxin reported good outcomes with no complications 
or feeding  difficulties.  
 
Rare reporte d adult adverse side effects of botulinum toxin include: Difficulty swallowing, breathing, speaking, 
feeding, diffuse muscle weakness, double vision, voice changes, allergic reaction and bladder dysfunction. However, 
no documented adverse effects have been  noted when used at dermatologic doses on the face.  
 
 
 
Safety  
- Two studies on cleft lip patients younger than [ADDRESS_586535] been 
completed without any complications and shown the toxin to be safe in this population.  
 
Prior cleft specific studies  
- Tollefson et al. in 2006 with 3 patients and Galarraga in 2009 with 5 patients used botulinum toxin 
injections in the cleft lip without any reported complications.

Prior pediatric botulinum toxin studies  
- Botulinum toxin injections are also used for a large variety of pediatric conditions safely  including 
ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal and  neurological.  
- Messner et al. in 2011 used 7 botulinum toxin injections in 3 patients younger than 6 months of age 
with  for cricopharyngeal  achalasia.  Injections  were  done  in the cricopharyngeus  muscle  with  successful 
treatment allowing patients to eat by [CONTACT_181632] a result. No complications were encountered with an 
average follow up of 22 months, 3.3units/kg of botulinum toxin were  used.  
- Pascual and Pascual in 2008, reviewed botulinum toxin injection safety in p atients younger than 2 years 
old. 74 patients received botulinum toxin injections with 28 younger than 1 year of age. Only 1 patient 
was noted  to develop  transient  fatigue  that lasted  less than  4 days  without  intervention. All  other  patients 
did well with no significant adverse effects. On average 6.55 units/kg for patients less than 1 year of age 
and 8.4 units/kg in patients 1 -2 years old were used. They deemed botulinum toxin injections safe at the 
appropriate  dosage.  
- Chhina et al. in 2013 showed higher dosages of botulinum toxin were safe in patients less than 2 years 
of age. Injections were done in the feet on patients with clubfeet. 239 patients and 361 feet were 
injected  with  10 units/kg.  No complications  were  noted  in any patien t and again  deemed botulinum  toxin 
injections  safe.  
- Oleszek et al. in 2005 performed botulinum toxin injections for patients aged 6 -18 months with 
congenital torticollis. 29.7 units of botulinum toxin were used on average for each patient. Only 2  patients 
had transient neck weakness with mild dysphagia that resolved without intervention. They showed that 
even at higher doses botulinum toxin was safe to use in the head and  neck.  
- Of note  our study  will only  use a low dose  of 4 units  of botulinum  toxin  total  and will approximately  be 1 
unit/kg dosing depending on the weight of our study patient. This dosage is less than most pediatric 
botulinum toxin injection studies to date and therefore should be a safe  dosage.  
- As noted  above  a large  number  of studies  have  shown  botulinum  toxin  to be safe at both low  and high 
doses at a variety of anatomic locations including the head and  neck.  
 
Safety Monitoring  
The PI, co -investigator and mentor will review any reported adverse events monthly.  
 
 Patients feeding  capabilities, respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219], neuromuscular function and overall health will be 
evaluated on each scheduled follow up  visit.
 
Statistics  
 Using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale we hypothesize the average score for controls to be [ADDRESS_586536]  an average  score  of 10 out of 11. Given  a 90%  confidence  interval  and 
standard deviation of 2.[ADDRESS_586537].
 Therefore 20 patients will be the goal group size  for each arm of the study; botulinum toxin injection 
group versus control  group.
 The study will be terminated if any subjects display significant adverse side effects that are potentially 
life threatening including feeding, cardiovascular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_2340]. 
 Study subjects to be used will be all patients who will undergo a primary cleft lip repair that agree 
to participation in the study and subsequent  randomization. 
 
Ethics  
 Prior to initiating the study University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center  at Houston Institutional Review 
Board will need to grant approval for the  study.
 Consent will be obtained in person at the time of the pre -operative visit in the University of [LOCATION_007] Pediatric 
Plastic Surgery clinic. This consent will be in addition to the  consent obtained for the surgical procedure. The 
known  risks  and adverse  effects of  botulinum  toxin  will be fully  disclosed  to parents  prior  to obtaining  consent 
for the  study.

 A computer  supplied  and maintained  by [CONTACT_459231]/images. The computer is password protected and is approved for use by [CONTACT_459232].
 Images of the patient will only include  the face to assess the outcomes of the repair. All images taken at 
planned post -operative visits will be taken with the same camera and calibration  settings.
 Data and images will be coded by a discrete number that will be used to identify an individual pa tient 
and their repair. No patient identifiers will be linked to the  videos
 
Quality control and assurance  
 Videography camera will be operated by a select number of users that have been taught the 
appropriate amount of training to operate it  appropriately. 
 Camera will be calibrated prior to each session to ensure consistent  videography. 
 A modified Vancouver Scar Scale will be given to parents at post -operative  visits.
 Botulinum toxin will be prepared in the same manner for each  patient.
 
Publication Plan  
 Plan to submit abstract and manuscript to reputable conferences and otolaryngology journals at the 
completion of the  study.

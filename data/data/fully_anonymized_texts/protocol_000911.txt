Study Design  
This is a prospective randomized controlled single site trial.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
Colonoscopy is a common procedure performed in the U.S. Most patients undergoing endoscopy require 
sedation to have an acceptable experience.1-2 It is a necessity because the abilit y to interpret images and 
perform therapeutic or diagnostic procedures are dependent on the subjects cooperation. Reliable imaging 
cannot be obtained if the patient is not cooperative. Propofol is a commonly used sedative that has been 
used in several stud ies for endoscopic procedures and is associated with low complication rates in healthy 
patients (ie: ASA I and III).3-[ADDRESS_302501] shown that hypoxemia frequently 
occurs during endoscopic procedures in patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 or have a history of OSA 6-9 and the 
mortality rate for sedation in the endoscopy suite is significantly higher than that of the comparable cases 
performed in operating room.10 Although the cause of the high mortality in GI suite has yet to be 
determ ined, it seems to be related to hypoxia and/or hypercarbia due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_248777].[ADDRESS_302502] pressure (CPAP), applied nasally or via facemask, has been shown to be more 
effective at mini mizing hypoxia than other devices under sedation or general anesthesia.11-[ADDRESS_302503]. Recently, a simple, novel CPAP device was developed, which

 includes a sealed nasal mask and disposable, flow -inflating hyperinflation bag (SuperNO 2VA Et™ Satellite Set, 
Revolutionary Medical Devices, [LOCATION_003]).14 A small pi[INVESTIGATOR_248778], et al. demonstrated safety and 
efficacy with the use of the SuperNO 2VA Et™ device for nasal mask ventilation (NMV) in anesthetized and 
paralyzed patients.14 It is also demonstrated that this device reduces the incidence and severity of hypoxia 
under sedation during colonocscopy.15 The objectives of our study are 1) to compare oxygenation and 
ventilation spontaneously ventilating obese patients or those with di agnosed or undiagnosed OSA 
undergoing day colonoscopy under propofol based sedation in between the SuperNO 2VA Et™ nasal positive 
airway pressure (PAP) device and routine care with face mask for O2 supply and 2) to determine its capacity 
to monitor expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559]2.

Patients with either a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and/or a documented Obstructive Sleep Apnea scheduled for 
colonoscop y with  Propofol  sedation  at are increased  risk for severe  hypoxemia  intra -operatively  and post - 
operatively.  In addition  patients  with  OSA  usually  fall into three  scenarios.  Those  that are diagnosed  with 
OSA and are using their CPAP, those that are diagnosed with OSA but do not use CPAP, and the 
undiagnosed OSA patient. Therefore, this patient population is at higher risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_248779].

4. METHODS AND STUDY  PROCEDURES  
5.1 Instruments  
The SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2 (Nasal Oxygenating Ventilating Apparatus) mask is indicated to deliver gas, 
create  a seal,  and provide  positive  pressure  while  placed  over  a patient’s  nose  and connected  to either  an 
anesthesia circuit or hyperinflation bag during respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], ane sthesia, and resuscitation procedures. The 
SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2 mask is also intended to facilitate simultaneous oxygenation and ventilation during 
intubation, as the mask covers only the patient’s nose, leaving the clinician with an unobstructed view of 
the a irway.  
 
5.2 Methods:  
This study involves the oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure, and ventilation of a subject via 
nasal  mask  and oxygenation  via a closed  facemask.  The interventions  directly  related  to this study  are that 
of supplement oxygen, and continuous nasal CPAP  intra -operatively  
Patients will be randomized in groups of ten to one of two groups using a random number table. Group 
A: Standard care with a facemask. Group B: SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2.  
 
For each anesthetic ca se, a preoperative history and physical and intraoperative record will be 
documented (table 1).

Once in the endoscopy suite, the patients  will have continuous monitoring of heart rate, end tidal CO2 
(EtC02), O2 saturation, and non -invasive blood pressure monitoring with an interval no longer than 5 
minutes. Patients randomized to group A, the anesthesia provider will supply oxygen via facem ask at 
10LPM. Patients randomized to group B, the anesthesia provider will attach the SuperNO 2VA™ EtCO2 
circuit port to the hyperinflation bag with the oxygen flow rate to 10 L/min. Initial dosing bolus 0.5 -1.0 
mg/kg actual body weight of Propofol will be administered for sedation and MOAA/S scores will be 
assessed. Nursing or the research assistant will then record the patient’s MOAA/S score. If the patient’s 
MOAA/S score is ≥ 4, additional 10 -20mg boluses will be administered every 30 – 90 seconds until a  
MOAA/S score of <4 reached. Once a MOAA/S score of < [ADDRESS_302507] will perform 
endoscopic intubation and the goal will be to maintain a MOAA/S score of <4 until the procedure is over.

 90 seconds until the MOAA/S is <4. The measurements that will be made are the following: Elapsed time 
from initiation of induction to the first disappearance of expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559]2 on capnography, the 
incidence, severity, and time of oxygen desaturation, number of  airway maneuvers performed, duration 
of airway maneuvers, reason for performing the airway maneuver, the onset time of administration of 
sedation, the duration of the procedure, the total dosage of the medication, vital signs - blood pressure, 
heart rate,  and oxygen saturation, the time to full recovery, and patient cooperation. Nursing or the 
research assistant will document their patient’s depth of sedation, cooperation with procedure, and 
safety. Patients will recover in the endoscopy suite. The patient s will have continuous monitoring of heart 
rate, O2 saturation, and BP monitoring and MOAAS Score. The time to discharge will be obtained for each 
patient. Patients will also complete a satisfaction and pain questionnaire before they are discharged.  A 
statistician  using  student  T-test,  Fishers  exact  test,  and other  statistical  methods  they  deem appropriate 
will analyze the collected  data.

Group A (Standard care with a facemask) to Group B (SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2) group will occur when during 
the procedure either: 1) after insertion of an oral or nasal airway and hypoxia is persistent, and 2) before 
supraglottic airway endo trachea l tube insertion if the care team wishes.  
 
Group B to Group A: If any of the following occur: 1) patient refusal to wear the mask once placed due to 
claustrophobia, poor fit or discomfort or any other reason; 2) if a nasal or oral airway is needed.  
 
6. SUBJEC T WITHDRAWALS  
 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
1. Unacceptable adverse events (safety or  tolerability)  
2. The subject’s may withdraw from the study at any time and for any  reason  
3. Clinician decision that it is in the best interest of the subject to withdraw from the  study  
 
7. SAFETY AND REPORTABLE  EVENTS  
7.1 Adverse Event  Definition  
Adverse Event (AE) : An Adverse Event is any undesirable clinical event occurring to the subject during 
clinical study, whether or not it is considered related to the investigational product. This includes a 
change in a subject's condition or laboratory results, which has or  could have a deleterious effect on the 
subject's health or well -being. An Adverse Event that is related to the investigational device may be 
referred to as an Adverse Device Effect (ADE).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_302509] purposes, adverse events will be categorized at the investigative site into two groups: 
Serious Adverse Events, and Non -Serious Adverse Events. The Investigator as either related to the device 
or its deployment, or not related to the device or its deployment will assess the causal relatio nship of 
each adverse event. Each Adverse Event assessed as being related to the device or its deployment will 
also be assessed by [CONTACT_248788].  
 
7.3 An adverse event does not  include : 
• Medical or surgical procedures; t he condition that leads to the procedure is not an adverse  event  
• Pre-existing  disease,  conditions,  or laboratory  abnormalities  present  at the start  of the study  that do not 
worsen in frequency or  intensity  
• Situations  where  an untoward  medical  occurrence  has not occurred  (e.g.,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248781]/convenience  admissions)  
• Expected ICU  course  
 
7.[ADDRESS_302510]  (UADE)  
Any device related adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with or listed in the 
applicable product information (e.g., instructions for use, subject informed consent document, subject 
information brochure [if applicable], promotion al literature) or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/27/[ADDRESS_302512] (i.e., drug or device), contributing factors, and any action taken with respect to 
the study drug/device.  
 
Investigators and re search coordinators will be instructed that all AE and corresponding relevant 
information should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form. In addition, the clinical site will be 
responsible for notifying Sponsor within [ADDRESS_302513] all serious adverse experiences that occur during the study 
period in the appropriate source documents and/or AE log as applicable.  
 
8. RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT  
8.1 Potential  Risks  
As with use of all medical devices, complications may occur. Recognized risks associated with the use of 
the study intervention include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Allergic reactions: although the materials being used are hypoallergenic and th e risk is small, there 
remains a risk for an allergic reaction that may result in hives, swelling, or  anaphylaxis.  
• Ocular injury: although the SuperNO 2VA Et™ Mask was designed to contour away from the eyes, 
mishandling of the mask or accidental slippage fr om its intended position may result in contact [CONTACT_191839]’s eye, resulting in a corneal abrasion and/or other ocular  injury.  
• Pressure ulcer: although the clinical protocols states to remove the SuperNO 2VA Et™ after successful 
placement of an invasive  airway, if the SuperNO 2VA Et™ is mistakenly left on the subject for an 
extended period of time it can lead to a pressure  ulcer.  
 
8.2 Risks  Minimization  
• To minimize  the risk of allergic  reactions  the SuperNO 2VA Et™ has undergone  and successfully  passed 
biocompatibility  testing.  However,  there  is still a very  small  risk for an allergic  reaction  that may  result 
in hives, swelling, or  anaphylaxis.  
• To minimize the risk of an ocular injury, it is recommended that all clinicians be properly trained on 
how to use the SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2 and be familiar with the Instructions For Use  (IFU).  
• To minimize  the risk of a pressure,  it is recommended  that all clinicians  be properly  trained  on how  to 
use the SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2,  be familiar  with  the Instructions  For Use (IFU),  and monitor  the subject’s 
face for redness every 30 minutes that the SuperNO 2VA™ EtCO2 is secured to the  subject.  
 
8.3 Potential Benefits to  Subjects  
• Improved oxygen delivery, administration, and  oxygenation  
• Potentially able to reduce post -op respi[INVESTIGATOR_248782]: 22JUN21

 8.4 Alternatives to  Participation  
The alternative for not participating in this study is not using the SuperNO 2VA™ EtCO2 for gastrointestinal 
endoscopy.  
 
9. CONFIDENTIALIATY OF DATA AND INFORMATION  STORAGE  
All study participants will be assigned a study number. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_248783] a password locked UTH computer. Information about study subjects will be kept 
confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Patient data will be entered into a password protected electronic 
spreadsheet and online database (i.e. REDCap). Only the investigators, who have been invited to participate 
in the study  and who  are registered  with  the IRB, as well as have  documented  compl etion  of all IRB and HIPAA 
regulations will have access to patient data, but not the medical record  key. 
 
Electronic records will be stored for 5 years after study conclusion on the institution’s password protected 
computer, after which time they will be deleted. If there is a breach in confidentiality or violation of IRB and 
HIPAA regulations, the IRB will be  notified in a timely manner (within 7 days) and appropriate actions taken 
thereafter. All data used in the analysis and reporting of this investigation will be de -identified.  
 
In order to ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Account ability Act (HIPAA), all 
subjects enrolled in the study will be required to provide authorization to disclose Protected Health 
Information (PHI). This authorization will be included in the informed consent document as required by [CONTACT_5040]. In all study  reports  and in any resulting  publications,  subjects  will not be referred  to by [CONTACT_248789]/or 
study identification  number.  
 
The co -PIs will monitor for safety. Data safety will be ensured by [CONTACT_248790]. After randomization patient and study data outside the REDCaps system will 
only be identified by [CONTACT_5056]. Any recruitment data and randomization tables will be stored as a single 
copy in a locked cabinet in a PI’s secured Faculty offic e.

 4.1. Randomi zation  
A random  number  generator  program  will be used  to assign  sequential  qualified  study  cases  to control  group 
(N = 69) or SuperNO 2VA™EtCO2 group (N = 69) before collection of additional demographic information and 
before anesthetic and surgical care. A fter study group assignment, baseline data will be collected, including 
age, gender, height, weight, and  BMI.  
 
4.2. Planned Statistical  Analysis  
Although randomization into treatment groups should minimize differences between the groups, basic 
bivariate analyse s will be performed to determine if there are any clinical or demographic differences, using 
the data  collected  in table  1. Logistic  regression  models  will be performed  to determine  if there  are significant 
differences between the groups for both incidence  and severity. Student’s t -tests will be performed to 
determine  if there  is a significant  difference  between  groups  for duration,  with  Wilcoxon  non-parametric  tests 
being  performed  if the data  are non-linear.  If significant  differences  in clinical  or demographics  characteristics 
were found, multivariable models will be performed to adjust for these possible confounding variables using 
logistic regression and ANCOVA models (with GEE models being used to model non -linear data with the 
appropriate exponen tial family distribution). All analytic assumptions will be verified and all analyses 
performed with SAS v9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), analyzing the data as both per -protocol and intention -to- 
treat.  
 
A Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  will be convened  once  half the necessary  study  population 
has been enrolled, to discuss the current status of primary endpoints and adverse events, all of which will be 
tabulated throughout the study. If effect sizes are larger than originally planned and there is a statistically 
significant decrease in the primary event at this halfway mark, the study will end at this  time.  
 
5. ETHICS  
Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
Prior to participating in this investigation, the site will be required to obtain approval from its governing IRB. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_248784]. Prior to subject e nrollment, a signed copy of the IRB approval letter addressed to the 
Investigator certifying study approval must be submitted to the Sponsor. The IRB for this study is the local 
IRB at McGovern Medical School (University of [LOCATION_007] School of Medicine at Hous ton) The Investigator will 
report to the Sponsor immediately if, for any reason, the approval to conduct the investigation is withdrawn. 
This report will include a complete description of the reason(s) for which approval was withdrawn.  
 
6. DATA  MONITORING  
Data Review  
The Sponsor will review all CRFs for completeness and clarity upon receipt. Missing or unclear data will be 
requested as necessary throughout the study. The Sponsor will request further documentation such as 
physician procedure notes when UADEs  and/or malfunctions are observed and reported.  
 
The Sponsor will provide clinical monitoring including comparison of CRFs to source documentation for 
accuracy and appropriateness, review of/for adverse events, prompt evaluation of UADE, and site 
complianc e. To this end, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_248785]/or responsible government agencies.

 Prior to initiation of the study, sites will be trained on the clinical p rotocol, accepted clinical practices and 
Federal regulations pertaining to clinical research. Study sites will receive interim monitoring, as needed, 
and a final visit prior to study closure.  
 
Compliance and Deviations  
It is expected that sites (Investigat ors, study coordinators, ancillary site personnel, and study subjects) will 
be compliant with the study protocol. Should it be determined that the site is non -compliant, reasonable 
efforts will be made to secure compliance. These efforts/actions shall be d ocumented in writing and 
maintained within the study administration file at the Sponsor’s location.  
 
Should the site continue to remain non -compliant, the study Sponsor may restrict device availability and/or 
notify the governing IRB. Should efforts to bri ng the site into compliance fail, the site may be suspended 
from study participation until the noncompliance is resolved. Federal regulations require the Sponsor to 
report non -compliances in the study to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Therefore, i n the event of an 
Investigator or site suspension, the governing IRB and other appropriate regulatory authorities shall be 
notified.  
 
Protocol Deviations  
Protocol Deviations (PDs) will be documented on a Protocol Deviation Case Report Form. PDs are reporta ble 
to the institution's governing IRB and regulatory agencies during the annual reporting process, unless 
otherwise directed by [CONTACT_248791].  
Every attempt shall be made to adhere to th e study protocol. However, should an Investigator be required 
to deviate from the protocol to protect the life or physical well -being of a study subject in an emergent 
circumstance, such notice shall be given to the study Sponsor as soon as possible, but n o more than [ADDRESS_302517] ([CONTACT_248795], MD.), who is not a part of the study, will review adverse events, serious 
adverse and protocol deviations at the Lyndon B Johnson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Harris Health) site. These events and 
deviations will also be reported to the Mc Govern Medical School IRB as required. They will review all serious 
adverse events within [ADDRESS_302518] been randomized, an interim 
analysis will be completed to review efficacy of primary endpoint, adverse events,  serious adverse and protocol 
deviations. A final safety review will be performed once all the subjects complete the study.

PROTOCOL TITLE:  A Phase I/II Trial of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone for the 
treatment of subject s with previously treated AL Amyloidosis  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  PO-AMYL -PI-0024 
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:   
STUDY DRUG:  Pomalidomi de (CC-4047 ) 
INDICATION:  AL Amyloidosis  
STUDY PHASE:  I/II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:    
AL amyloidosis is a variant plasma cell disorder in which clonal bone marrow plasma 
cells produce immunoglobulin light chains that misfold into fibrils that are deposi ted in 
visceral organs, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.  Untreated, the disease has a 
median survival of only about one year. Oral treatment with melphalan and 
dexamethasone produces improvement in survival, with hematologic remissions and 
improv ement in organ function. Aggressive treatment with high dose intravenous 
melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) produces complete 
hematologic responses (CR) in about 40% of subject s and partial responses in a similar 
proportion; thes e are frequently accompanied by [CONTACT_404572]. Unfortunately only about half of referred subject s are eligible for HDM/SCT. 
Furthermore, it has been observed by [CONTACT_404573] a 
hematologic c omplete response after treatment with oral melphalan and dexamethasone 
as well as HDM/SCT is associated with improved survival, QOL, and clinical/organ 
response. Thus, we continue to seek more effective regimens for subject s ineligible for 
aggressive treat ment with HDM/SCT or not achieving a complete hematologic response 
to HDM/SCT or other modalities.  
 
The advent of novel agents in the treatment of multiple myeloma has changed the 
therapeutic landscape of plasma cell dyscrasias. Thalidomide has been studi ed as a single 
agent and in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of AL amyloidosis . 
Unfortunately, thalidomide is poorly tolerated with 50 -65% of subject s experiencing 
grade [ADDRESS_510065] s after HDM/SCT. Interim analysis of the first 34 subjects suggests 
achievement of a complete hematologic response CR in ~30% subject s and of partial

lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination. A variety of toxicities have been observe d, 
including leukopenia, rash, venous thrombosis, and intolerance to the dexamethasone. 
This report indicated better tolerability than thalidomide, however, 20% of subject s still 
stopped treatment with lenalidomide due to toxicities. We have extended our s tudy to 
subject s on dialysis, using attenuated doses, with good preliminary results. A study using 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and dexamethasone is ongoing; this study is 
not suitable for subject s with significant prior exposure to alkylator  agent.  
 
Pomalidomide (CC4047), a 2nd generation immun e-modulatory drug, has shown 
promising activity in phase -2 trial in combination with low -dose dexamethasone for 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. Responses were seen in 
50% of  subjects previously -failing thalidomide and/or lenalidomide  in AL amyloidosis.  
 
Given these promising results of pomalidomide in plasma cell dyscrasia s, we propose a 
study of pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in persons with previously -treated  
AL a myloidosis.  
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:    
 Determine dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maxim um tolerated dose 
(MTD) of pomalidomide combin ed with dexamethasone in p ersons with 
previously -treated light -chain (AL) -amyloidosis.  
Secondary:    
 Determine the following at the MTD : 
 Hematological complete (CR) very good partial (VGPR) and partial 
(PR) rates  
 Response -duration  
 Organ response  
 Time –to-event  
 Survival  
 
Exploratory:    
 To investigate the relationship of changes in the levels of the biomarkers 
BNP and tro ponin  I to frequency of specific adverse events and the 
occurrence of DLT.   
STUDY DESIGN:  
 Phase-I/II dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in p ersons  with 
previously -treated AL -amyloidosis.  During the Phase I  portion the MTD will be 
determined based on DLT s in the first cycle.  At the MTD an expanded cohort of 12 
subjects will be evaluated to estimate efficacy.

Protocol version 5/11/15  The study includes a screening period, a treatment (dose escalation) period, and a 
follow -up period for survival.  After givin g written informed consent, subject s will be 
evaluated for eligibility for enrollment in the study and baseline evaluations will be 
performed.  Subject s who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will begin study drug 
treatment with dose escalation.  Standard dose escalation rules will be used.  
Subject s will be monitored every cycle for safety, hematological status, and organ 
function during therapy or until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD).

Protocol version 5/11/15  3 Background and Rationale  
3.1 Introduction  
The dependence of tumor growth and metastasis on angiogenesis has been well 
characterized and has led to exploration of the role of anti -angiogenic  drugs (both small 
molecules and monoclonal antibodies) in the treatment of solid tumors.  Such agents have 
shown promise in both animal models and in preliminary studies of solid carcinomas in 
humans – including SCLC and non -SCLC [1,2].  Among these studie s, three sets of 
investigators have performed preliminary evaluations of thalidomide (an anti -angiogenic 
drug in the IMiD class) in combination with conventional induction chemotherapy and/or as 
mono -therapeutic, post -induction maintenance therapy in subje cts with newly diagnosed 
SCLC [3,4,5].  In each of these studies, some benefit with thalidomide use was detected – an 
increase in median survival (about 3 months overall) and/or 1 - and 2 -year survival relative 
to either parallel administration of or histor ic institutional control using equivalent 
conventional induction chemotherapy alone.  
Recently, the relative roles of enhanced expression/production of the inflammatory 
cytokines, including both cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) and tumor necrosis factor -alpha 
(TNF -alpha), in the up -regulation of lung cancer growth, the stimulation of metastasis, the 
inhibition of apoptosis and in the occurrence of paraneoplastic syndromes have been 
identified and investigated [6,7,8].   As a result of in vitro  and in vivo  studies on  lung and 
other carcinomas, inhibition of TNF -alpha and COX -[ADDRESS_510079] been identified, along with 
inhibition of angiogenesis, as therapeutic targets for limiting the growth, metastasis and 
neuro -endocrine complications of various solid carcinomas.  
The emergen ce of immunomodulatory agents , such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and more 
recently CC -4047 (pomalidomide), as effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404558] (MM). Following the approval and establishment of 
thalidomide -contai ning regimens, such as melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) 
and Thal/Dex, as the standard first -line therapy for newly diagnosed MM (NDMM), 
lenalidomide in combination with standard high -dose dexamethasone (RD) was approved 
for the treatment of subjects with previously treated MM. However, even with the newly 
approved agents including thalidomide, lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitor such as 
bortezomide, MM remains an incurable disease and most subject s will eventually relapse 
and progress after mul tiple lines of different therapeutic regimens.  
 
In addition, thalidomide, especially when combined with a corticosteroid, is effective in 
other diseases related to AL -amyloid including Waldentrom s macroglobulinemia, 
Castleman disease and POEMS (polyneurit is, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M -protein 
and osteosclerosis) syndrome.  Substantial data indicate thalidomide combined with a 
corticosteroid with or without an alkylating drug is active in newly -diagnosed and 
progressive AL -amyloidosis with responses ra tes of 20 -75 percent.  Preliminary data 
indicate lenalidomide and corticosteroids are active in AL -amyloidosis i ncluding subjects 
failing melpha lan (at all doses) and corticosteroids and also thalidomide and corticosteroids.  
 
           Page 12 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/[ADDRESS_510080] 10 -fold greater 
activity in inhibition of cellular COX -2 production and over 4,000 -fold greater activity in 
inhibition of cellular TNF -alpha production relative to thalidomide [9,10].   Pomalidomide  
has also been shown to stimulate antibody -dependent cytotoxic T -cell acti vity (ADCC) [9].   
At tolerated doses (MTD = 2 mg QD and 5 mg QOD), pomalidomide  has been shown to be 
active in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) (study CC -4047 -00-
001) [9,11,12].  In [ADDRESS_510081] commonly occurring dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) was reversible 
neutropenia.  As with other IMiDs administered to subjects receiving concomitant systemic 
steroids, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was seen (in 1subj ect each in this study and in its 
subsequent named subject  supply rollover program) [9,13].  
Recently, preliminary efficacy and safety data from an ongoing phase II study, led by 
[CONTACT_128738], et al, at Mayo Clinic, were published [14].  Sixty subject s with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled.  Pomalidomide (CC -4047) was given orally at a 
dose of [ADDRESS_510082] s achieved objective response (63%) including CR in [ADDRESS_510083] s (5%), VGPR in [ADDRESS_510084] s (28%), and PR in [ADDRESS_510085] s (30%) .   The CR + VGPR rate was 33%.  Grade [ADDRESS_510086] s (38%) and consisted of anemia in three 
subject s (5%), thrombocytopenia in two subject s (3%) and neutropenia in 21 (35%).  
Among those that developed grade 3/[ADDRESS_510087] experienced the neutropenia in 
cycle 1 -3; no new subject s experienced grade 3/[ADDRESS_510088] 
common non -hematological grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue (17%) and pneumonia (8%).  
Other grade 3/4 non -hematologi cal toxicities that occurred in less than 5% included 
diarrhea, constipation, hyperglycemia, and neuropathy.  One subject  (1.6%) had a 
thromboembolic event of deep vein thrombosis.   
Similarly , pre-clinical data and the prior experience with thalidomide an d lenalidomide in 
the treatment of subject s with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) provide the 
rationale for the use of pomalidomide in subject s with MMM. This is further supported by 
[CONTACT_109972] a Celgene sponsored trial (MMM -001) which indic ated that pomalidomide 
therapy at 0.5 mg or 2 mg/day +/ - an abbreviated course of prednisone is well tolerated in 
subject s with myelofibrosis and active in the treatment of anemia  [15].

were presented at ASH meeting in December 2010. Overall hematologic response rate is 
38% with [ADDRESS_510090] s achieving PR and 3 VGPR, including subjec ts failing prior 
lenalidomide and/or thalidomide. One year overall and progression free survival are 77% 
and 56% respectively. Twenty one of [ADDRESS_510091] s experienced > grade -[ADDRESS_510092] s with AL amyloidosis, including those failing 
lenalidomide and/or thalidomide.  
Complete and updated adverse events are available in the Investigational Drug Brochure and 
the IND Safety Letters.  
3.3 Rational e 
AL amyloidosis is a variant plasma cell disorder in which clonal bone marrow plasma cells 
produce immunoglobulin light chains that misfold into fibrils that are deposited in visceral 
organs, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.  Unt reated, the disease has a median 
survival of only about one year. Oral treatment with melphalan and dexamethasone 
produces improvement in survival, with hematologic remissions and improvement in organ 
function. Aggressive treatment with high dose intraveno us melphalan with autologous stem 
cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) produces complete hematologic responses (CR) in about 
40% of subject s and partial responses in a similar proportion; these are frequently 
accompanied by [CONTACT_404575]. Unfortunately only about 
half of referred subject s are eligible for HDM/SCT. Furthermore, it has been observed by [CONTACT_404576] a hematologic complete response after treatment 
with oral melphalan and dexamethasone  as well as HDM/SCT is associated with improved 
survival, QOL, and clinical/organ response. Thus, we continue to seek more effective 
regimens for subject s ineligible for aggressive treatment with HDM/SCT or not achieving a 
complete hematologic response to HDM/SCT or other modalities.  
 
The advent of novel agents in the treatment of multiple myeloma has changed the 
therapeutic landscape of plasma cell dyscrasias. Thalidomide has been studied as a single 
agent and in combination with dexamethasone for the tre atment of AL amyloidosis . 
Unfortunately, thalidomide is poorly tolerated with 50 -65% of subject s experiencing grade [ADDRESS_510093] s after HDM/SCT. Interim analysis of the first [ADDRESS_510094] s suggests 
achievement of a complete hematologic response CR in ~3 0% subject s and of partial 
hematologic response in ~40% subject s, with most responses occurring with the 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination. A variety of toxicities have been observed, 
including leukopenia, rash, venous thrombosis, and intolerance to t he dexamethasone. This 
report indicated better tolerability than thalidomide, however, 20% of subject s still stopped 
treatment with lenalidomide due to toxicities. We have extended our study to subject s on 
dialysis, using attenuated doses, with good prelim inary results. A study using lenalidomide

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15  in combination with melphalan and dexamethasone is ongoing; this study is not suitable for 
subject s with significant prior exposure to alkylator agent.  
 
Pomalidomide (CC4047), a third generation immunomodulatory a gent, has shown 
promising activity in phase II trial in combination with low -dose dexamethasone for 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma as well as AL amyloidosis. Furthermore, responses 
were seen in 50% of subject s who were refractory to prior IMiD in AL amyloidosis.  
 
Given these promising results of pomalidomide in plasma cell dyscrasia, we propose a study 
of pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in the treatment of subject s with previously 
treated AL  amyloidosis.

5.1 Overall design  
 
STUDY DESIGN:  
Phase  I/II dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and dex amethasone in persons with 
previously -treated AL -amyloidosis.  During the Phase I  portion the MTD will be determined 
based on DLT in the first cycle.  At the MTD an expanded cohort of 12 subjects will be 
evaluated to estimate efficacy.  
The study includes a  screening period, a treatment (dose escalation) period, and a follow -up 
period for survival.  After giving written informed consent, subjects will be evaluated for 
eligibility for enrollment in the study and baseline evaluations will be performed.  Subjec ts 
who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will begin study drug treatment with dose 
escalation.  Standard dose escalation rules will be used.  
Subjects will be monitored every cycle for safety, hematological status, and organ function 
during thera py or until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD).   
Treatment Group Assignments and Subject  Replacement  
This is a dose -escalation study and dose escalation will proceed through [ADDRESS_510095] 2 t reatment cycles are to be replaced.  
Subpopulations  
An additional 12 subjects will be enrolled in an expanded cohort for analysis of efficacy at 
each schedule studied.  
Subjects in this cohort will be treated at the dose defined as the MTD for that schedule.

5.1.1 Investigational Drug  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pomalidomide  
Pomalidomide , 4-amino -2-(2,6-dioxo -3-pi[INVESTIGATOR_285401])isoindoline -1’-one)-1,3-dione, belongs to 
the IMiDs class of compounds.  The Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number for 
CC-4047 is [ZIP_CODE] -19-8.  The chemical structure of the active pharmaceutical ing redient 
(API) is as follows:  
           Page 17 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/[ADDRESS_510097] as the optically active  
forms S ( -) and R (+).  Pomalidomide  is being developed as a racemate .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Mechanism of Action:  
Pomalidomide  is an IMiD analogue of thalidomide that, among other anti -tumor properties, 
on an equimolar basis in vitro, displays equivalent anti -angiogenic activity, about [ADDRESS_510098] 10 -fold greater activity in inhibition  of 
cellular COX -2 production and over 4,000 -fold greater activity in inhibition of cellular 
TNF -alpha production relative to thalidomide [9,10].   Pomalidomide  has also been shown 
to stimulate antibody -dependent cytotoxic T -cell activity (ADCC) [11].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose and tolerability : 
Pomalidomide was safe at doses of up to 50 mg in a Phase I  single dose study in normal, 
healthy male volunteers and up to 5 mg QOD or 2 mg QD in a Phase I  multidose clinical 
study in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myelom a; DLTs seen in subjects 
receiving higher doses were predominantly hematopoetic (i.e., neutropenia), and lower 
grade, self -limited neutropenia was also seen in some of the [ADDRESS_510099] a higher pomalidomide  MTD than subjects with hematologic 
malignancies.

5.6 Concomitant therapy    
5.6.1  Recommended concomitant therapy   
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, and antiemetics when appropriate.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti-coagulation Consideration   
Pomalidomide  increases the risk of thrombotic events in subject s who are at high risk or 
with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to cause 
thrombosis.  
Subjects will take aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 325 mg/day to prevent venous thrombosis while on 
pomalidomide.  Low molecular weight heparin may be utilized in subject s that are intolerant 
to ASA. Coumadin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  
5.6.2  Prohibited concomitant therap ies 
Concomitant use of sargramostim  (GM -CSF), other anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including 
radiation, thalidomide, or other investigational agents is not permitted while subjects are 
           Page 31 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15  receiving study drug during the treatment phase of the study.   G-CSF is not allowed during 
Phase I, Cycle 1 while evaluating for DLT.  However, G -CSF is allowed  for Phase II 
participants or following cycle 1 for Phase I participants . 
5.7 Discontinuation of Study -Treatment  
Treatment will continue until the occurrence of any of the following events.   
 Disease progression   
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the treatment regimen . 
 Major violation of the study protocol.  
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Lost to follow up  
 Death  
 Suspected pregnancy

Section 2 will be done.  
6 Adverse events  
6.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  
A serious advers e event is one that at any dose  (includi ng overdose):  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening 1 
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 2 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical  event 3 
           Page 32 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15   Suspected positive Pregnancy  
 
 1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious 
adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were  more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited re porting is 
appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404560] t o prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsi ons that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as 
medically important.  
6.2 Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Toxicity wi ll be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting .  
A copy of the CTCAE Version 4 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage 
(HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH .GOV ).  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_299798] , must be recorded, with details about the duration and 
intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken wit h respect to the test drug, and the subject ’s 
outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the 
test drug and for its seriousness.  
 
The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical  significance.  
If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator must 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the subject ’s 
outcome.  
 
AEs and SAEs will be reported from the firs t dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_510127]. All SAEs should continue to be monitored until they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es).   
 
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on pomalidomide  or within [ADDRESS_510128]’s last dose of pomalidomide are considered expedited reportable events.  If the 
subject is on pomalidomide , it is to be discontinued immediately and the subject is to be 
instructed to return any unused portion of pomalidomide  to the Investigator.  The pregnancy 
must be reported to Celgene Corporation Worldwide Drug Saf ety Surveillance (WWDSS) 
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_404584].

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/[ADDRESS_510129] notify 
Celgene Corporation Worldwide Drug Safety Surveillance (WWDSS) of the outcome as 
specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial 
SAE.  
 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontane ous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should 
follow the procedures for Expedited R eporting of SAEs to Celgene (i.e., report the event to 
Celgene Corporation Worldwide Drug Safety Surveillance (WWDSS) by [CONTACT_31950] 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  
 
Any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide  must be reported to Celgene within [ADDRESS_510130]  should be referred to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_510131] to 
causality, as S AEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects 
is related to the in utero  exposure to pomalidomide  should also be reported.  
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Corporation Worldwide Drug Safety 
Surveillance (WWDS S) should be advised as soon as the information is available.

7.2 Organ Response -Criteria:  
 
A subject  will be said to have had an organ response in an involved organ if any of the  
following criteria are met, and none of the criteria in Section 10 .4 are met.  
 
Kidney: 50% reduction in 24 -hour urine protein excretion in the absence of progressive  
renal insufficiency (defined as a 25% increase in serum creatinine, as long as that is  > to an 
absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL). In the case of nephrotic syn drome: a  decrease in proteinuria 
to < 1g/24h and an improvement in one of 2 extrarenal features – normalization of serum 
albumin or resolution of edema and/or discontinuation of diuretics  in response to 
improvement in edema.  
 
Heart : ≥ 2 mm reduction in the  interventricular septal (IVS) thickness by [CONTACT_6751],  
improvement of ejection fraction by ≥ 20% (echocardiogram must be performed at the  same 
institution), or decrease in 2 NYHA classes without increase in diuretic need (see  Appendix 
E for class defi nitions).  
 
Liver: ≥ 50% decrease in normalization of an initially elevated alkaline phosphatase level  or 
reduction in the size of the liver by [CONTACT_2669] 3 cm (determined by [CONTACT_404587]).  
 
Neuropathy: While neurotoxicity is acceptable for determining organ invo lvement, it will  
not be adequate for assessing organ response; organ response will be indeterminable for  
subject s in which neurotoxicity is the only site of organ involvement.  
 
Gastrointestinal Tract: While GI involvement is acceptable for determining orga n 
involvement, it will not be adequate for assessing organ response: organ response will  be 
indeterminable for subject s in which GI is the only site of organ involvement.  
 
8 Protocol Amendments/Deviations  
8.[ADDRESS_510140] be agreed to by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_404561].  Amendments should only be submitted to IRB/EC after 
consideration of Celgene review.  Written verification of IRB  approval will be obtained 
before any amendment is impleme nted.

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/[ADDRESS_510141] (for whom t he deviation from protocol was effected) is 
to continue in the study.  The subject’s medical records will completely describe the 
deviation from the protocol and state the reasons for such deviation.  In addition, the 
Investigator will notify the IRB  in wr iting of such deviation from protocol.  
Non-emergency minor deviations from the protocol will be permitted with approval of the 
Principal Investigator.  
9 Data Management  
9.1 Analyses and Reporting  
Data will be analyzed and reported after study is completed or me aningful endpoints are 
reached. All subsequent data collected will be analyzed and reported in a follow -up clinical 
report.   
9.2 Data Monitoring Committee  
Toxicity and accrual monitoring will be performed on a routine basis by [CONTACT_404588] a s the multidisciplinary members of the Amyloid Treatment and 
Research Program at [LOCATION_011] University, which has over 40 years’ experience in the 
treatment of AL amyloidosis.  Subject s will undergo toxicity assessment, performance status 
assessment and labora tory tests before beginning each new cycle.  Response assessment will 
be conducted every three cycles.  The clinical status and laboratory reports of the study 
participants will be reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_22888] -investigators at the weekly  meetings of the 
Stem Cell Transplant Program and reviewed by [CONTACT_404589].  
Dose modifications/interruptions or discontinuation will be implemented according to 
Section 5. 5.  
 
In addition, the BMC  Cancer Center ’s Internal Data and Safety Monitoring  Committee 
(DSMC) will review the protocol, and will determine review frequency based on level of 
risk.  The protocol will be reviewed at least annually by [CONTACT_6802]. Please see full DSMB 
Charter in Appendix 4.

Protocol version 5/11/15  9.3 Study monitoring and auditing  
9.3.1  Investigator responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  
Investigators must enter study data onto CRFs or other data collection system.  The 
Investi gator will permit study -related monitoring visits and audits by [CONTACT_404590], IRB/EC review, and regulatory inspec tion(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), 
providing direct access to the facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to 
CRFs, and to all other study documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at 
some time during monitoring visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow 
direct access to the subject’s reco rds (e.g., medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], 
and study related charts) for source data verification.  The data collection must be completed 
prior to each visit and be made available to the Celgene representative so that the accuracy 
and comp leteness may be checked.  
10   Statis tical Plan  
10.1 Overview  
This is a P hase I/II study . Responses and toxicity will be compared informally to th ose 
reported lenalidomide  and dexamethasone combin ed. 
 
The Phase I portion of the study will be aimed at determ ining the safety profile and the 
MTD of pomalidomide . A 3+[ADDRESS_510142] s will 
receive escalating doses of pomalidomide orally on D1 -21 in a 28 -day cycle in the absence 
of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. * Pomalidomide has been safely given to 
persons with relapsed/refractory myeloma subject s at 2  mg/day continuously  in a small 
Phase II study. Therefore, the estimated safe starting dose of pomalidomide will be 2 
mg/day continuously . DLTs will be assessed i n Cycle 1 only. Dose escalation of 
pomalidomide will continue until MTD has been identified or a maximum planned dose (4 
mg/day continuously ) is determined to be safe.  
 
* Pomalidomide dosing for Phase I cohorts 1 and 2 given on days 1 -28 of a 28 -day cycle and changed to Days 
1-21 of a 28 day cycle with Cohort 3.

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/[ADDRESS_510143] cycle; toxicity considered by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator to be related to 
pomalidomide ; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia; > Grade [ADDRESS_510144] s (ie, the dose 
level below that at which DLT was established).  
Data to be included in the analysis for the hematologic  response endpoint include evaluation 
of serum free light chain assay, monoclonal protein in serum or urine by [CONTACT_404591], percentage of plasma cells and presence of clonal dominanc e of kappa or 
lambda isotope on bone marrow biopsy.    
Data for the secondary endpoint of organ response will include creatinine and [ADDRESS_510145] s could potentially be enrolled.  
 
It is expected that approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in the phase I/II portions of this 
study.  The endpoints measured in the protocol will be overall response rate (ORR) 
determined by [CONTACT_404592], VGPR or PR and response of one or more organs.    It is estimated 
by [CONTACT_16310]’s approximate frequency of response in 18 patients (6 patients 
will be dosed at the MTD during the phase I portion of this trial plus the additional 12 
patients at this MTD dose during the phase II p ortion).   Using the adjusted Wald’s 
confidence interval for the proportion and the corresponding point estimates for hypothetical 
data, it is expected that if [ADDRESS_510146] ORR then the estimated response rate would be 
35.57% with a 90% confidence inte rval between 18.21% and 52.81% with similar estimates 
for organ response.

Safety Analysis  
 
 Determination of MTD  
 
The determination of MTD  will be achieved by [CONTACT_109972] a deterministic algorithm ; thus, 
statis tical hypothesis testing is not intended.  
 
The evaluation of MTD  will be based on data from subject s who receive pomalidom ide and whose 
data are interpretable in the context of study drug -specific toxicity (ie, subject s should have had 
suffic ient safety assessments performed to determine whether DLT  occurred and should not have 
received alternate antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404562]  1).  Subject s who are withdrawn from the 
study for reasons other than DLT  before completing cycle  [ADDRESS_510148] s will be analyzed according to the dose actually 
received.  
 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics  
Not applicable.  
 
Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy analysis will be based on confirmed hema tological response and confirmed organ 
response.  The analysis of response data at the MTD  will be descriptive, consisting of 2 -sided 90% 
confidence intervals.  
 
Additional analyses of efficacy data at the MTD  will consist of evaluations of time to hematolo gic 
response, duration of hematologic response, and time to worsening of hematologic and/or organ 
function.  These analyses will also be descriptive in nature.

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15  Analysis of the rates of responders for each of the other dose levels will also be presented, w ithout 
calculation of confidence intervals.  
 
Exploratory Analysis  
An exploratory analysis will be conducted to investigate the relationship of changes in the 
levels of the biomarkers brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I to the frequency of 
specif ic AEs and the occurrence of DLT.  Additionally, the benefit, if any, of using these 
measures in addition to routine monitoring by [CONTACT_404593].  
The frequency of conversion in immunofixation results from positive to negative wil l be 
explored and the disappearance of free light chain.  Efficacy at additional doses may be 
explored for potential use in future Phase II clinical trials.  
 
Interim Analysis  
Interim analyses will be performed following each cohort during the Phase I porti on of the 
study.  No interim analysis is planned for the Phase II portion.  
10.[ADDRESS_510149] ug(s) and had this 
confirmed, will not be evaluated for safety.  
The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to th e NCI CTCAE v4 .[ADDRESS_510150] s treated at the MTD experience a response, consideration 
will be made to terminate the study.  Accrual will not be placed o n hold during efficacy 
evaluation.

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15  Pomalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
Pomalidomide was found to  be teratogenic in a developmental study in rabbits.  
Pomalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that 
causes severe life -threatening human birth defects.  If Pomalidomide is taken during 
pregnancy, it may cause birt h defects or death to an unborn baby.  
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not  been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing 
potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months).  
Counselling  
For a female of childbeari ng potential, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the 
following are met (ie, all females of childbearing potential must be counselled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to the start of pomalidomide study therapy):  
 She understa nds the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
 She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 28 
days before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study 
treatment, dose interruption and 28 days aft er the end of study treatment  
 She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures  
 She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and 
the need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnan cy 
 She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug 
is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test  
 She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this protocol  
 She acknow ledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of pomalidomide  
The investigator must ensure that females of childbearing potential:  
 Comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including 
confirmatio n that she has an adequate level of understanding  
 Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements  
For a female NOT of childbearing potential, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of 
the following are met (ie, all females NOT of childbearing potential mus t be counselled 
concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of pomalidomide study 
therapy):  
           Page 50 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15   She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of pomalidomide  
The effect of pomalidomi de on spermatogenesis is not known and has not been studied. 
Therefore, male subject s taking pomalidomide must meet the following conditions (ie, all 
males must be counselled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start 
of pomalidomid e study therapy):  
 Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential  
 Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if 
engaged in sexual activity  with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two 
reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from 
heterosexual contact [CONTACT_137810]: 1) for at least 28 
days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; 
and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_510156] include one highly effective method and 
one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effect ive and 
additional effective methods of contraception:    
 Highly effective methods:  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
 Tubal ligation  
 Partner’s vasectomy  
 Additional effective methods:  
 Male condom  
 Diaphragm  
 Cervica l Cap  
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in subject s with multiple 
myeloma taking pomalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_196989]. If a subject  is currently using combined oral contraception the subject  
should switch to another one of the effective methods listed above. The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4−6  weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. 
The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co -treatment with 
dexamethasone.

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15  Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased 
risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic 
antibiotics should be considered particularly in subjec ts with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of  25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential 
who commit to complete abstinence, as  outlined below.  
Before starting study drug  
Female Subject s: 
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
starting study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within [ADDRESS_510157] s: 
Must practice complete abstinence or  agree to use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during 
dose interruptions and for at least [ADDRESS_510158] s: 
 FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
weekly for the first [ADDRESS_510159] 28 days and then every 1 4 days while on study, at 
study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug 
discontinuation.   
 At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing 
to use two reliable methods of birth control.   
 Counselling abo ut pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure 
must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.  
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject , study 
drug must be immediately discontinued.  
 Pregnancy testing and  counselling must be performed if a subject  misses her 
period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Study 
drug treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.  
 Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study p articipation and 
for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

 Counselling about the requirement for complete abstinence or condom use 
during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490]  a pregnant female or a female of childbearing 
potential and the potent ial risks of fetal exposure to pomalidomide must be 
conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.   
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male 
study subject  during study participation, the investigator must be notified 
immedia tely. 
Additional precautions  
 Subject s should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another 
person and to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at the end of 
treatment.  
 Subject s should not donate blood during therapy and for at leas t 28 days 
following discontinuation of study drug.  
 Male subject s should not donate semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 90 
days following discontinuation of study drug.  
 Only enough study drug for one cycle of therapy may be dispensed with each 
cycle of therapy.

Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/[ADDRESS_510163] important information I should know about 
pomalidomide?  
1. Pomalidomide may cause birth defects (deformed bab ies) or death of an 
unborn baby.  Pomalidomide is similar to the medicine thalidomide. It is 
known that thalidomide causes life -threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide 
has not been tested in pregnant women but may also cause birth defects.  
Pomalidomide was found to cause birth defects when tested in pregnant 
rabbits.  If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:  
 Do not take study drug if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant  
 You must either not have any sexual relations with a man or use two 
reliable, separate forms of effective birth control at the same time:  
 for 28 days before starting study drug  
 while taking study drug  
 during dose interruptions of study drug  
 for 28 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743]  
 You must  have pregnancy testing done at the following times:  
 within 10 – [ADDRESS_510164] dose of study drug  
 weekly for the first 28 days  
 every [ADDRESS_510165] irregular 
menstrual periods  
 if you miss your period or have unusual  menstrual bleeding  
 [ADDRESS_510166] dose of study drug ([ADDRESS_510167] dose if 
menstrual periods are irregular)  
 Stop taking study  drug if you become pregnant during treatment  
 If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the stud y, you must stop 
study drug immediately and immediately inform your study doctor. The 
study doctor will report all cases of pregnancy to Celgene Corporation.  
 Do not breastfeed while taking study drug  
           Page 58 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15   The study doctor will be able to advise you where to ge t additional advice on 
contraception.  
If you are a female not of childbearing potential:  
In order to ensure that an unborn baby [CONTACT_403357], your study 
doctor will confirm that you are not able to become pregnant.  
If you are a male:  
The effect of pomalidomide on sperm development is not known and has not been 
studied. The risk to the fetus in females of child bearing potential whose male 
partner is receiving pomalidomide is unknown at this time.   
1. Male patients (including those who have h ad a vasectomy) must 
either not have any sexual relations with a pregnant female or a 
female who can become pregnant, or must use a condom during 
sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a pregnant female or a female that can become 
pregnant:  
o While you are taking study drug  
o During dose interruptions of study drug  
o For [ADDRESS_510168] immediately inform your study doctor. The 
study doctor will report all cases of pregnancy to Celgene 
Corporation.  Your partner should call their healthcare provider 
immediately if they get pregnant.  
2. Restrictions in sharing study drug and donating blood:  
1. Do not share study drug with other people. It must be kept out of 
the reach of children and should never be given to any other 
person.  
2. Do not donate blood  while you take study drug and for 28 days after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743].  
3. Do not  break, chew, or open study drug capsules.  
4. You will be supplied with no more than one cycle of study drug  
5. Return unused study drug capsules to your study doctor.

Mission:  
The Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committe e (DSMC) functions to ensure the 
safety of participants in investigator -initiated, interventional clinical trials conducted by 
[CONTACT_404598], 
validity and integrity of the data collected  on clinical trials  under its jurisdiction.  The 
committee ensures compliance with FDA, NCI and IRB requirements. The policies and 
procedures of the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee follow NCI guidelines.  
 
Background:  
All cancer related interventional  protocols from any department must be reviewed by [CONTACT_404599] (SRC).  This includes trials that are recruiting 
individuals to cancer prevention or detection; treatment of disease or symptoms; and 
studies of cancer survivo rs, i.e. people who have had a previous diagnosis of cancer.   
 
At the time it approves a new investigator -initiated, interventional protocol, the SRC assigns 
a category of risk that determines the level of monitoring required by [CONTACT_6802] . The level 
of ris k (low, moderate high) is based on a number of criteria, including the expected 
duration of the study based on the study design and a realistic estimate of the rate of 
enrollment; the nature of the study population ( e.g., prisoners, pregnant women); 
proced ures to ensure the safety of subjects in accordance with the degree of risk; the 
complexity of methods needed to ensure the validity and integrity of the data; and planned 
data management systems including case report forms, records and the plan for data 
collection. Multiple -site studies must also have an operational plan that describes the 
procedures for reporting serious adverse events to the Cancer Clinical Trials Program 
(CCTP), IRB, FDA, and NIH, as appropriate, and plans for notifying participants of trial 
results and communicating relevant study information to participants’ health providers ( e.g., 
cessation of drugs, changes in dosage, etc.)  
 
Prior to implementation, all studies in need of internal monitoring must have a monitoring 
plan approved by t he SRC, including frequency of reviews based on the level of risk and 
accrual target. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], high -risk studies are reviewed quarterly by [CONTACT_6802], moderate 
           Page 62 of 66  
Pomalidomide                           Protocol:  
Protocol version 5/11/15  risk studies are reviewed twice each year, and low risk studies are reviewed annually. 
However, each study is considered independently. Implementation of monitoring plans 
approved by [CONTACT_404600]. The DSMC Coordinator manages 
the logistics associated with DSMC sessions.  
 
Two months prior to a scheduled DSMC review, the PR MS Administrator informs the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404564].  At this time, 
the research staff is requested to submit a completed DSMC Report Form (Appendix I) and 
associated documents to the PRMS Administrator (for each DSMC review).   
 
In addition to being monitored by [CONTACT_6802], clinical studies also undergo annual auditing 
by [CONTACT_12217] (see below).  Two months prior to an annual DSMC review, the PRMS 
Administrator informs the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404565] s tudy coordinator to prepare 
protocol documents for audit and informs the PRMS Audit Committee that an audit is due.  
The Audit Committee audits 10% of charts for a given year, or a minimum of three charts, 
to assess fidelity to the approved protocol, study  documentation, timeliness of adverse 
reporting, accuracy of data collection, and other variables.  The audit report, which lists all 
major and lesser deviations from protocol, is submitted to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404566].   
 
One month prior to the DSMC Meeting, the PRMS Administrator distributes pertinent 
documents to the Committee members, including.   
 Completed DSMC Form (Appendix I)  
 Electronic copy of the protocol  
 Spreadsheet including: date of enrollment, patient initials, patient number,  gender, 
age, race, status on study ( i.e., active, follow -up, completed, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697])  
 A copy of the Data Safety Monitoring Plan outlined in the INSPIR application.  
 SAE reports,  follow -up reports, and outcome reports  
 Audit Committee Report (if annual review)  
 
Responsibilities of the DSMC  
 Familiarize themselves with the research protocol(s) and review proposed plans for 
data safety monitoring, and protocol data submitted by [CONTACT_16133].  
 Review annual audit report from the PRMS Audit Committee to evalua te the 
appropriateness of th e conduct of the study.   
 When applicable, review interim analyses of toxicity data prepared by [CONTACT_404601]. 
Recommendations regarding study modi fication, or termination of study accrual based 
on these analyses can be made at that time by [CONTACT_6802]. Modifications may include 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a treatment arm based on toxicity results, dose adjustment, increasing or 
decreasing sample size, etc.   
 Provide the PI [INVESTIGATOR_404567] S cientific Review Committee with a written 
report following each DSMC meeting summarizing its review of the trial as related to 
the cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to 
continuing , amending or terminating accrual to the trial.

DSMC Procedures  
 
The DSMC may vote to take one of the following actions for each prot ocol reviewed:  
 
Full Approval: enrollment may continue; no outstanding questions regarding toxicity or 
accrual.  
 
Conditional Approval: enrollment may continue conditional upon satisfactory response by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_404569]/or accrual and/or 
new information relevant to the trial.  
 
Suspension: enrollment immediately suspended pending principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404570]/or accrual patterns.  
 
Closure: study closed due to unacceptable toxicity and/or accrual patterns. The presence 
of three or more of the DSMC voting members constitutes a quorum.  
 
All DSMC decisions are conveyed in writing to the study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404571].

TITLE  A Phase  3 randomized, open -label, multicenter study comparing isatuximab  
(SAR650984)  in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone versus pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in 
patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma  
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION  Worldwide  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  3 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)  
 Primary objective:  
To demonstrate the benefit of isatuximab in combination with 
pomalidomide and low -dose dexamethasone in the prolongation of 
Progression Free Survival (PFS ) as c ompared to pomalidomide and 
low-dose dexamethasone in patients with refractory or relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  (MM) . 
Key Secondary objective(s):  
• To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (ORR)   as per 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG ) criteria in each 
arm 
• To compare the Overall Survival (OS) between the two arms  
Other Secondary objective(s):  
• To evaluate the Time t o Progression (TTP) in each arm  
• To evaluate the PFS in high risk cytogenetic populatio n defined 
as patients carrying del( 17p), t(4;14), t(14;16) in each arm  
• To evaluate the Duration of Response (DOR) in each arm  
• To evaluate safety in both treatment arms  
• To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK ) profile of isatuximab in 
combination with pomalidomide  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab  
• To assess disease -specific and a generic health -related qual ity of 
life (HRQL), disease and treatment -related symptoms, health 
state utility and health status.  
Exploratory objective(s):  
• To explore the relationship between immune genetic 
determinants and efficacy  endpoints  
• To explore PK and pharmacodynamic (PD y) relationships  
• To explore the minimal residual disease (MRD ) rate in both 
treatment arms

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 07   26-Nov-2020  
EFC14335  - isatuximab  Version number: [ADDRESS_1083528] two prior lines including lenalidomide 
and a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib, carfilzomib or ixazomib) alone or 
in combination, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 
[ADDRESS_1083529] therapy.  
Randomization/treatment arms:  
After confirmation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomly assigned 
using interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:1  ratio to one of the two 
arms:  
• Isatuximab in c ombination with pomalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone (IPd, experimental arm)  
• Pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Pd, control arm)  
Isatuximab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone are defined in this 
protocol as “study treatments”.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<75 years versus ≥75 years) and 
number of previous lines  of therapy (two or three versus more than three).  
A complete transplant procedure (induction, mobilization, co nditioning, 
transplant, consolidation and maintenance) will be considered as one line. 
Each other regimen will be considered as one line, whatever the reason of 
discontinuation (progression, adverse event or patient request) . 
Duration of therapy  
Patients w ill be allowed to continue therapy until disease progression, 
unacceptable adverse events (AEs)  or patient wish , whichever comes 
first. 
STUDY POPULATION  
Selection criteria  Inclusion criteria:  
Eligible patients will be considered for inclusion in this study if they meet 
all of the following criteria:

ENDPOINT(S)  
 Primary endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is PFS. Progression free survival  is defined as the 
time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of 
progressive  disease  (PD) (as determined by [CONTACT_941] I ndependent Response  
Committee  [IRC]) or the date of  death from any cause , whichever comes 
first. Response will be determined according to International Myeloma 
Working Group (IMWG) criteria  (1). Progression will be confirmed based 
on two consecutive assessments.  
Key Secondary endpoint(s):  
• Overall Response Rate (ORR) : defined as the proportion of 
patients with stringent complete response (sCR), complete 
response (CR ), very good partial response (VGPR ), and partial 
response (PR) as assessed by [CONTACT_32629] C using the IMWG response 
criteria  
• Overall Survival (OS ): defined as the time from the date of 
randomi zation to death from any cause  
Other Secondary end points : 
• Time to Progression  (TTP)  defined as time from randomization to 
the date of first documentation of PD (as determined by [CONTACT_26732] ) 
• PFS as defined above in the high risk cytogenetic population 
patients carrying del(17p), t(4;14), t (14;16) determined by 
[CONTACT_26707] ( FISH )  
• Duration of response  (DOR) : defined as the time from the date of 
the first IRC determined response to the date of first IRC -PD or 
death, whichever happens first. DOR will not be calculated for 
patients that do not achieve a response  
• Safety in terms of treatment -emergent AEs/serious adverse 
events (TEAE /SAE ), laboratory parameters, and vital signs and 
assessment of physical examination, infusion associated 
reactions (IAR ), second primary malignancies. TEAEs are defined 
as AEs that develop, worsen (according to the Investigator

• Pharmacokinetic evaluation : blood samples will be collected in all 
patients treated with isatuximab using a sparse s ampling strategy 
in order to assess the PK profile of isatuximab using population 
PK approach. This analysis will involve an estimation of 
inter-patient PK variability , inter-occasion PK variability, the 
population PK parameters estimates and the assessmen t of 
pomalidomide and pathophysiologic covariate effects on the main 
PK parameters. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_787605] (AUC : Area Under th e 
Curve) will a lso be performed  
• Presence of isatuximab Anti -Drug Antibodies ( ADA) in the IPd 
arm will be assessed throughout the study . For patients still on 
treatment at the time of amended protocol 07, sample is no m ore 
required  
• The QLQ -C30, MY20 and EQ -5D-5L assessments will be 
captured electronically throughout the study . All patient reported 
outcomes (PRO ) are to be completed by [CONTACT_102] s at the 
center s prior to discussing their health/disease status, and prior to 
administration of study treatments, or other study -related 
procedures  during treatment, at end of treatment visit (EOT; 
30 [±5] days after last study treatment administration ) and 
60 days (±5 days) after last study treatment administration : 
- Disease -specific HRQL will be assessed using the EORTC 
QLQ -C30

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Sample size determination:  
Progression Free Survival : Assuming proportional hazards, a total of 
[ADDRESS_1083547] at the one sided 0.025 level with a 90% power. Based on an 
anticipated median PFS time of 4  months in the Pd arm; this is expected 
to correspond to a median PFS of 6.67 months in the IPd arm.  
Overall Survival : Assu ming proportional hazards, a total of [ADDRESS_1083548] at the one sided 0.025  level with 79.3% power. Calculation takes into 
account an interim analysis on OS at the time of PFS analysi s and one 
additional interim analysis of OS when approximately 90% of [ADDRESS_1083549] occurred . Based on an anticipated median OS time of 13  months in 
the Pd arm; this is expected to correspond to a difference of 6  months in 
median OS between the Pd arm an d the IPd arm.  
A maximum of 300 patients (150 in each arm) would be adequate to 
achieve the targeted number of events for both PFS and OS. Assuming a 
uniform accrual rate of [ADDRESS_1083550] patient in (FPI ) respectively.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 15  Main analysis populations : 
Intent -to-treat (ITT ) population : this population will include all patients 
who have given their informed consent and for whom there is 
a confirmation of successful allocation of a randomization number by [CONTACT_21436]. This population is the primary population for all efficacy parameters. 
All analyses using this population will be based on the treatment assigned 
at randomization.  
All treated (AT )/safety population : this population will include ITT 
patients who have actually received at least one dos e or a part of a dose 
of the study treatment. This population is the primary population for the 
analysis of all safety parameters. All analyses using this population will be 
based on the treatment actually received.  
PRO population:  is defined as the AT pop ulation who have completed 
the baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) and at least [ADDRESS_1083551] baseline assessment for 
each of the three selected ePROs (EORTC QLQ -C30, MY20 and  
EQ-5D-5L). 
Analysis of primary eff icacy endpoint:  
The primary analysis of PFS will be based on th e following censoring 
rules:  
If progression and death are not observed before the analysis cut -off date, 
PFS will be censored at the date of the last valid disease assessment not 
showing disease progression performed prior to initiation of a new anti -
myelo ma treatment (if any) and the analysis cut -off date, whichever 
comes first.  
PFS in the IPd arm will be compared to the Pd arm using the log -rank test 
procedure stratified by [CONTACT_787654] 0.025.  
The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CI ) will be provided using the Cox proportional hazard model 
stratified by [CONTACT_787655]. The me dian PFS 
and probabilities of being progression free at different time points 
calculated using the Kaplan -Meier methods as well as corresponding 
CI will be presented by [CONTACT_2939]. The Kaplan -Meier PFS curves will 
also be provided.  
Sensitivity analyses of PFS will be performed (eg, different censoring 
rules and PFS assessed by [CONTACT_737]).  
Cut-off date for primary analysis of PFS will be the date when 162 PFS 
events are observed.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints:  
Best overall response, ORR and clini cal benefit rate (CBR ) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_2890]. The 95% 
two-sided CI will be computed for ORR and CBR using the 
Clopper -Pearson method. Overall response rate w ill be compared 
between treatment groups using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel stratified 
method. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients with 
sCR, CR, VGPR, PR or minimal response (MR) according to IMWG 
criteria, as determined by [CONTACT_32629] C. 
The analysis of OS will be similar to that described for PFS and will be 
based on the following censoring rules: Patients without death prior to the 
analysis cut -off date will be censored at the last date the patient was

EFC14335  - isatuximab  Version number: [ADDRESS_1083552]. The final OS 
analysis (based on 220  deaths) is expected to be performed 
approximately 33  months after the final PFS analysis cut -off date 
(ie, [ADDRESS_1083553] patient in).  
The analysis of DOR will be similar to that describ ed for PFS. The same 
censoring rules as PFS will be used.  
Analysis of PRO endpoints:  
• Disease -specific HRQL (EORTC QLQ -C30) will be assessed via 
a comparison of C30 health -related quality -of-life change scores 
from baseline to EOT and [ADDRESS_1083554] stu dy treatment 
administration between treatment arms. In addition responder 
analyses will be conducted: 1. for those who improve and 2 for 
those who deteriorate utilizing the clinical important differences 
(CID) defined in Appendix H for all C30 HRQL summary and 
subscale scores for both treatment arms.  
• Disease - and treatment -related symptoms (EORTC QLQ -C30 
and MY20) will be assessed via a com parison of change scores 
in C30 (individual symptom change scores) and MY20 (disease - 
and treatment -related summary scores) from baseline to EOT and 
[ADDRESS_1083555] study treatment administration  between 
treatment arms. In addition responder analyses wi ll be conducted 
1 for those who improve and 2 for those who deteriorate utilizing 
the CIDs defined in Appendix H  for all individual symptom scores 
(C30) and disease - and treatment -related summary scores 
(MY20) for both treatment arms ( Appendix I ). 
• Health stat e utility (EQ -5D-5L) will be assessed via a comparison 
of health state utility change scores from baseline to EOT and 
[ADDRESS_1083556] study treatment administration  between 
treatment arms. In addition responder analyses will be conducted 
1 for those who  improve and 2 for those who deteriorate utilizing 
the CIDs defined in Appendix J for health state utility scores for 
both treatment arms.  
• Health status (EQ -5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale) will be assessed 
via a comparison of EQ -5D-5L health status change scores from 
baseline to EOT and [ADDRESS_1083557] study treatment 
administration  between treatment arms. In addition responder 
analyses will be cond ucted 1 for those who improve and 2 for 
those who deteriorate utilizing the CIDs defined in Appendix J  for 
health status VAS scores for both treatme nt arms.  
• Clinically meaningful improvements for each PRO are defined 
(based on CIDs) in Appendix H , Appendix I  and Appendix J . 
Analysis of the safety endpoints : 
Number (%) of patients experiencing TEAEs by [CONTACT_787656] (all grades 
and ≥  Grade 3) for the safety population. The same summaries will be 
prepared for drug -related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, TEAEs leading to dose modification, serious TEAEs and 
TEAEs with fatal outcome. For patients with multiple occurrences of the 
same AE within the on -treatment period, the worst grade will be used.

abnormalities (ie, all grades and ≥  Grade 3) using the worst grade during 
the on -treatment period will be provided for the safety population. Second 
primary malign ancies will be analyzed throughout the study.  
Interim analysis  
An interim analysis for efficacy assessment on OS is planned at the time 
of primary analysis on PFS which is estimated to occur when  about 42% 
of the OS events have been  observed  and a second i nterim analysis is 
planned when approximately 90% of the OS events have occurred . An 
O’Brien and Fleming  α-spending function will be used to obtain the 
nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses of survival . 
Planned database lock date : 
Estimated c ut-off date for primary analysis of PFS will be approximately 
18 months after FPI.  
The estimated cut -off date for the second OS interim analysis will be 
approximately 43 months after FPI.  
The estimated  final analysis cut -off date for OS analysis  will be  
approximately  51 months after FPI.  
DURATION OF  STUDY PERIOD 
(per patient)  The duration of the study for a patient will include a period for screening of 
up to 21 days (or up to 28 days  for FCBP) . The cycle duration is [ADDRESS_1083558] dose of study treatment for assessments including 
ADA (IPd arm only) . If ADA test at Day  [ADDRESS_1083559] at the second cycle administered 
without isatuximab is positive or inconclusive, ADA testing will be 
repeated every cycle until ne gative . 
During follow -up (FU), patients who discontinue the study treatment due 
to PD will be followed every 3 months (12 weeks) for further anti -myeloma 
therapy, second primary malignancies, and survival until death or OS 
cut-off date, whichever comes fir st. Patients who discontinue the study 
treatment prior to documentation of PD will be followed -up monthly  until 
confirmation of PD  (even for patients who would initiate further anti -
myeloma therapy without PD) , and then after confirmation of disease 
progre ssion, every 3  months (12 weeks) for further anti -myeloma therapy, 
second primary malignancies, and survival, until death or OS cut-off date, 
whichever comes first.  
Cut-off date for PFS analysis will be the date when the [ADDRESS_1083560] occur red. 
If a patient is still on treatment at the time of the cut -off date  for OS  and 
benefit ting from the study treatment, the patient can continue the study 
treatment until disease progression, unacceptable AEs, patient wish, or 
any other reason. For cycles completed after the cut -off date, study

administration. At [ADDRESS_1083571] is positive or inconclusi ve, additional ADA samples are required every  30 days (± 7 days) until sample is negative. If isatuximab is stopped prior to pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone, ADA will be tested on D ay [ADDRESS_1083572] at the second cycle administered witho ut isatuximab is positive or inconclusive, ADA testing will be repeated every cycle until 
negative . 
w Isatuximab IAR labs : (TNF - α, IL-1-β, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN -γ) baseline sample to be drawn prior to first isatuximab administration at Cycle  1. Then if a isat uximab infusion associated reaction (IAR)  
of ≥ Grade 2 occurs, additional blood sampling during the AE is required for analysis of cytokine release (TNF -α, IL-1-β, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN -γ), markers of complement activation (C3a, C4, CH50 ) and serum 
tryptase .  
x Bone marrow biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]  (as clinically indicated according to site’s standard) .  
• At screening: bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (BMA) will be collected for FISH ( including , but may not be limited to, del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16)) and MRD analyses in central lab oratory . BMA or core biopsy (as clinically 
indicated) will be collected for disease assessment (local lab oratory ). Central laboratory samples will be collected for all patients but will be analyzed only for randomized patients . If local FISH  assessment is done 
using purified CD138+ plasma cells or  by [CONTACT_787661] , the most recent local FISH  report  will be collected in patients who fail central laboratory FISH testing, for central  review . Baseline MRD sample will be analyzed 
in patients who achiev e a CR.  
• During  study treatment: to confirm CR (local lab oratory ), and to assess MRD in case of CR (central lab oratory ). If the first  MRD  is positive , BMA collection for MRD is  to be repeated 3 months later for late 
negativity (one additional sample can be collected if patient remains MRD positive).  No more than [ADDRESS_1083573] treatment samples are to be obtained . 
y Blood sample for immune genetic determinants  (HLA and KIR genotype and Fc γgR polymorphism): To be performed within [ADDRESS_1083574] udy treatment administration on  Cycle  1 Day 1 (central lab).  
z Pharmacogenetics  (blood): Optional blood sample for pharmacogenetics  in both arms  in patients who signed the separate pharmacogenetics consent.  To be performed within [ADDRESS_1083575] ration on Cycle  1 Day 1 (central lab).  
aa Laboratory evaluation of  disease assessment  (local and central laboratory for each  planned  time point): At screening, all lab assessments to be performed within [ADDRESS_1083576] be available before the patient  may be randomized. In the absence of central lab results, sites may use local 
laboratory results for eligibility. Central labor atory results may not be available due to (but not limited to) the following reasons: samples were not able to be analyzed by  [CONTACT_35970] (for various reasons) . 
All lab assessments to be performed again prior to (within 24 hours) first study treatment administration  on Cycle 1 Day 1  and response evaluation will be calculated compared to Cycle 1 Day 1 assessments . In 
IPd arm only, an additional blood  sample will be collected at all time -points to evaluate the potential interference of isatuximab with the M protein assessment  (central laboratory) . 
Response will be  assessed on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings on Day1 of every cycle, to confirm response and whenever disease pr ogression is suspected . Investigator decision to continue study 
treatment or not will be taken  based  on local lab oratory results  except in selected country(ies) where central laboratory results are available on an ongoing basis (in which case, one sample  will be collected at each 
timepoint ). Efficacy analyses will be done according to IRC assessment, which will use central laboratory data.  
• Serum M -Protein immunoelectrophoresis  (SPEP)  and immunofixation: To be performed at screening  and again  prior to (within 24 hours) first study treatment ad ministration  on Cycle 1 Day 1 , then at 
Day 1 of every subsequent cycle  within 24 hours  prior to  study treatment administration , and at the EOT visit.  After C1D1 immunofixation to be done if SPEP is negative . 
• Urine M -Protein (24 -hour urine)  immunoelectrophoresis ( UPEP ) and immunofixation : To be performed at screening, sampling collection must  be completed  within 24 hours  prior to  study treatment 
administration  on Cycle 1 Day 1 , then within 24 hours prior to study treatment administration on Day 1 of every subsequent cycle  and at the EOT visit. If urine M -protein is negative (negative immunofixation) 
at screening  and Cycle 1 Day 1, this assessment is to be repeated every 3 cycles only (Cycle 4, Cycle 7, Cycle 10, etc) and to confirm CR . After C ycle 1 Day 1, i mmunofixation to be done if UPEP is 
negative in patients whose disease is evaluable in urine . 
• Serum free li ght chains (sFLC, quantification and ratio): To be performed at screening, within 24 hours prior to study treatment administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 , then within 24 hours prior to study treatment 
administration on  Day 1 of every subsequent cycle , and at the EOT visit (central lab analysis to be triggered if M protein is undetectable and immunofixation negative  after Cycle  1 Day 1). 
• Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE): To be performed at screening, within 24 hours prior to study treatment  administration on  Cycle 1 Day 1 and  within 24 hours prior to study treatment 
administration on Day 1 of every subsequent cycle , and at the EOT visit  (IgD or IgE only if the heavy chain component of the disease is known to be IgE or IgD). 
For patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression  serum M -protei n, urine M -protein  (plus or minus sFLCs if needed to confirm sCR) to be performed monthly  (central and 
local laboratory)  during the follow -up period until progression.  
bb Radiological assessment : All imaging to be sent for central review. Note: for bone lesion assessment or extramedullary disease, the same modality (ske letal survey or low -dose whole -body CT; CT or MRI) 
should be used throughout the study for each individual patient.  
Bone disease assessment:  Skeletal survey (including skull, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], all long bones, pelvis and chest) or low -dose whole -body CT scan at baseline (within 21 days prior to randomization), then once a year and 
anytime during the study if clinically ind icated.

dd AE/SAE assessment : All AEs, including AEs of new onset as well as worsening of baseline signs and symptoms are to be reported from the signing of the informed consen t to [ADDRESS_1083577] 
administration of study treatment. When diagnosis can be done, only main diagnosis (without its sig ns and symptoms) will be recorded as AE. After the 30  day follow -up all ongoing related AEs, all ongoing SAEs 
whatever relationship with study treatment, and all new related AEs whatever seriousness, are to be reported and followed up until resolution or s tabilization. Severity will be graded according to NCI -CTC v4.03.  
ee Prior medication s (which are not prior anti-myeloma therapy ) administered within  [ADDRESS_1083578] 60 -Day Follow -up (Day 60 visit, Day 90 visit, then every 3 months) . 
At 60 days (±5 days) after last treatment administration, the following are to be recorded for all patients: ECOG performance statu s, ePROs, pregnancy test (for F CBP), ADA, AE assessment , further anti -
myeloma therapy, survival status , and second primary malignancies.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment without PD  will be followed monthly  (ie, Day 60, Day 90 then every month thereafter)  until confirmation of PD (even for patients who would initiate further 
anti-myeloma therapy) . In addition to the above, the following will also be recorded  at all monthly visits : disease assessment labs, bone disease assessment,  radiological assessment every 12 weeks (±1 week) in 
case of known or documented extramedullary disease (plasmacytoma) at b aseline, and skeletal survey (to be assessed yearly or if clinically indicated) .  
At 90 days (±5 days) after last treatment administration , and every 3 months thereafter until death, the following are to be recorded for patients with PD : AE assessment,  further anti -myeloma therapy, survival 
status and second primary malignancies.  
Every effort will be made to follow all patients. If survival follow -up is missed and is not obtained at the time of the scheduled interval, it should be retrieved immediately. For subsequent survival follow -up, the 
patient  FU visit  should be scheduled  at the original scheduled survival follow -up interval.  If the patient is unable to visit the clinical center, the follow -up may be done via phone from the Investigator or designee to  
the patient or the patient's caregiver or a family member , but this should be exception and all effort s should be made  to schedule follow -up visit at clinical center .

4.1 INTRODUCTION   
CD38 is a Type  II glycosylated 45 kilodalton (kDa ) membrane p rotein that was identified as 
a lymphocyte marker ( 2). CD38 has a role in leukocyte homeostasis through modulation of 
hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation ( 3). CD38 functions as a receptor binding to CD31 
and is involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The function of CD38 in signal 
transduction appears to be versatile depending on the cell lineage, the d ifferentiation stage, and, 
possibly, the association with different co -receptors ( 3). CD38 is also an ecto -enzyme catalyzing 
the synthesis an d hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine -diphosphate -ribose (cADPR ) from nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) to ADP -ribose (4). These reaction products are implicated in 
calcium mobilization and intracellular signaling  (5). 
The expression of CD38 in healthy humans can be detected on  natural killer (NK) cells, 
monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, granulocytes, activated T and B  cells, and plasma cells. 
In contrast, expression has not been detected in hematopoietic stem cells  (HSC) , resting T and 
B cells, or tissue macrophages. Several hematological malignancies express CD38 including those 
of B-lymphocyte, T -lymphocyte and myeloid origin. Mor eover, CD38 was identified as 
a negative prognostic marker in some hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymph ocytic 
leukemia (CLL ). The expression of CD38 is especially notable in multiple myeloma (MM ) as 
>98% of patients are positive for this protein (6, 7). The strong and uniform expression of CD38 
on malignant clonal MM cells contrasts with the restricted expression pattern on normal cells 
suggesting this antigen may be useful for specific targeting of tumor cells.   
4.2 MULTIPLE MYELOMA   
Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disease that is characterized by [CONTACT_787663] (BM ) and the produ ction of excessive amou nts of 
a monoclonal immunoglobulin (usually of the IgG or IgA type or free urinary light chain 
[paraprotein, M -protein or M -component]). It is a disease predominantly associated with 
advancing age with more than 80% of patients aged 60  years or older. Pati ents with MM can 
experience bone pain, bone fractures, fatigue, anemia, infections, hypercalcemia, and kidney 
problems ( 8). The disease cours e for MM varies with the aggressiveness of the disease and related 
prognostic factors. Certain chromosomal abnormalities in multiple myeloma have been shown to 
be associated with poor clinical outcome. High -risk cytogenetic changes include del(17p), t(4;14 ), 
and t(14;16), among others. During the [ADDRESS_1083595] decades, m edian survival has been improved from 
3 to 6 years; however, some patients can live longer than 10  years ( 8, 9). 
Treatment options and survival are based on the patient’s age, fitness and disease status. Patients 
under the age of approximately 65, presenting with symptomatic active disease in good  physical 
health will generally receive initial therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). To 
achieve cytoreduction of the disease before collecting stem cells, induction chemotherapy is

EFC14335  - isatuximab  Version number: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 40 administered. Induction treatment regimens include alk ylating agents, dexamethasone alone, 
thalidomide plus dexamethasone, and vincristine, Adriamycin® (doxorubicin), and dexamethasone 
(VAD; or modifications to this regimen); however, the lat ter 2 regimens are associated with 
higher toxicity (10). Newer treatments with Velcade® (bortezomib) alone, bortezomib 
combinations, and Revlimid® (lenalidomide) plus dexamethasone have demonstrated improved 
outcomes as induction therapy, and these agents demonstrate higher response rates and lower 
toxicity ( 9, 10). In addition to these new treatments, daratumumab has been recently approved in 
US and Europe  in single agent  based on response rate  of 29.2% (95%CI: 20.8 -38.9) in late stage 
relapse and refractory multiple myeloma patients previously treated with IMiDs and PI, 
supporting the use of CD38 antibody in MM  (11). 
The current aim of MM therapy is to control the disease as effectively as possible, to maximize 
quality of life and to prolong survival. Treatments for relapsed and/or refractory disease are often 
referred to as salvage therapy. The initial chemotherapy regimen ( eg, bortezomib plus 
dexamethasone or bortezomib thalidomide plus dexamethasone or lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone, or bortezomib plus melphalan p lus prednisone depending if the patient was 
eligible for stem cell transplantation or not) can be reinstituted for relapsed/refractory disease if 
the disease relapsed more than [ADDRESS_1083596] therapy ended. Subsequent treatment 
decisions are based  on whether the patient experiences an indolent or aggressive relapse. In 
general, MM patients will receive an average of 4 to 8  different regimens during their lifespan 
utilizing agents such as proteasome inhibitors ( eg, bortezomib, ixazomib and carfilzom ib) and 
immune modulatory agents ( eg, lenalidomide), monoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab), histone 
deacetylase (HDAC ) inhibitors (panobinostat) alone or in combination. However, once a patient 
becomes ref ractory to those agents, survival is limited and newer treatment options are needed to 
treat patients after they have failed stem cell transplant (SCT ), chemotherapy, proteasome 
inhibitors, and immunomo dulatory drugs (IMiDs®). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_787617], MM remains an incurable disease.  Thus, the treatment of patients 
who have received at least 2 different lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an 
immunomodulatory agent or who are double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD® 
remains an unmet medical need.

have demonstrated disease progression on or wi thin [ADDRESS_1083598] therapy.  
Pomalidomide is an IMiD with multiple cellular effects that inhibit MM cell growth and survival 
blocking the stromal support from the BM microenvironment that can promote myeloma cell 
growth; in addition, pom alidomide has potent immunomodulatory effects that enhance the 
immune response to myeloma cells by [CONTACT_787664] 
T cells (5). Pomalidomide has been approved following the data reported in the MM -[ADDRESS_1083599] common Grade 3 -4 hematological adverse events in the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Single agent   
The TED10893 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) trial is a Phase  I/II single ag ent trial of isatuximab in RRMM . In 
the Phase  II dose finding part of the trial patients with RRMM (≥3  lines of anti -MM therapy or 
refractory to IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors [PIs ]) were randomized to isatuximab  3 mg/kg 
Q2W, 10  mg/kg Q2W x 2 cycles then Q4W, or 10  mg/kg Q2W, furthermore a fourth treatment 
arm was enrolled at 20  mg/kg QW/Q2W. As of November  2015, the observed ORR was: 9% 
(2/23), 20% (5/25), 29% (7/24) and 24% (6/25) at isatuximab ISA 3 Q2W, 10  Q2W/Q4W, 
10 Q2W, and 20  mg/kg QW/Q2W, respectively; 14/[ADDRESS_1083603] common adverse events (AEs ) were nausea (33%), fatigue (30%), dyspnea (26%), and 
cough (24%), which were typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539]  ≤2. Infusion  associated reactions (IARs) occurred in 
49% of patients, mostly Grade  ≤2, 94% during the first infusion. Six patients discontinued therapy 
due to AEs, 2 due to IARs.

[IP_ADDRESS].2  Pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone   
The combination of isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is being studied in the 
ongoing TCD14079 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This is a Phase  1b dose escalation trial evaluati ng the 
combination in patients with refractory or relapsed and ref ractory multiple myeloma. 
Three  isatuximab dose levels are planned to be evaluated, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks 
followed by [CONTACT_787667] (QW/Q2W). Pomalidomide is admi nistered at 4 mg per day for 
21 days and dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg if ≥75 years old) once a week as per the current label 
of pomalidomide, cycles are 28 -day each.  
As of May 26th 2016, 18 patients were enrolled in the trial; all of them have received at least 
[ADDRESS_1083607] therapy. Eight patients were treated at 5 mg/kg and 6 at 
10 mg/kg. Four patients have been enrolled at 20 mg/kg dose level although the data is not 
presented here as these is not mature enough for the first hint of efficacy (none of them have 
completed at least 2  cycles of treatment).  
Among the 14 patients for whom the data is available, 8 were treated at the dose of 5 mg/kg (with 
a median exposure of 21.2 weeks); and 6 patients at the dose of 10 mg/kg QW, then Q2W (with a 
median exposure of 8.1 weeks). Three patients discontinued tr eatment, 2 because of PD, and 
1 because of a reason classified as “other” (patient wish due to grade 2 i nfusion associated 
reaction). The most common TEAEs reported in more than 3 patients consisted of fatigue (all 
Grade 64.3%, Grade 3 -4 in 1 patient, 7.1%), infusion related reac tion (all Grade 57.1%, no 
Grade  3-4), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], tremor,  dyspnea, and cough (all Grade 28.6%, no 
Grade 3 -4). Infections occurred in 6 patients (42.9%) with a severity of Grade 3 -4 in 1 patient

4.5 RATIONALE   
4.5.1  Study r ationale   
Multiple myeloma  is a high unmet medical need and as a result, several agents are currently under 
clinical investigation in MM. Some of them (including isatuximab ) have shown clinical activity as 
monotherapy, but the clinical avenue f or development of most of them is to search for rationally 
based or pre -clinically oriented combinations of these novel agents with standard of care of MM, 
looking for poten tiation. Monoclonal antibodies  are one of the most promising groups of drugs in 
development in the treatment of MM with several of them demonstrating activity in this disease 
(13). One of the most important characteristics of this type of agents, apart from the clinical 
efficacy demonstrated, is the safety profile and the absence of potential cross -resistance with the 
agents cu rrently utilized. This mak es mAb an ideal combination partner with proteasome 
inhibitors, IMiDs and steroids.

(EFC14335 ) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of isatuximab in combination with 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone  compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone . 
4.5.[ADDRESS_1083614] between 3 mg/kg and 10  mg/kg 
and above.  
Although no evident difference is seen for tolerability, the available data in combination with 
lenalidomide (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ) does not demonstrate major differences in efficacy between 
10 and 20 mg/kg w ith comparable response rate in heavily pretreated patients. There is no 
apparent increase on adverse events with the combination and no DDI was evidenced between 
isatuximab and lenalid omide. PK/PD y analyses including trial simulations and simulations of 
serum M protein -profiles showed higher predicted ORR and reduction in M -protein at 8/12 weeks 
at doses ≥10 mg/kg. However, the benefit in term s of ORR increase or in term serum M -protein 
reduction appeared limited when increasing the dose fr om 10 to 20 mg/k g QW x 4, Q2W. 
Therefore, based on clinical efficacy, safety, PK simulations and PK/PD y analyses, the dose 
selected for further lenalidomide/isatuximab combi nation studies is 10  mg/kg  QW 
x 4 administrations followed by 10 mg/kg Q2W.  
The data available for  the combination of isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in 
the TCD14079 shows no apparent difference in efficacy and tolerability between the two doses 
currently studied  (5 and 10  mg/kg). Isatuximab  PK appeared not to  be altered by  [CONTACT_787668] -versa, as it has been shown for isatuximab in combination with lenalidomide. It is not 
expected to have an increase on response rate with 20 mg/kg as this was not seen in single agent 
or in combination with lenalidomide, although no data is available yet as the cohort is under 
enrolment.   
In addition, the change in the formulation (P2F2 v ersus P1F2) appears not to modify the PK of 
isatuximab and therefore would not require a dose adjustment based on PK/PD y relationships.    
The current  data show:  
• The single agent data coming from  the TED14054 (P2F2) and TED10893 (P1F1) where 
there is no apparent differ ence between the 2 formulation,  
• No effect of pomalidomide or lenalidomide  on isatuximab PK parameters and vice versa ,

there is no benefit in response rate with increasing the dose from 10 to 20 mg/kg . 
Based on these data above, the dose of isatuximab 10 mg/kg was selected for the combination 
with pomalidomide  and dexamethasone in this Phase 3  trial. 
4.5.3  Benefit/Risk of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and low -dose 
dexamethasone   
Based on the safety and efficacy data described a bove, isatuximab as a single agent has shown 
clinical benefit in response rate with a favorable safety profile. Infusion -associated reactions are 
manageable with mandatory prophylaxis, close monitoring, and supportive care.  
When isatuximab is combined wit h lenalidomide  and low -dose dexamethasone  or pomalidomide  
and low -dose dexamethasone , results appear promising. The overall safety profile of isatuximab 
in combination with lenalidomide does not appear to add morbidity to the clinical course of 
patients wi th RRMM, and is comparable with AEs observed with other established regimens.  In 
the ongoing Phase  1b study TCD14079 (isatuximab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone), d espi[INVESTIGATOR_787620] G rade 3 to 4 neutropenia ( 85.7%) reported a s a laboratory abnormalit y 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), no increase in the incidence of febrile neutropenia or neutropenic infection 
has been observe d compared to the available data on the combination of pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone ( 15). 
Thus, the collective clinical experience shows a positive balance of benefit over risk and warrants 
further evaluation of the combination of isatuximab with pomalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone in RRMM as proposed in this clinical trial.  
4.5.4  Study design   
The study protocol has been  designed to demonstrate a progression free survival and an overall 
survival advantage of isatuximab at the dose of 10 mg/kg weekly during first month, f ollowed by

carfilzomib or ixa zomib) alone or in combination and have demonstrated disease progression on 
or within [ADDRESS_1083617] therapy.  
After confirmation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomly assigned using an IRT system 
in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms:  
• Isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide a nd low -dose dexamethasone 
(IPd,  experimental arm) , 
• Pomalidomide and low -dose dexamethasone (Pd, control arm).  
Isatuximab, pomalidom ide and dexamethasone are defined in this protocol as “study treatments”.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<75 years versus ≥75 years) and number of previous 
lines  of therapy  (2 or 3 versus more than 3). A complete transplant procedure (induction, 
mobilization, conditioning, transplant, consolidation and mainten ance) will be considered as 
one line. Each other regimen will be considered as one line, whatever the reason of 
discontinuation (progression, adverse event or patient request).  
Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable AEs or patient wish , 
whichever comes first . 
Study design is summarized in the graph below:

The duration of the study for a patient will include a period for screening of up to 21 days (or up 
to 28 days for F CBP) . A cycle duration is [ADDRESS_1083619] dose of study 
treatments for  assessments including ADA  (IPd arm only) . If the ADA test at Day 60 is  positive 
or inconclusive, ADA testing will be repeated every 30 days until negative ( IPd arm only).  If 
isatuximab is stopped prior to pomalidomide and dexamethasone, ADA will be tested on D ay [ADDRESS_1083620] at the second cycle adm inistered without isatuximab is positive 
or inconclusive, ADA testing will be repeated every cycle until negative.  
The related AEs and all SAE s regardless of relationship to study treatment ongoing at the time of 
study treatment discontinuation will be fo llowed during the follow -up period until resolution or 
stabilization. During the follow -up period, any new related adverse events (regardless of 
seriousness)  will be collected and followed until resolution or stabilization.  
During FU, patients who disconti nue study treatment due to progressive disease (PD) will be 
followed every 3 months (12 weeks) for further anti -myeloma therapy, second primary 
malignancies, and survival until death or final OS cut-off date, whichever comes first. Patients 
who discontinue the study treatment prior to documentation of PD will be followed -up monthly  
until confirmation of PD  (even for patients who would initiate further anti -myeloma therapy 
without  PD), and then every 3 months (12  weeks) for further anti -myeloma therapy, second 
primary malignancies, and survival, until death or final OS cut-off date, whichever comes first.  
If a patient is still on treatment at the time of the cut -off date for OS and is benefitting from th e 
study treatment, the patient can continue the study treatment until disease progression, 
unacceptable AEs, patient wish, or any other reason. For cycles completed after the cut -off date  
for OS , study treatment administration, pregnancy tests for F CBP, all related AEs , all serious AEs 
(regardless of relationship to study treatment ), laboratory abnormalities if applicable, and reason 
of end of treatment  (EOT)  will continue to be collected.  For patients in th e IPd arm, 1  ADA 
sample should be drawn 60  ±[ADDRESS_1083621] study treatment administration. If ADA is positive 
or inconclusive at 60 days, the repeat samples will be taken every 30  ±7 days until the results 
become negative (see Section  1.3). For patients still on treatment at the time of amended 
protocol  07, ADA sampl ing is no more required .

8.2.2  Premedication  (NIMP)  - Prevention of Infusion Associated Reactions (IARs)   
Patien ts allocated to IPd arm  should routinely receive pre medication prior to isatuximab  infusion 
to reduce the risk and severity of IAR s commonly observed with monoclonal antibodies. The 
recommended premedication agents are: diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg IV (or equivalent : 
eg, cetirizine,  promethazine, dexchlorpheniramine, according to local approval and availability. 
Intravenous  route is preferred for at least the  first 4 infusions ), dexamethasone IV/PO (dose 
defined below), ranitidine * 50 mg IV (or equivalent : other approved H2 antagonis ts 
[eg, cimetidine],  oral proton pump inhibitors [eg , omeprazole, esomeprazole] ) and acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) 650-1000 mg PO 15 to 30 minutes (but no longer than 60 minutes) prior to 
isatuximab  infusion . Once the premedication regimen is completed, the isatuximab infusion must 
start immediately . 
*NOTE: The use of ranitidine or equivalent to be part or not of premedication is left to the 
medical judgement . 
On the day of isatuximab  infusion, a total of 40 mg of dexamethasone (regular dose of 
dexamethasone when used in combination with pomalidomide ), or 20 mg in patient s ≥75years , 
will be administered as part of the premedication  and study  treatment  before isatuximab  and

[IP_ADDRESS]  General rul es  
Dose modifications are permitted according to the guidelines described in this section.  
Dose reduction for pomalidomide and low -dose dexamethasone and/or cycle delay  (ie, delay of all 
study treatments ) are permitted in case of toxicity. Patient may have dose omitted ( isatuximab  
and/or pomalidomide and/or dexamethasone) within a cycle if toxicity occur s and the patient does 
not recover by [CONTACT_787676]/administ ration. If a patient experiences several 
toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, the most conservative dose adjustment 
recommended (dose reduction/omission /delay  appropriate to the most severe toxicity) should be 
followed.  Once a dose  of poma lidomide or dexamethasone  has been decreased, intra -patient 
re-escalation back to the previous dose level is not permitted.  
Administration of the study treatment  (isatuximab  and/or  pomalidomide and /or dexamethasone) 
will be discontinued in the event of an AE that persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_787621], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], warrants discontinuation.  
All changes to study treatment administration must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Patient s will receive the next cycle of study treatment after recovery of the toxicity as described 
below.  
A new cycle of study treatment may begin on the scheduled Day  1 of a subsequent cycle if the 
following criteria are met.  
• ANC ≥1000 /mm3. 
• Platelet c ount ≥50 000/mm3. For patients with plasma cells ≥50% of bone marrow 
nucleated cells at baseline, to initiate Cycle 2, platelet counts should be ≥30 000/mm3 
regardless response status at end of Cycle 1. During  Cycles 2 -4, platelet counts should be 
≥30 000/mm3, if last res ponse is not better than SD, but if last response is PR or better 
during  Cycles 2-4, D1 next cycle can be administe red only if platelet counts ≥50  000/mm3. 
For D1 administration beyond  Cycle 4 , platelet counts should be ≥50  000/mm3. 
Any other pomalidomide,  dexamethasone or isatuximab  related AE that may have occurred in the 
previous cycle has recovered to ≤G1 or baseline severity (or according to the dose modification s 
shown in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
If these criteria are not met on the schedul ed Day  1, patients should be re -evaluated weekly. If 
these criteria are not met within 14 days of the scheduled Day  1 (planned D ay 1 Cycle n+1 
corresponds to D ay 29 Cycle n) , the patient should be discontinued from study treatment , unless 
there is strong e vidence of clinical benefit to justify continuation of dosing with study treatment,

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 63 If there are dose modifications within the previous cycle, these guidelines sh ould be followed for 
the initiation of a new cycle:  
• If pomalidomide dosing was halted during the previous cyc le and was restarted with 
a one-level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of the cycle, 
then that reduced dose level  will be initiated on Day  1 of the new cycle. Once a dose of 
pomalidomide or dexamethasone has been reduced, intra -patient re -escalation back to the 
previous dose level is not permitted.  
• Patients may have isatuximab dose omission within a cycle if toxicity  occurs and does not 
recover on the day of planned infusion or within the following 3 days.  Within a cycle, 
a delay of up to 3 days in cases of unresolved toxicity at the time of planned 
re-administration is permitted , otherwise infusion is omitted. Patien ts will receive the next 
isatuximab infusion after recovery of the toxicity as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  No dose 
reduction of isatuximab is permitted.  
If one of the study treatment s is prematurely permanently discontinued, then other drug (s) can be

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 72 8.2.4  Infusion reaction s  
Patients should routinely receive premedications prior to isatuximab infusion as detailed in 
Section  8.2.2  to reduce the risk and severity of IARs commonly observed with mAbs. Infusion 
associated reactions ( for example, NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 term s “infusion related reaction ”, 
“allergic re action ”, or “cytokine release syndrome ”) are defined as AEs related to isatuximab with 
onset typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 24  hours from the start of the infusion.  
Patients who experience Grade 2 IAR(s)  may resume isatuximab after recovery, at half of the 
initial infus ion rate under close monitoring and supportive care as needed. Additional medication 
can be provided for symptom treatment as per Investigator judgment including diphenhydramine 
25 mg IV (or equivalent) a nd methylprednisolone [ADDRESS_1083656] be completed 
within the time specified in the pharmacy manual . 
Further treatment (subsequent isatuximab infusions) with the fixed rate:   
• In case of Grade 2 IAR during the 2nd infusion, infusion could be restart  at half  of the 
initial infusion rate  (25 mL/hour) when the IAR improves to Grade ≤1 . If symptoms do not 
recur after 30 minutes, the infusion rate may be increased by 50  mL/hour  increm ents every 
30 minutes, until the total volume is infused to  maximum rate of 200 mL/hour . 
• In case of Grade [ADDRESS_1083657] infusion and subsequent, infusion could be restarted at 
one-half (100 mL/hour) of the infusion rate (100 mL/hour) when the IAR improves to 
Grade ≤1. If symptoms do not recur after 30 minutes, the infusion rate  may be increased  
by 50 mL/hour increments every 30 minutes, until the total volume is infused to maximum  
rate of 200 mL/hr.  
Patients with a Grade [ADDRESS_1083658] isatuximab permanently discontinued and 
appropriate supportive therapy should be administered. Should an isatuximab IAR of 
Grade  ≥2 occur, additional blood sampling during the AE is required for analysis of cytokine 
levels (TNFα, IL -1β, IL -6, IL -4 and IFNγ), markers of complement  activation  (C3a, C4 and

Appendix O  should be considered for IMP administration.  
8.3 TUMOR LYSIS  SYNDROME MANAGEMENT   
Management of tumor lysis syndrome is detailed in Section  10.6.2 . 
8.4 BLINDING PROCEDURES   
During the trial, administration of isatuximab is to be open -label, and no attempt will be m ade to 
blind administration.  
A centralized randomization system (IRT) will be used to prevent the investigators from knowing 
in advance the treatment assignment, as the randomization is the best method to avoid bias.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_197593] -label administration o f isatuximab , assessment of outcomes will be based on 
objectively collected data, which are radiological and laboratory assessments for tumor response 
by [CONTACT_787684].   
Blinding rules for the Sponsor  study team will be detailed in a separate document.  
8.5 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMEN T GROUP   
All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (either IPd arm or Pd arm) in 
a 1:[ADDRESS_1083660] according to age (<75 versus ≥75) and number of previous lines ( 2 or 
3 versus more than 3). 
After each patient has completed the nece ssary screening visit procedures, the corresponding 
baseline eCRFs have been completed and the patient is deemed e ligible for study entry by [CONTACT_787685]  (or local, only if central results are not 
available) evaluations  (serum or urine M -protein) , the study site will contact [CONTACT_6606]. The site will 
enter the following information regarding the clinical site and study patient:

Prophylactic administration of G -CSF in a patient who is experiencing recurrent difficulties with 
neutropenia, or therapeuti c use in patients with serious neutropenic complications (such as tissue 
infection, sepsis syndrome or fungal infection) may be considered at the investigator’s discretion, 
consistent with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)  guidelines (2006) during the first 
3 treatment cycles in order to decrease the risk of neutropenia specially in patients with baseline 
extensive bone marrow involvement and/or low neutrophil count ( 16). 
8.9.3  Prohibited concomitant therapy   
• Concurrent treatment with any other anti-myeloma  therapy not specified in the protocol, 
including immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy or biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or 
other investigational drug , or curative radiotherapy . However, palliative radiotherapy may 
be given to control pain.  The irradiated area should be as small as possible and should 
never involve more than 20% of  the bone marrow in any given 3 -week period. In all such 
cases, the possibility of tumor progression should be ruled out by [CONTACT_106625], biochemical 
and radiological assessments of the tumor. The irra diated area cannot be used as 
a parameter for response assessment . 
• Concomitant  systemic corticosteroids, other than as part of the protocol -specified 
therapeutic regimen or for treatment of hypersensitivity reaction, are prohibited.  
Additional glucocorticoids  (or inhaled glucocorticosteroids whenever indicated) , 
antihistamines, and analgesics, for the management of IARs are permitted.  
• Live vaccines should be avoided. However, giv en the increased risk of infection, routine  
vaccinations are recommended for the patients and their contacts. Prophylactic vaccination 
is recommended for influenza A and B virus, pneumococci and haemophilus influenza.  
• Avoid co -administration of strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 : 
- Cinafloxacin

recommendations  (Appendix L ) or the country specific risk management plan in countries where 
pomalidomide is not supplied by [CONTACT_1034] .  
Criteria for Females  of Childbearing Potential  
This protocol defines a FCBP  as a sexually mature female  who:  
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months).  
The inv estigator must ensure that:  
• Females  of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding . 
• Females  NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that they understand the hazards and 
necessary precautions associated with the use of pomalidomide . 
• Male patients taking pomalidomide acknowledge that they understand that traces of 
pomalidomide have been found in semen, that they understand the potential teratogenic 
risk if engaged in sexual activity with a FCBP  or pregnant female , and that they 
understand the need for the use of a condom even if they have had a vasectomy.    
Contraception  
Females  of childbearing potential enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable forms of 
contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse 
during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at lea st 28 days before starting 
pomalidomide ; 2) throughout the entire duration of pomalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_1083665] include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. A FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:   
• Highly effective methods:  
- Intrauterine device (IUD)

- Tubal ligation  
- Partner’s vasectomy  
• Additional effective methods:  
- Male condom  
- Diaphragm  
- Cervical Cap  
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma 
taking pomalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_64807]. If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should 
switch to one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism 
continues for 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of 
contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co -treatment with dexamet hasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be 
considered particularly in patients with neutr openia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for FCBP , including FCBP  who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  
Before starting pomalidomide  
Female Patients:  
Females  of childbearing potential must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 
25 mIU/mL) prior to prescribing pomalidomide . The first pregnancy test must be performed 
within [ADDRESS_1083666] be 
performed within 24 hours prior pomalidomide  administration . The patient may not receive 
pomalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are 
negative.  
Male Patients:  
Must agre e to practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_787692], during dose 
interruptions and for at least 3 or 5 months  following study treatment  discontinuation  for Pd and

documentation of PD (as determined by [CONTACT_26732]) or the date of death from any cause, whichever 
comes first.  
The following disease as sessment procedures will be performed at screening (for eligibility) and 
again  prior to (within 24 hours) the start of study treatment administration at Cycle 1 Day 1 
(baseline for response assessment) and then Day  1 of every cycle during treatment up to 
progression and for patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progression, 
every 4 weeks during follow -up until PD:  
• M-protein quantification (serum and 24 -hour urine, protein immunoelectrophoresis and 
immunofixation) ( local and central  laboratory) . After C1D1, immunofixation will be done 
in case of undetectable M protein (serum and urine)  
• Free light chains quantification ( local and central laboratory).  
• Quantitative immunoglobulins ( local and central laboratory)  
• Other examinations for disease assessment will be done as below:  
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (or biopsy as clinically indicated) at baseline, and then to confirm 
response (local laboratory, and in case of CR central laboratory will be done to assess 
MRD)  
• Bone disease assessment:  
- Skeletal survey (including skull, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], all long bones, pelvis and chest) or low -dose 
whole -body CT scan at baseline, then once a year and anytime during the study if 
clinically indicated.  
• Extramedullary disease (plasmacytoma) assessment (including bone plasm acytoma):  
- If known or documented extramedullary disease  (plasmacytoma)  at baseline, CT scan 
or MRI is to be done at baseline and to be repeated every 12 weeks  (±1 week) , and if 
clinically indicated.  
- CT scan or MRI t o be done in case of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_787630] a patient with no previous positive image for extramedullary disease

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 84 Efficacy assessments leading to treatment continuation will be performed according to local 
laboratory results and based on the Investigator assessment. Efficacy asses sments for the primary 
and secondary endpoint s will be performed on the basis of central laboratory findings on D ay 1 of 
every cycle . Response/progression wi ll be determined according to I MWG criteria ( Appendix D ). 
Response/p rogression based on paraprotein will be confirmed based on 2 consecutive 
assessments. A blinded IRC will evaluate disease assessments at each cycle and determine the 
progression and response status of each patient per IMWG (Appendix D ) and  as described in the 
IRC Charter. Further details on the handling of missing disease assessments and  the IRC process 
for determining the date of disease progression and overall objective response are described in the 
IRC Char ter and/or the statistical analysis plan . 
Progressive disease (IMWG criteria) is defined for patients with measurable serum and/or urine 
M protein as any one of the following:  
• Increase of ≥25% in Serum M -component  from nadir  (the absolute increase must be 
≥0.5 g/dL)  in 2 consecutive assessments ; serum M component increases ≥1 g/dL in 
2 consecutive assessments are sufficient to define relapse if starting  M component is 
≥5 g/dL and/or,  
• Increase of ≥25% in Urine M -component from nadir (the absolute increase mu st be 
≥200 mg/24 h)  in 2 consecutive assessments and/or ,  
• Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue extramedullary disease or increase 
≥50% from nadir in the sum of perpendicular diameters of existing soft tissue 
extramedullary disease  lesion s if >1  lesion or ≥50% increa se in the longest diameter of 
a previous soft tissue extramedullary disease  lesion >1  cm in short axis , 
• Clinical deterioration will not be considered progression in the primary analysis of PFS 
and progression cannot be diagnosed on FLC progression only.  
Patient s with only FLC measurable disease are not allowed in the protocol.  
In case of  both serum and urine M protein becomes below level of eligibility on efficacy 
laboratory performed on Cycle  1 Day 1, please refer to Appendix D  for assessment of progression 
and overall response . 
9.2 KEY SECONDARY EFFICA CY ENDPOINTS   
Two key secondary efficacy endpoints are considered:  
• Overall Response Rate (ORR), as per IMWG criteria . 
• Overall Survival (OS).  
Overall response rate ( ORR ): is defined as the proportion of patients with stringent complete 
response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial 
response (PR) , as assessed by [CONTACT_787694].  
Overall survival ( OS): is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death 
from any cause.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated as follows : 
Time to Progression  (TTP) : is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
first documentation of PD (as determined by [CONTACT_55543]). The same definition of progression as for the 
PFS endpoint will be used . 
PFS in the high risk cytogenetic population:  is defined as PFS as defined in Section  9.1 in the 
subgroup of patients carrying high risk cytogenetic changes including del(17p), t(4;14) or  t(14;16)  
assessed by [CONTACT_4656] .  
Duration of response  (DOR) : is defined as the time from the date of the first IRC determined 
response to the date of first IRC PD or death, whichever happens first. D uration of response  is 
determined only for patients who have achieved a response of ≥PR.  
9.3.2  Safety endpoints   
Safety in terms of treatment -emergent adverse events/serious adverse events (TEAE/SAE), 
laboratory parameters, vital signs  (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) , weight, ECOG 
performance status, and physical ex amination  will be assessed  through out the study and will be 
reported in the eCRF . 
Adverse event data will be collected by [CONTACT_787695] . 
TEAEs are defined as AEs that develop, worsen (according to the Investigator op inion), or 
become serious during the TEAE period. The TEAE period is defined as the time from first dose 
of study treatments up to [ADDRESS_1083669] dose of study treatments. Adverse events and 
laboratory parameters wil l be graded using NCI -CTC v4.03 ( Appendix C ). 
Specific safety laboratory tests are planned in case of infusion reaction (see study flow chart i n 
Section  1.2 and Section  10.6.1 ). 
Full details of safety reporting and adverse event monitoring procedures are provided in 
Section  10.4 and Section  10.7.

EFC14335  - isatuximab  Version number: [ADDRESS_1083670] been designed for self -completion.  
Cycle 1 Day 1 (prior to study treatment administration) will serve as the baseline assessment for 
all patients. All the electronic patient -reported outcomes (ePROs ) are to be completed by [CONTACT_787696] , before other clinician assessments are conducted, 
and before his/her clinical condition, treatment plan, AEs, etc  are discussed . The latter is  to ensure 
the objectivity of the patient responses  free from their emotional reactions to prevent bias.  The 
patient is to complete ePRO questionnaire s on his or her own.  
There will be a minimum of 20 minutes  time allocated  to train patients on eP RO techn ology at 
Cycle 1 Day 1 vi sit. Training assistance will be provided for sub sequent cycles, EOT, and 
follow -up if the patient requests a refresher.  
While on treatment, ePROs are to be administered prior to treatment on Day 1 of every cycle, at 
the EOT visit  and at 60 (±5 days) days after last study treatment  administration . The time 
estimated to complete the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the EORTC QLQ -MY20 is approximately  
10-15 minutes. The time estimated to complete the EQ -5D-5L is approximately 5  to 10 minutes.  
In order to optimize compliance of the patient, and to ensure the completeness of the ePRO data , 
it is recommended  that a key person (eg, research nurse) is assigned and responsible at each  center  
for ePRO data collection . 
A statistical analysis plan for the three ePROs will be detailed in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EORTC QLQ -C30  
The EORTC QL Q-C30 is a cancer -specific instrument that contains 30 items and provides a 
multi -dimensional assessment of HRQ L (17, 18, 19). The validity and reliability of the EORTC 
QLQ -C30 has been established in various types of cancers ( 20). 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 provides a comprehensive assessment of the principal HRQL dimensions 
identified as relevant by [CONTACT_787697] s (physical functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive 
functioning, role functioning, social functioning, global HRQL, impact of symptoms and of 
toxicities). EORTC QLQ -C30 is one of the standard instruments used in oncology for the 
evaluation of new cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The QLQ -C30 is composed of both multi -item scales and single -item measures. These include 
five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), three symptom 
scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), a Global Health Status (GHS) /quality of life scale, 
and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial 
difficulties). All of the scales and single -item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher 
score for a functional scale/GHS represents a higher/healthy lev el of fun ctioning/HRQL, where 
a higher score for symptoms /items represents a higher level of symptomatology/problems. The 
recall period for this instrument is 1 week.

The E ORTC QLC -MY20 will be administered  in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ -C30 to 
assess disease - and treatment -specific symptoms and side effects in patients with multiple 
myeloma ( 21, 22). 
The MY20 contains 20 items, 4 independent subscales covering 2 functional domains (Future 
Perspective and Body Image) and 2 symptom scales (Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of 
Treatment). Higher scores for Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment in dicate more 
symptoms and side effects and lower HRQL , whereas a high score for Future Perspective and 
Body Image represents better outcomes.  
These are reliable and valid measures of HRQL in cancer patients and the two instruments 
together (50 items) take a pproximately [ADDRESS_1083671]

[IP_ADDRESS]  EQ-5D-5L  
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status  that provides a general assessment  of 
health and wellbeing. For this study, the updated 2011 version will be used.  
The instrument is composed of a descriptive section that includes the 5 dimensions and a VAS . 
The EQ -5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has a 5-level  response : no problems, 
slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extrem e problems. The EQ VAS 
records  the respondent’s self -rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with 
endpoints labelled ‘the best health you can imagine’ and ‘the worst health you can imagine’. This 
information provides  a quantitative measure of health as judged by [CONTACT_112775].  
Response options are measured with a 5 -point Likert scale (for the 5L version ). Global scores are 
available while higher scores indicate better HRQL .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics parameters   
Blood concentrations of isatuximab will be used for population PK analysis by [CONTACT_105] -linear mixed 
effects modeling. Additional details of the analysis plan and the results will be provided in a 
separate document. This analysis will involve an estimation of inter -patient PK variability, the 
population pharmacokinetic parameters estimates and the assessments of pathophysiologic 
covariate effects on CL and possibly on volume if warrant ed. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_787631] (AUCs) will also be performed. The PK 
estimates will then be investigated as prognostic factors for clinical outcome including safety and 
efficacy endpoints, if possible.  
9.3.5  Immunogenicity   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti-drug antibodies   
Human anti -drug antibodies  (ADA)  to isatuximab  will be assessed throughout the study for the 
IPd arm only. Blood samples will be collected for ADA detection according to the Flow Charts 
(see Section  1.2 and Section  1.3). The sampling times for ADA detection can be modified based 
on the upd ated knowledge of isatuximab on immunogenicity.  
A sample will be considered as ADA positive if ADA is detected ie , sample generates an assay 
signal equal to or greater than the cut -point in the screening assay and is tested positive in the 
confirmatory as say.

isatuximab is positive or inconclusive, ADA testing will be repeated every cycle until ne gative.  
Pre-existing ADA is defined as ADA that were present in samples drawn during the pretreatment 
period (ie, before the first isatuximab administration). Treatment -induced ADA is defined as ADA 
that developed at any time during the ADA on -study observ ation period in patients without pre -
existing ADA, including patients without pretreatment samples. Treatment boosted ADA is 
defined as preexisting ADA with an increase in titer during ADA on -study observation period.  
Transient ADA response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at one sampling time point during the treatment or 
follow -up observation period (excluding the last sampling time point, which ought to be 
considered persistent unless shown to be undetectable at a later time) or ,  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the first and last ADA -positive 
samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period less 
than 16 weeks, and the  patient ’s last sampling time point is ADA -negative.  
Persistent ADA response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the first and last ADA -positive 
samples (irre spective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period of 
16 weeks or longer or ,

9.4.1  Pharmacogenetic assessment   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Optional stored DNA sample   
For those patients (in both arms) who sign the optional pharmacog enetic informed consent form  
(ICF ), a blood sample will be collected at Cycle 1 Day 1 and DNA extracted from this blood will 
be stored.  
This sample may be used to determine a possible relationship between genes and response to 
treatment with isatuximab , how the body processes isatuximab , and possible side effects to 
isatuximab . Genes that may be studied include those for the immune system.  
This blood sample will be transferred to a site (managed by [CONTACT_55412]) that will extract DNA from 
the sample.  
This blood sample, and the DNA that is extracted from it, will  be assigned a second number, 
a genetic ID (de -identification code) that is different  from the patient  ID. This “double coding” is 
performed to separate a patient ’s medical information and DNA data.  
The clinical study data (coded by [CONTACT_787698]) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environment from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by [CONTACT_787699]). The key linking patient  ID and 
genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control. The matching of 
clinical data and pharmacogen etic data, for the purpose of data analysis, will be possible only by 
[CONTACT_181278], which will be under strict access control. All data will be reported only in coded 
form in order to maintain confidentiality.  
The DNA will be stored for up to 15 years fr om the completi on of the clinical study report.  
9.4.2  Exploratory biomarker analysis   
A blood sample will be collected at Cycle 1  Day 1 . Leukocyte DNA will be extracted and 
analyzed for  immune genetic determinants (such as FcγR polymorphisms, HLA and KIR 
genotypes) and correlated with parameters of clinical response. This  germline genetic analysis is 
a mandatory part of the protocol and will not be performed under separate pharmacogeneti c 
consent.  
In the IPd arm only, a n additional blood sample will be collected to evaluate the potential 
interference  of isatuximab  with the M protein assessment in immunoelectrophoresis and 
immunofixation assays. This additional sample will be collected at all time -points that central M 
protein analysis is performed and analyzed by a central laboratory.

MM. 
These other research analyses will help to understand either disease subtypes or drug response, or 
to develop and/or validate a bioassay method, or to identify new drug targets or biomarkers.  
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers used during the study 
(ie, patient  ID). They will be transferred to a [COMPANY_011] site (or a subcontractor site) which can be 
located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards 
for protecting patien t confidentiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and Section  14.5). These

distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of 
consent for no n-patient contact [CONTACT_6492] -up, eg, medical records check. Patients requesting 
withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow -up may jeopardize 
the public health value of the study. The Investigator  should make every effort to 
re-contact [CONTACT_102], to identify the reason why he/she decided to withdraw, and to 
determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status.

A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, or  
• Is life -threatening, or  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event  
Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787639] ( ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition s are to be considered a medically important event s. The list is 
not intended to be exhaustive:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias ( ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow apl asia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc). 
• Development of drug dependence or drug abuse . 
• Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality . 
• Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if docume nted as a consequence of blood 
sampling) . 
• Bullous cutaneous eruptions .

each cycle) with the study treatment, even not fulfilling a seriousn ess criterion, is to be reported to 
the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours) using the AE form together with the SAE 
complementary form to be entered in the eCRF . 
10.4.2  General guidelines for reporting adverse events   
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment , spanning from the signature 
[CONTACT_458187] ([ADDRESS_1083699] dose of study treatment), are to be 
recorded on the correspon ding page(s) or screen(s) of the eCRF for included patients. For screen 
failed patients, recording in the eCRF is only performed in case of SAE occurring during the 
screening period or in case of AE when some screening procedures expose the patient to safe ty 
risks ( eg, any substance administered as premedication, invasive tests performed or chronic 
treatment interrupted).  
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset , intensity, action taken with respect to study 
treatment , corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome and 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_169185] . 
All study treatment -related AEs and all SAEs (regardless of their causal relationship to study 
treatment) ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation need to be followed until 
resolution or stabilization. Any AE or SAE assessed as study treatment -related that are new 
during the follow -up period are to be reported and followed until resolution or stabilization.  
When treatment is discontinued, observations will continue for that patient as defined by [CONTACT_12695].  
Vital signs or ECG abnormalities a re to be recorded as AEs only if they are symptomatic and/or 
requir e corrective treatment and/or lead to treatment discontinuation and/or modification of 
dosing and/or fulfilling a serious criterion and/or are defined as an AESI.  
Laboratory abnormalities a re to be recorded as AEs only if they lead to treatment discontinuation 
and/or modification of dosing and/or fulfill a serious criterion and/or are defined as an AESI. 
Laboratory values will be reported in the appropriate pages of eCRF.  
Instructions for AE  reporting are summarized in  Table  10.

The statistical considerations presented in this section forms the basis for the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP), which will provide accurate definitions and detailed specifications for the anal yses to 
be performed on the data collected from this study. A final SAP will be issued prior to first patient 
treated.  
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE   
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy endpoint (ie, PFS). The following 
assumptions  were used : 
• PFS has an exponential distribution in both treatment groups . 
• Pd arm has a median PFS of 4.0 months .  
• IPd arm will have 40% risk reduction in hazard rate in comparison to Pd arm. The targeted 
hazard ratio is 0.60, which corresponds to an improvement in the true median progression 
free survival time from 4 months to 6.67 months.  
• A log -rank test at a one -sided 2.5% significance level.  
Based on the above assumptions, a tota l of 162 PFS events are needed to achieve a 90% power for 
the study.  
Objective for OS also support the sample size calculation using the following assumptions:  
• OS has an exponential distribution in both treatment groups . 
• Pd arm has a median OS of 13.0 months.  
• IPd will have 31.5% risk reduction in hazard rate in comparison to Pd arm. The targeted 
hazard ratio is 0.685 and this is expected to correspond to a difference of 6 months in 
median OS between the control arm and the experimental arm.  
• A log -rank t est at a one -sided 2.5% significance level.  
• An interim analysis for efficacy assessment on OS is planned at the time of primary 
analysis on PFS which is estimated to occur when about 36% of the OS events will be 
observed  and a second interim analysis is pl anned when approximately 90% of the OS 
events have occurred . An O’Brien and Fleming  α-spending function will be used to obtain 
the nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses of survival  (see 
Section  11.5). 
Based on the above assumptions, a total of 220 deaths are needed to achieve 79.3% power for the 
study.  
A maximum of 300 patients (150 in each arm ) would be adequate to achieve the targeted number 
of events for both PFS and OS. After the PFS analysis, no more patients will be randomized and 
OS analysis will be performed on the number of patient already randomized.

11.4.2  Analyses of efficacy endpoints   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s)   
The primary analysis of PFS will be based on the following censoring rules: If progression and 
death are not ob served before the analysis cut -off date, PFS will be censored at the earliest of the 
date of the last valid disease assessment not showing disease progression performed prior to 
initiation of a further anti myeloma treatment (if any) or the analysis cut -off date, whichever 
comes first.  
Primary analysis will consist of PFS comparison between IPd gr oup versus Pd group through 
a 1-sided log -rank test procedure stratified by  [CONTACT_787655] (ie, age 
and number of previous lines of therapy ).  
This analysis will be performed on the ITT population.  
Response will be determined according to IMWG criteria  (1). The date of disease progression is 
the date of the first documented (and further confirmed) progression according to IMWG criteria 
as assessed by [CONTACT_35836] C. For patients without measurable M protein on Cycle 1 D1 efficacy laboratory 
results, progression and date of progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_787706] D . 
A patient without an event (death or disease progression) and without any valid post -baseline 
disease assessments will be censored at the day of randomization (Day 1).  
The cut -off date for the analysis of PFS is expected to be the date when the 16 2nd event (first 
occurrence of either disease progression or death due to any cause) has been observed.  
The estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be provided 
using a Cox proportional hazard model stratified by [CONTACT_787707] -rank test described above. The survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier 
estimates . At the time of PFS final analysis , critical value for the logrank test on PFS hazard rate 
would be 0.734.  
Sensitivity analyses of PFS will be performed (eg, different censoring rules and PFS assessed by 
[CONTACT_737]).

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1083718] overall response, ORR and clinical benefit rate will be summarized  using the ITT population  
with descriptive statistics at the time of the primary analysis on PFS (based on data collected up to 
the PFS analysis cut -off date). Confidence intervals will be computed using the Clopper -Pearson 
method. ORR will be compared between treatment groups usi ng Cochran Mantel Haenszel 
stratified method.  
The analysis on key secondary endpoint will also consist of OS comparison between the IPd 
group versus  the Pd group through a 1-sided log -rank test procedure. Patients without death prior 
to the analysis cut -off date will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive or 
the cut -off date, whichever is earlier. This analysis will be performed on the ITT population at the 
time of the primary analysis on PFS (at about 36% information  fraction ), at the time when 
approximately 90% of OS events have occurred,  and at the end of the study (final analysis on 
OS). An O’Brien and Fleming α -spending function will be used to obtain the nominal significance 
levels for the interim and final analyses of survival . The nominal significance (one -sided) level for 
the final survival comparisons would be of 0. 0200 for 220 death events (corresponding to a HR of 
0.758). 
If death is not observed before the analysis data cut-off date, data on OS will be censored at the 
date patient is known to be alive or at the cut -off date, whichever comes first.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Analysis of other secondary efficacy endpoints   
Other se condary efficacy endpoints include:  TTP, PFS in the high risk cytogenetic population, 
and DOR. These time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed at the time of the primary analysis on 
PFS using Kaplan -Meier methods. Among patients who achieve  a CR, the number  of patients 
without MRD will be provided.  
Similarly to  the primary analysis  of PFS , if progression and deaths (excluding TTP) are  not 
observed before the analysis data cut-off date, TTP, PFS in the high risk cytogenetic population, 
and DOR will be censore d at the date of the last valid disease assessment not  showing disease 
progression performed prior to initiation of further  anti-myeloma  treatment (if any) or the data 
cut-off date, whichever comes first . The DOR will not be calculated for patients that do  not 
achieve a response.  
Analysis of the prespecified secondary endpoints will be descriptive only. Any testing procedure 
carried out on these endpoints will be considered as exploratory.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiplicity considerations   
Hypothesis testing of the key secondary efficacy endpoints will be carried out. A closed test 
procedure will be used to control the Type I error rate meaning that not further testing will be

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of pharmacokinetic variables   
The population PK of isatuximab  will be characterized in the population of patients in the 
experimental arm, using a nonlinear mixed effect model ing approach . Both rich and sparse 
sampling pharmacokinetic data available from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies will be used for the 
analysis. Additional details of the analysis p lan and the results will be provided in a separate 
document. The population estimates from this analysis will provide a prior distribution from 
which individual Bayesian estimates of the PK parameters for each patient in this study will be 
derived.  
Pharmac okinetic parameters of isatuximab  will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (such as 
mean, geometric mean, median, SD, SEM, CV, minimum, and maximum).  
11.4.5  Analyses of immunogenicity   
The immunogenicity for isatuximab will be assessed by [CONTACT_787712], the percentage of ADA positive patients (either treatment induced, or those with 
increased titers during treatment), and the percentage of ADA negative p atients.  
ADA prevalence (proportion of patients tested positive at any point in time) and ADA incidence 
(propor tion of patients seroconverted - treatment induced ADAs - or having increased titers 
during the study) will be calculated.  
In addition, ADA titers will be summarized by [CONTACT_787713] . 
The impact of positive immune response will be evaluated on efficacy, PK and safety  endpoints.  
11.4.6  Analyses of patient reported outcomes ( HRQL /health economics ) variables   
Change from baseline for the following variables from E ORTC QLQ -C30: global HRQL, 
five functional scales (physical, emotional, cognitive, role and social) and nine symptom domains 
(fatigue,  nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and 
financial difficulties); for the MY -20: future perspective,  body image, disease symptoms and side 
effects of treatment; and for the EQ -5D-5L: health state utility value a nd VAS scores will be 
analyzed with an MMRM approach. Descriptive statistics including number of patients, mean and 
standard error will be provided. In addition, LS means, difference in LS means, the corresponding 
95% CI’s and the p -values will be provided  for comparison between treatment arms.  
Responder analyses will also be conducted using established MIDs (to be described in SAP) for 
each of the above variables.  
Each of the following criteria will be assessed via a comparison of change scores from baseli ne to 
EOT  and [ADDRESS_1083724] study treatment administration  between treatment arms:

In addition, responder analyses will be conducted:  
1. For those who improve.  
2. For those who deteriorate . 
3. For those who stay the same . 
4. Time to definitive improvement, and time to definitive deterioration will be based using  
the CID s defined in Appendix H , Appendix I , and Appendix J . 
5. Deterioration will be considered definitive if no later improvement above the defined 
thresholds (CIDs defined in Appendix H , Appendix I , and Appendix J ) are observed, prior

11.4.7  Other analyse(s)   
The impact of  a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency on study 
conduct will be summarized (eg, study discontinuation or discontinuation/delay/omission of the 
intervention due to the emergency). Any additional analyses and methods required to evaluate the 
impact on efficacy (eg, missing data due to the emergency) and safety will be detailed in the SAP.

the outcome of the final analysis of the primary endpoint). An i nterim analysis on OS could be 
performed at that stage. An additional interim analysis on OS will be performed when 
approximately 90% of events have occurred.  
At the time of final PFS analysis, formal comparisons of PFS, ORR and OS will be made 
according t o a closed test procedure  at the level of 2.5% one -sided.  
If an improvement in median PFS is demonstrated (according to the P FS final analysis presented 
in Section  11.4.2 ), the analysis on ORR and interim analysis on OS will be performed. The ORR 
will be tested, at the one sided 2.5% -level. Then, if the improvement in ORR is also significant, 
OS will be tested as a formal comparison that would allow for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_787642].

Disease response will be assessed using the updated International Myeloma Working Group 
Response Criteria (IMWG)  (1). A confirmation assessment for disease response within 4  weeks is 
required in this protocol (either MR or better, or PD).  
As a reminder, patients with measurable FLC only at screening are not eligible in the study . 
M protein value on Cycle 1 day 1 will be taken as baseline value  for response assessment . 
PD cannot  not be diagnosed on serum FLC increase only , even in patients for whom serum 
and urine M-protein become below level of eligibility on efficacy  laboratory performed on 
Cycle  1 Day 1  (see below the table for assessment of overall response and progression diagnosis  
of these patients).

of bone are not necessarily evidence of disease progression.  
Reminder:  definitions of Response and Progression are based on IMWG Uniform Reporting 
Criteria:  
• Any response category (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR , and MR) or progressi on needs to be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_787728] e assessments according to the S tudy Flow Chart. A 
diseas e assessment at one time point not matched by [CONTACT_787729] (except for progression by [CONTACT_9661], bone 
marrow PC counts, where one time point is adequate for confirmed response or 
progressio n). 
• Urine M -protein is not needed to document partial response or minor response if baseline 
urine M -protein was not measurable; however, it is still required for complete response 
and very good partial response.  
• Documentation of response requires two cons ecutive readings of the applicable disease 
parameter (serum M -protein, urine M -protein), performed at any time (no minimum 
interval is required, it can be done the same day); however, to confirm response or 
progressive disease, two discrete samples are req uired; testing cannot be based upon the 
splitting of a single sample.  
• Patients will continue in the last confirmed response category until there is confirmation of 
progression or improvement to a higher response status; patients cannot mo ve to a lower 
response category . 
• Percent decreases for response calculations are from baseline values  (Cycle 1, Day 1). 
• Percent increases for progression calculations are from lowest response values or baseline 
values, whichever is the smaller number . The lowest value does not need to be confirmed . 
• The lowest confirmed value before suspected progression will be used as baseline for 
calculation of progression; if a serum and/or urine spi[INVESTIGATOR_787645], this value can be assigned as zero as a baseline f or documentation of 
subsequent progressive disease. Patients will be considered to have progressive disease if 
they meet the criteria for progression by a variable that was not considered measurable at 
baseline; however, for  patients who had a measurable serum or urine M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_787646], 
progression cannot be defined by [CONTACT_787730] . 
• Radiographic and bone marrow assessments do not need to be confirmed.  
Patients with serum and urine M-Protein below level of eligibility on efficacy laborato ry 
performed on Cycle 1 Day 1  (eg, patients with only FLC measurable disease according to 
IMWG , M-protein value >0 [or IFX positive] and <0.5 g/dL ): 
• Patients with M -protein (urine and/or serum) below the level of measurability  (M-protein 
value >0 [or IFX p ositive] and <0.5 g/dL)  can have CR, non -PD or PD responses only  
according to the increase or decrease of M protein or extramedullary disease if applicable,

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 147 Appendix E  Guidelines for the determination of the number of prior lines of 
therapy in Mult iple Myeloma   
Line of Therapy  
A line of therapy consists of ≥1 complete cycle of a single a gent, a regimen consisting of 
a combination of several drugs, or a planned sequential  therapy of various regimens  
(eg, 3-6 cycles of initial therapy with bortezomib -dexamethasone followed by [CONTACT_787731], and lenalidomide maintenance is considered 1 line).  
New line of Therapy  
A treatment is considered a new line  of therapy if any 1 of the following 3 conditions are met:  
1. Start of a new line of treatment after discontinuation of a previous line.  If a treatment 
regimen is discontinued for any reason and a different regimen is started, it should be 
considered a new l ine of therapy. A regimen is considered to have been discontinued if all 
the drugs in that given regimen have been stopped. A regimen is not considered to have 
been discontinued if some of the drugs of the regimen, but not all, have been discontinued.  
The reasons for discontinuation, addition, substitution, or SCT do not influence how lines 
are counted. It is recognized that reasons for change may include end of planned therapy, 
toxicity,  progression, lack of response, inadequate response . 
2. The unplanned add ition or substitution of 1 or more drugs in an existing regimen. 
Unplanned addition of a new drug or switching to a different drug (or combination of 
drugs) due to any reason is considered a new line of therapy.  
3. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) : In patients  undergoing >[ADDRESS_1083738] with a predefined interval (such as 3 months), each SCT (autologous 
or allogeneic) should be considered a new line of therapy regardless of whether the 
conditioning regimen used is the same or different. It is recommend that data on type of 
SCT also be captured.  
Planned tandem SCT is considered 1 line. Planned induction and/ or consolidation , 
maintenance with any SCT (frontline, relapse, autologous  or allogeneic) is considered 
1 line.

• However, if  a regimen is interrupted or d iscontinued for any reason, and then  restarted at a 
later time point but 1 or more other regimens were  administered in between, or the 
regimen is modified through the  addition of 1 or more agents, then it should be counted as

Refractory M yeloma:  
Refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is non -responsive (failure to achieve minimal 
response or develops PD while on therapy) while on primary or salvage therapy, or progresses 
within [ADDRESS_1083739] therapy.  There are 2 categories of refra ctory myeloma.  
• Relapsed and refractory myeloma:  Relapsed and refractory myeloma is defined as disease 
that is non -responsive while on salvage therapy or progresses within [ADDRESS_1083740] achieved minimal response or better at s ome point previously 
to then progressing in their disease course.  
• Primary refractory myeloma: refractory myeloma is  defined as disease that is 
non-responsive in patients who have never achieved minimal response or better with any 
therapy. It includes patients who never achieve MR or better in whom there is no 
significant change in M protein and no evidence of clinical progression; as well as primary 
refractory, progressive disease where patients meet criteria for true progressive disease.  
Relapsed myel oma 
Relapsed myeloma is defined as previously treated myeloma which progresses and requires the 
initiation of salvage therapy but does not meet the criteria for either primary refractory myeloma 
or relapsed and refractory myeloma.

declared by a governmental agency   
Continuation of the study in the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency : 
A regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency (eg, public health 
emergency, natural disaster, pandemic, and terrorist attack) may prevent access to the clinical trial 
site. 
Contingency procedures are suggested for an emergency that prevents access to the study site, to 
ensure the safety of the partici pants, to consider continuity of the clinical study conduct, protect 
trial integrity, and assist in maintaining compliance with GCP in Conduct of Clinical Trials 
Guidance. Sponsor agreement MUST be obtained prior to the implementation of these procedures 
for the duration of the emergency.  
The decision for each individual participant to remain in the study should be made on a case by 
[CONTACT_787735]. The clinical judgment of the treating 
physician should guide the manag ement plan of each participant based on individual benefit/risk 
assessment and the evolving situation at the site ( Section  8.2.6 ). 
When participants are already randomized and/or treated, attempts should be made to perform all 
assessments in accordance with the protocol to the extent possible.  
When possible, the focus should be on IMP administration and safety blood collection 
(eg, biochemistry and hematology). However, all efforts should be made to perform the 
measurements of key parameters for efficacy endpoints (eg, disease  assessments). The deviations 
from the study protocol (eg, treatment  delay, omission, tests not performed) shou ld be 
documented in the source document and collected in the appropriate pages of the eCRF.  
Procedures to be considered in the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency:  
• If onsite visits are not possible, remote visits (eg , with home nurses, home health vendor, 
etc) may be planned for the collection of possible safety data.   
• If onsite visits are not possible visit windows may be extended for assessment of safety 
and/or efficacy data that cannot be obtained remotely.  
• The Dir ect-to-Patient supply of dexamethasone  and pomalidomide from the site/sponsor 
where allowed by [CONTACT_787736]  (Section  8). 
Contingencies implemented due to emergency will be documented.  
The impact of the regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency on study 
conduct will be summarized (eg, study discontinuation or discontinuation/dela y/omission of the 
intervention due to the emergency). Any additional analyses and methods required to evaluate the

EFC14335  - isatuximab  Version number: [ADDRESS_1083748] on efficacy (eg, missing data due to the emergency) and safety will be detailed in the SAP 
(Section  11.4.7 ). 
For a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, contingency procedures 
may be implemented for the duration of the emergency. The parti cipant or their legally authorized 
representative should be verbally informed prior to initiating any changes that are to be 
implemented for the duration of the emergency (eg, study visit delays/treatment extension, use of 
local labs) ( Section  12.2).

This amended protocol (amendment 06) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10(a) of Dir ective 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union because it significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental integrity of 
participants.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The introduction of proteasome inhibitors , immu nomodulatory drugs, and more recently 
monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of multiple myeloma have steadily improved patient’s 
survival. Patients diagnosed and treated after introduction of these agents have better survival 
outcomes ( 26, 27, 28). It is expected that survival in study EFC14335 will be longer than 
originally projected per protocol consistent with this observed trend reported in the literature . 
Based on the projection, the study cut -off date for the final overall survival ( OS) analysis will be 
substantially later than originally planned. Therefore, the Sponsor decided to add a second interim 
analysis of OS at approxima tely 90% of events, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_787649] 220 OS events 
will be reported.

Amended  Clinical Trial Protocol 3: [13 -Sep-2018]  
This amended protocol (amendment 03 ) is considered to be nonsubstantial based on the criteria 
set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 
the European Union beca use it neither significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental integrity 
of participants nor the scientific value of the study.  
Rationale for amendment:  
At the request of the Japanese regulatory authorities, the Sponsor has to provide progression free 
survival (PFS) data of the Japanese population enrolled into the study based on the assessment of 
the Independent Review Committee. This amendment allows the  Sponsor to continue collecting 
and analyzing central laboratory disease assessment of Japanese patients after the global study 
cut-off date .

End of treatment  Addition of electrocardiogram (ECG) 
assessments  Isatuximab being a monoclonal antibody, ie, a large 
protein, has a low likelihood to inhibit hERG. 
Available clinical data does not show any e vidence 
of repolarization problems. After interaction with US 
Federal Drug Administration, the agency agrees with 
this fact, although they encouraged the Sponsor to 
add the ECG assessments as a precautionary 
measure at the end of treatment and once during the 
study; electrocardiogram assessments were 
therefore added at Cycle 2 Day 1 (pre -dose) and at 
end of treatment.

 The requirement for pomalidomide to be  taken 
without food (at 2 hours before or 2 hours after a 
meal) was removed, this change was made to reflect 
updates to the pomalidomide prescribing

follow -up visits  Clarification of radiographic assessments 
for bone disease  Updates were made to state there  are two options 
for assessment of bone disease: skeletal survey and 
low-dose whole -body CT scan. This change was 
made in order to improve and optimize the way bone 
disease is assessed at baseline and during the 
study. The assessment of extramedullary dise ase 
was updated in order to clarify that in patients with 
known extramedullary disease at baseline a CT -
scan or MRI is to be done at baseline and every 
12 weeks (+/ - 1 week) and for those with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_787651] (including bone 
plasmacytoma) a CT scan or MRI is to be performed 
to confirm or rule -out its presence at baseline. If 
confirmed, the same approach as known 
involvement is to be followed.

chart and Section 10.1.1 
Screening/baseline  Add wording allowing to explore 
cytogenetic abnormalities other than 
del(17p); t(4:14); t(14:16)  The reason for this change is that even if three 
alterations defining the high -risk disease are well 
established there are emerging data showing that 
some cytogenetic alterations would have additional 
impact on the prognosis of patients.

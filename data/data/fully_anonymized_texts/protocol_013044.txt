3. Abstract:  
Burn pain is known to be one the most severe forms of acute pain often requiring 
large amounts of narcotics in addition to other adjuvants.  Wounds can also cause a great deal of pain in this population.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_632007].  The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of topi[INVESTIGATOR_632008].  During this study we will be 
monitoring for  evidence of  delayed wound healing, and surgical site infection.  
4.  Background:  
Pain from burns is a severe form of acute pain that requires aggressive use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_232000].
[ADDRESS_843752] potential for central nervous system (seizures (>5mg/L)) and cardiovascular toxicity (arrhythmias (>9mg/L)).
4 Plasma concentration of lidocaine depend upon drug dose, rate of 
absorption, patient weight, physical status and thickness of skin harvested. 6A prior 
study where up to 6.7mg/kg of 2% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_632009] #201400019  Page 3 of 26 
IRB version 03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 12/08/2016  graft sites found that systemic lidocaine levels  were far below toxic levels at their 
peak (average level of 1.4, with maximum level at 2.2). In this study the levels 
peaked between [ADDRESS_843753], reduces narcotic 
requirements while not affecting wound healing or causing toxic blood concentrations. In both these studies systemic intravenous lidocaine levels were monitored and were found to be significantly below toxic limits.
2,9  The use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_632010], partly for fear the lidocaine will interfere with wound healing and/or dressing adherence. No study to date has demonstrated lidocaine solution to be effective on burn sites when used in 
conjunction with TheraBond  silver foam dressing.  TheraBond is an absorbent, 
atraumatic dressing coated with ionic silver  that is routinely used on donor sites at 
our institution. This study will also offer additional supporting evidence that topi[INVESTIGATOR_632011] e is effective in post -operative  pain management of donor skin sites and 
should be more widely utilized. In addition, this study will serve as a steppi[INVESTIGATOR_632012] .   
5. S
pecific Aims:  
The purpose of this study is to offer the medical community data on a simple and relatively cheap adjuvant that can be utilized to help reduce the amount of post -
operative pain and narcotic requirement in burn and wound patients requiring skin 
grafts. 
 
6. Research Plan:  
 
Study Design  
 
a) Randomized Controlled Double- Blind Study  
b) Burn and wound patients undergoing general anesthesia for split thickness 
skin graft with a 1-15% TBSA donor site who will be treated at UF Health 
Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
c) Consent will be obtained from non-intubated patients  willing to participate in 
the study  that are admitted to the Burn Service for treatment of their burn or 
wound . All patients will undergo general anesthesia. Standard induction will 
be performed with Fentanyl and Propofol. Maintenance will primarily be with 
the volatile agent sevofluorane . Acetaminophen 1g IV and Ketorolac 30mg IV 
will be administered for baseline pain control intraoperative within the last 30 minutes prior to extubation.  Fentanyl , Hydromorphone or Morphine will be

Hydromorphone, as needed (PRN), orders will be written for pain control in 
the recovery room  as well as one time dose of Oxycodone 5- 15mg PO. If 
patient requires more than 2mg of Hydromorphone then subsequent pain will 
be treated with Ketamine IV (10mg every 15 minutes up to 50mg total) and 1-
2mg of IV midazolam.  If pain is still not adequately controlled patient will be 
treated with an additional 2mg of Hydromorphone IV  and Hydromorphone 
PCA will be initiated . Once discharged from the PACU to the surgical floor the 
patient will have PRN Oxycodone PO e very 4 hours and/or Hydromorphone 
PO every [ADDRESS_843755] 24 
hours following surgery will be compared between the two groups as well as self-reported donor site and overall pain according to the Verbal Numerical 
Rating Scale (VNRS)  obtained from the patient by [CONTACT_632026][INVESTIGATOR_632013].  
d) Lidocaine 2% with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 10µg/mL  will be placed on the donor site 
immediately following harvesting until hemostasis has been obtained per the surgeon. The total of up to 7mg/kg, as recommended by [CONTACT_632027], of lidocaine solution will also be sprayed onto the patient’s donor 
site based on patient’s ideal weight (BMI 25 or actual patient’s weight if BMI 
<25).
10 
e) 50patients split into t wo(study & control) groups.  
a. Group A patients will  have sterile 2% lidocaine with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 10 µg/mL (Solution A1) soaked in surgical grade cotton applied to the donor site immediately after donor h arvest until  hemostasis is obtained 
according to the  surgeon.  If additional hemostasis is deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_632028] 20cc (1 vial) of this Solution A1 then additional Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 10µg/mL will be used as per standard burn protocol.  Following hemostasis, patients will have a sterile , 
nonpyrogenic  solution of lidocaine 2 % in isotonic saline  (Solution A 2) 
sprayed on the donor site of the grafted skin prior to emergence from general anesthesia.  A maximum of 7mg/kg of lidocaine solution will be 
available for spraying. The site will then be covered with TheraBond 
dressing as per standard burn care used at our institution.  
b. Group B (control group) patients will have sterile Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  10µg/mL 
solution (Solution B1)  soaked in surgical grade cotton applied to the 
donor site immediately  after donor harvest . A 20cc aliquot will prepared 
in such a way as to be indistinguishable from Solution A1 by [CONTACT_242011]. If additional hemostasis is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_632028] 20cc (1 vial) of this Solution B1 then additional Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 10µg/mL will  be used as per standard burn protocol.   
Following hemostasis, patients w ill have  a control (placebo) sterile , 
nonpyrogenic  solution of isotonic saline (Solution B 2) sprayed over the 
donor site.   The site will then be covered with TheraBond dressing as 
per standard burn care used at our institution.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 12/08/2016  f) Assessment of the donor sites using the VNRS pain scores will be compared 
between groups in addition to the amount of narcotic pain medication required 
by [CONTACT_632029].  The amount of narcotic utilized will be analyzed per 
ideal body weight, per actual body weight in addition to donor site area.  
g) Lidocaine levels will be drawn at sixty minutes and six hours from application of study solution. These levels will be analyzed on a per patient and per graft size area basis to trend for systemic levels.  
h) Any adverse event occurring with the patient will be analyzed on a case- by-
case basis. Wound infection rates of the donor sites at post op day 14- 21 +/ -[ADDRESS_843756] per institution policy.  
i) All care offered during this treatment, including intraoperative medication use, surgical application of dressing and post -operative wound assessments are 
currently part of standard burn care at our institution. The only new variable we are analyzing is the addition of the lidocaine/ placebo solution  to the donor 
site intraoperatively .  
 
Intraoperatively a TheraBond dressing will be applied to the donor site that later 
“falls off” once the site has healed.   Outer dressings of gauze, Bioguard and 
Acewraps will also be applied, covering the Therabond and will be changed daily 
per standard of care.  Wound healing of the donor site will be evaluated visually 
by [CONTACT_632030]. In addition, photographs of the donor sites will be obtained 
intraoperatively and at the time t he TheraBond comes off.  
Study Procedures  
 
a. Subject selection procedures  
i. Inclusion criteria: Adult patients who have suffered second to third degree burns  or have a wound requiring a single split 
thickness skin graft  surgery . Donor sites will be estimated to be 
between 1-15% TBSA. Patients who have history of major renal 
and/or liver dysfunction, history of seizures or major neurologic deficiencies, allergy to local anesthetics,  reported allergy to 
hydromorphone,  pregnancy, or currently have other injuries that 
significantly contribute to pain (i.e. multi -trauma patients) will be 
excluded from the study.  
ii. Consent will be obtained from all patients. The risk and benefit topi[INVESTIGATOR_632014] a consent for this study will be obtained. Burn and wound patients require 
high doses during wound related procedures and for post-
operative pain control. At other times their background pain is 
easily controlled by [CONTACT_632031]; they remain alert and are capable of making complex decisions.

hand and demonstrate an inability to focus on the consent they will not be considered for enrollment in the study.  
b. Randomization procedures: Numerical randomization will be created  
using a computer generated numbers.  Randomization envelopes will be created by [CONTACT_632032].  The Burn Study Team will alert the Investigational Drug Pharmacy to randomize each patient .    The Investigational Drug 
Pharmacy will dispense the appropriate blinded solution for treatment.  
The Investigational Drug Pharmacy will dispense Lidocaine with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632015]. A 20cc bottle of Lidocaine with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632016] a sterile unlabeled container prior to application of sprayed study treatment. The surgeon and OR team will remain blinded for this portion of the study. If additional hemostasis is required beyond the first study soak treatment; then the standard of

 Safety Monitoring Plan  
a. The likelihood of adverse events in this study is very small. Lidocaine spray doses will be calculated (7mg/kg based on ideal body weight)  to 
ensure patient is  receiving safe doses . A safety analysis performed on our 
first 15 patients proved  safety. All lidocaine levels obtained demonstrated 
levels significantly lower than potentially toxic dosing. We believe there could be improved pain control if more appropriate ( higher ) lidocaine 
doses are utilized. The method suggested for hemostasis with lidocaine 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_632018]. It is regularly used by [CONTACT_319581]. In addition, one of the surgeons in our study has used this method in the past.  
b. Patient s will be monitored with pulse oximetry overnight  per standard of 
care.  
c. All patients enrolled in the study will have risks and benefits thoroughly explained to them.  
d. Any adverse events will be well documented and thoroughly investigated.  
Seriousness of event will be assessed by [CONTACT_079].  All events deemed serious will be submitted to the University of [LOCATION_012] Institutional Review Board in accordance with institutional policy.  
e. Dressing site will be evaluated daily per standard of care by [CONTACT_632034][INVESTIGATOR_2345] .  
f. After [ADDRESS_843761] been enrolled a second safety  
analysis will be performed; all investigators will be involved in data interpretation.  
 
Analysis Plan  
 An independent groups t -test (Student’s t -test) will be performed to 
compare the mean rating between the difference of the  two reported pain 
scale ratings.  Each patient will be used as his/her own control by 
[CONTACT_632035].  An alpha level 
of 0.05 and power of 0.8 will be used to address the difference in the two groups. Given the desired alpha the sample size was estimated by [CONTACT_094]-
determined tables for certain values, by [CONTACT_632036]’s resource equation. With an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.8 it is estimated that 25 patients in each

will be performed to compare the mean quantity of hydromorphone required between the two groups. An alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.8 will be used to address the difference in the two groups.  
   
7.  Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
 The patient’s regular medical care will not change because they are enrolled in this study. 
Possible risks to you may include:  
• The risks from skin grafting and donor site include those associated with any 
surgical procedure that involves general anesthesia.  These include reactions to the anesthesia, medications, nausea, pain, problems breathing, excessive bleeding, and infection.    
• If a wound becomes infected, it may result in the need for further surgical treatment.  Surgical treatment could include debridement of the wounded area (surgical removal of dead or infected tissue of the wound), and/or regrafting. Because your doctor looks at the wounds very closely, he/she will try to take care of any complications as fast as they can.  The treatment of side effects and complications will be the same that would be expected for the treatment of side effects and complications for any skin g rafting and  donor 
site procedure performed at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• Side effects of Lidocaine include:  Nausea, drowsiness, mental/mood 
changes, ringing in the ears, dizziness, vision changes, tremors, numbness, headache and backache.  Serious adverse effects could include fever, unusually fast and slow pulse, trouble breathing, seizures and chest pain.  An  
allergic reaction to Lidocaine could include: rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, and trouble breathing.  
• Side effects of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of puncture;  possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an 
infection; and, uncommonly, faintness from the procedure.  Blood drawn each time will be approximately 5 teaspoons.  The total amount drawn during the study will be approximately 10 teaspoons .

Patients randomized to the treatment group may have increased satisfaction, 
increased pain control, decreased narcotic usage, and a decrease in chronic pain.  
9. Conflict of Interest:  
There is no conflict of interest involved with this study beyond professional benefit from academic publication or presentation of results.

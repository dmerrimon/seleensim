 1. Background and Rationale  
 
The prescribing of inappropriate medications for older adults is extremely common in the 
[LOCATION_002], ranging from 12% in community settings to 40% of those who are institutionalized.1-[ADDRESS_1138932] commonly 
prescribed in circumstances that are inconsistent with practice guidelines.3,4 While inappropriate 
prescribing increases the risk of adverse health consequences for all patients, older adults are 
particularly vulnerable.2,5-7 Physicians’ lack of awareness of alternatives, ambiguous practice 
guidelines, and perceived pressure of patients or caregivers are among the reasons why these 
drugs are used more than might be optimal.[ADDRESS_1138933] (EHR) systems. While EHR strategies 
are widely used to support the informational needs of providers, these tools have demonstrated only modest effectiveness at improving prescribing.
8-[ADDRESS_1138934] also 
been criticized for the sheer volume of alerts, the lack of clinical significance of the tools, and  the 
poor/delayed timing of the clinical decision support (i.e., after the prescribing decision). Accordingly , the effectiveness of these tools could be enhanced by [CONTACT_722316] -gained 
insights from  behavioral economics and other related sciences. Their application to EHRs has 
been limited, and they have not been used to reduce the prescribing of potentially harmful 
medications to older adults.  
 
2. Study Aims  
The overall goal of the proposed research is to evaluate whether EHR -based tools , 
optimized using behavioral science principles , reduce inappropriate prescribing among older 
adults. Our overall hypothesis is that thoughtful incorporation of behavioral principles into 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138935] EHR tools 
or usual care .  Composite of 1) discontinuation 
of high-risk medications 
(benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], sedative hypnotics, or anticholinergics  
[in secondary analyses] ) or 2) 
ordering a gradual dose taper 
for one of these medications  These outcomes are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_722304].  
Secondary  
To examine whether behavioral 
science -based EHR tools 
reduce cumulative prescribing 
of high- risk medications in 
older adults compared with 
usual care .  Quantity of high -risk medication 
prescribed, defined by [CONTACT_821641]- risk medications 
prescribed to patients in follow -
up  These outcomes capture the extent to 
which high -risk medications are 
cumulatively prescribed to patients by [CONTACT_821642] -up 
period.  
Tertiary/Exploratory  
To evaluate whether behavioral 
science -based EHR tools reduce 
the risk of clinically -significant  
adverse drug events, falls, 
fractures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or 
emergency room visits  
compared with usual care.  Rates of adverse drug events, 
falls, fractures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and emergency room visits in follow -up; quantity of high- risk 
medications dispens ed to 
patients in follow -up period  These outcomes measure clinical  
outcomes that are consequences of these 
high-risk medications, measured in medical 
and pharmacy administrative claims data.  
 
 
3. Study Design 
 
3.1 Study site 
 
The adaptive trial will be conducted in outpatient and acute care practices of  Atrius 
Health, a large integrated delivery network in eastern and central [LOCATION_005]. The 
replication trial will be conducted in outpatient primary care practices at Mass General  Brigham 
(MGB), specifically Mass General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Atrius  and MGB  both ha ve a fully functional EHR, 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457] ( www.epi[INVESTIGATOR_722306].com ), that supports computerized ordering of medications . Atrius is 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022  
Trial Protocol  
7 
 comprised of 29 clinical and multi -specialty outpatient locations with 875 physicians.  MGB is 
comprised of 150 outpatient practices with over 1,800 physicians . 
 
3.2 Overall design  
 
We propose a n open- label adaptive 2 Stage  cluster -randomized, NIH -defined Stage  III 
pragmatic trial to evaluate whether EHR- based tools designed using behavioral principles reduce 
inappropriate prescribing and adverse outcomes among older adults  at Atrius Health (See Study 
Schema in Section 3.3) . After the successful completion of the adaptive trial , we will replicate the 
parallel group trial at Mass General Brigham , specifically within MGH primary care practices . We 
hypothesize that these tools will reduce prescribing of high- risk medications (primary outcome), 
cumulative prescribing of high- risk medications (secondary outc ome), and clinically -significant 
adverse drug events like sedation and confusion ( tertiary outcome) and cumulative utilization of 
high- risk medications (tertiary outcome) compared with usual care.  
Because there are many ways in which the tools could be str uctured and delivered, we will 
use an adaptive trial design at Atrius Health that involves two Stages of evaluation to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_821633].  We will 
randomize primary care providers at MGH to one of the [ADDRESS_1138936] promising treatment arms identified 
in the adaptive randomized trial conducted at Atrius Health or usual care. Primary care providers 
will be the unit of randomization.   
3.2.1 Stage  1 Design  
  In Stage  1 of the trial , we will randomize approximately 200 primary care providers at Atrius 
Health  approximately  equally to either usual care or active intervention . Of the half of providers 
randomized to active intervention, we will randomize them equally to one of 15 active intervention 
arms. Providers randomized to one of the 15  active intervention arms will receive an EHR tool to 
guide the care of their eligible patients. Providers randomized to usual care will receive no EHR 
tool, as is current clinical practice. Providers will be eligible for the trial if they prescribed a 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138937] one older adult in the 180 days prior to 
randomization. We will randomize providers within strat a based on their clinic size and baseline 
rates of high- risk medication prescribing.  
Eligible patients of these providers will be who meet the following criteria: 1) older adults 
(aged 65 years  or more)  and 2) who have been prescribed at least [ADDRESS_1138938] 180 day s.  
After 6 months ( dictated by [CONTACT_821643] , i.e., at least 1 
eligible patient  for whom the EHR tools fired per physician), an interim analysis of Stage  [ADDRESS_1138939] 
effective factors. After this interim analysis, the Stage 1 providers in the “winning” arms (i.e., the 
promising arms) will be randomly assigned to continue to receive their original treatment 
assignments  or to usual care to test holdover/persistency effects. Similarly, the Stage [ADDRESS_1138940] one older adult in the 180 
days prior to randomization for secondary anal yses. Providers randomized to one of the 5 selected 
treatment arms will receive an EHR tool to guide their care of eligible patients.  As in Stage 1, we 
will randomize providers based on demographic characteristics, patient case- mix factors, and 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138941] accrued.   
3.2.3 Replication Trial  Design  
 This replication trial is a cluster -randomized, NIH -defined Phase III pragmatic trial. The 
study statistician, in partnership with data analysts at MGB , will generate and implement the 
randomization scheme, with oversight by [CONTACT_941] P rincipal Investigators. All the study sites will be at 
MGH for this trial ; we have received approval from leadership at MGH primary care practices and 
Digital Health eCare teams to conduct this trial . For study evaluation, data regarding patients' 
medical history, disease control, medication use , and healthcare utilization will be obtained from 
EHR data or administrative claims data. The administrative claims data used for evaluation in this 
study will come directly from MGB  in HIPAA -limited datasets  through their risk -bearing contracts , 
as applicable.  
  We plan to randomize primary care providers at MG H to one of the [ADDRESS_1138942] promising of the arms for this parallel group trial. W e will randomize 
providers based on provider demographic characteristics, patient case -mix factors, and baseline 
rates of high- risk medication prescribing measured in EHR data .  
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138943] one older adult in the 180 days prior to randomization. Providers will 
receive these EHR tool s for their patients who meet the following criteria: 1) older adults (aged 
65 years or more), and 2) who have been prescribed at least [ADDRESS_1138944] 12 months. These patients will 
also be included in the analyses. The type and timing of EHR tool that the providers receive for these patients will vary based on their assigned int ervention arm.

 3.4 Scientific rationale for study design  
Because there are numerous ways in which these EHR tools could be designed using 
behavioral principles, we propose a randomized adaptive design at Atrius Health that will increase 
statistical efficacy  followed by a replication trial at MG H.16,17 This adaptive method has been used 
to improve the efficiency of traditional trials.16-20 We propose to sequential ly modify (i.e., adapt) the 
EHR tools that are presented to providers in the intervention groups based on identifying the tools 
that are the least and most successful at reducing inappropriate prescribing . This approach is 
highly feasible in the current context since the outcome on the basis of which intervention 
adaptation will occur (i.e., inappropriate prescribing) will be almost immediately observable using 
EHR data. This MGB replication trial will explicitly test replicability and scalability by [CONTACT_821644]. Further, the use of a randomized trial in this setting is scientifically justified, as this design will be able to provide evidence of causalit y in the effectiveness of the tools on reducing prescribing and 
rates of clinical outcomes. This replication trial  was also part of the specific aims submitted and 
approved by [CONTACT_153518] H. Further, the use of a randomized trial in this setting is scientifically justified, 
as this design will be able to provide evidence of causality in the effectiveness of the tools on 
reducing prescribing and rates of clinical outcomes. An observational stud y design, by [CONTACT_22242], 
would not provide the same degree of scientific rigor.  
 
3.5 Justification for intervention  
The focus areas for the EHR tools will be primarily drawn from the outpatient Choosing 
Wisely recommendations in geriatric medicine but are al so informed by [CONTACT_722324].21-23 In specific, we plan to focus on the following therapeutic 
classes: (1) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]; (2 ) sedative hypnotics (sleep medicines) and (3) anticholinergics. 
These classes were chosen because they all have established clinical guidelines recommending 
reductions in use, continue to be heavily over -prescribed, contribute significantly to poor clinical  
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138945] chosen to focus on key principles of behavioral economics and cognitive 
psychology to “nudge” provi ders to optimize prescribing, including timing, salience, framing, 
simplification, cold state outreach, pre -commitment, and boostering. T hese principles were 
selected based on their effectiveness in other settings24-27, their  applicability to the care of older 
adults , and their ability to be adapted to the EHR context.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1138946] of the Clarity 
and Payer databases. The Clarity database is a relational database that contains clinical and 
financial information from the Epic Suite of products; including the electronic  medical record 
system, the appointment scheduling syste m, the patient accounting system, and the master

 patient index (Identity). The various tables within the Clarity database are refreshed on a daily, 
weekly or monthly basis . 
For the claims data, the Medicare claims data are being provided by [CONTACT_175315], the 
National Institute on Aging (NIA), through their  partnership with Acumen and the established 
MedRIC (https://www.medric.info/data- enclave/data- pages/data) . In order to obtain claims data 
from the funder, we will provide them with Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) for linked patients in our study.  We are executing all appropriate data use agreements with the NIA and 
Acumen to receive these data. The claims data will be available for linked patients in our study.  
At MGB, we will extract clinical information from the electronic medical record system 
via the Epic Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) or the Mass General Brigham Research 
Patient Data Registry (RPDR). Accessing the EDW in particular is necessary in order to adequately identify and link all eligible patients seen by [CONTACT_821645], which is not possible using other sources.

Physician and patient subjects will be included based on their meeting eligibility criteria as 
part of routine care, and the study population will be highly inclusive. As at Atrius, w e expect these 
participants to cover a broad range of participants by [CONTACT_48984]/ethnicity.  Given the minimal 
risk nature of the study, par ticipants will not receive incentives, remuneration, or be required to 
provide informed consen t. 
 
5. Study Interventions 
5.1 Therapeutic areas 
The focus areas for the EHR tools will be primarily drawn from the outpatient Choosing 
Wisely recommendations in geriatric medicine but are also informed by [CONTACT_722324].4,29 In specific, we plan to focus on the following therapeutic 
classes: (1) benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]; (2)  sedative hypnotics (sleep medicines) and (3) 
anticholinergics.  
 
 
5.2 Study interventions 
 
Physicians  in the adaptive trial  randomized to one of the 15 active  intervention arms will 
receive one of se veral possible enhanced EHR decision support tools to guide their care of 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022  
Trial Protocol  
18 
 eligible patients when these patients come to the clinic for an appointment. Physicians in the 
replication trial randomized to one of the 3 active intervention arms will receive one of several 
possible enhanced EHR decision support to guide care. The type and timing of an alert will 
vary based on the intervention arm.  
These EHR tools will be tested in combination or on their own in the 1 5 active 
intervention arms outlined below  for the adaptive randomized trial at Atrius. The t wo specific 
EHR tools for the  replication trial at MGB will be determined based on the adaptive randomized 
trial results:

Arms 1 through 14  are enhanced  EHR tools to encourage the deprescribing of the 
medications under study.  Arm 15  is a basic EHR alert that is meant to represent  the type of 
clinical decision support that is commonly given to providers – without enhancements using 
behavioral science prin ciples (if any decision support is provided). Physicians randomized to 
usual care (Arm 16 ) will receive no intervention.  
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022  
Trial Protocol  
19 
 The central component of arms 1 through 14  will be an enhanced EHR alert (known as 
a Best Practice Advisory [BPA] ). The enhanced BPA will appear on each provider’s EHR 
screen and will contain several standard components .  The BPA will:  
1. give providers  information about why the medication is dangerous for their patient 
using the behavioral science principle of salience to mak e this information as 
impactful as possible;   
2. include a set of tips  to help providers discuss medication discontinuation with their 
patients ; 
3. ask provider s to select an acknowledgment reason if they decided not to discontinue 
the medication;  
4. include a SmartSet order set that will allow providers to order a gradual dose taper 
for their patient, which limits risks of withdrawal symptoms for the patients for 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722308] , order alternative medications, place a 
referral to a behavioral health specialist , provide instructions on how to make 
lifestyle modifications to improve patient symptoms, and add customizable patient 
instructions for how to gradually taper off benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722308], 
as applicable.  
The BPA will display either when the provider orders a medication (Order Entry) or 
opens the chart (Open Encounter)  for eligible patients , depending on the arm . In specific, the 
enhanced BPA will fire at Order Entry in Arms 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 ; the enhanced B PA 
will fire at Open Encounter in Arms 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, [ADDRESS_1138951] several other modifications to this enhanced BPA. In specific, as 
outlined in the table above, we will add in a boostering option in the enhanced BPA in Arms 3 
and 4, which is a provider -directed option for a follow -up in- basket message sent 4 weeks after 
the BPA is triggered. In Arms 5 and 6, we will incorporate a prior, “cold state”  outreach 
component , consisting of an in- basket message sent to the eligible provider 2 days before the 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138952] 
(e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_722308]) , the EHR tools will appear for both classes  
separately.  
 
5.3 Measures to minimize bias: randomization and blinding  
 
Providers  will be randomized to treatment arms in equal proportions  based on blocks . We 
will use pr ovider -based cluster randomization to minimize the possibility of contamination in 
study interventions between practices and clinic staff. For the randomization, we will use 
stratified randomization based on clinic practice size and baseline rates of prescribing  to 
reduce potential imbalances between the providers assigned to the treatment arms.   
The providers will not be blinded to which arm they were assigned to, as blinding is the 
context of an intervention that is intended to motivate action will be infeasible.  The study 
statistician, in partnership with data analysts at Atrius Health, will generate and implement the 
randomization scheme, with oversight by [CONTACT_5844].  Investigators will be blinded 
to the treatment arms during interim and final analyses . 
 
 
6. Study Assessments  and Procedures  
 
6.1 Baseline data  
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138953] baseline data on patients and providers using extracted EHR data and/or 
administrative claims data as applicable for the study aim. This baseline data will be used to 
assess any potential imbalances in the characteristics of providers or patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_722309]. The baseline data will include, but are no t limited to:  gender, rural/urban 
practice setting, baseline rates of prescribing, practice location, and patient case- mix. We will 
also collect patient  data that include but are not limited to: sociodemographic data , medical 
history and comorbidities, baseline resource utilization in prior 12 months (i.e., number of 
visits) , biometric values (e.g., serum creatinine, systolic/diastolic blood pressures) .  
 
 
6.2  Outcomes  
 
For both Stage s, the primary outcome will be a binary composite measure of a 
reduction in inappropriate prescribing, evaluated using EHR data from Atrius  Health.  In 
specific, we will measure a composite of 1) discontinuation of high -risk medications 
(benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], sedative hypnotics, or anticholinergics  [included in secondary analyses] ), 
defined by [CONTACT_5640] : a) active discontinuation and no subsequent order or b) no order during 
follow- up or 2) ordering a gradual dose taper (for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_821636]) . If 
either of these actions is taken by [CONTACT_3433] e provider for a specific patient at any point in the follow -
up window , we will classify the  patient as having had a reduction in inappropriate prescribing. If 
the patient has multiple therapeutic classes of interest (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_821637]), we will classify patients with a reduction for any class as a “reduction”  for the 
composite measure. In secondary analyses, we will include anticholin ergics. We will also 
stratify patients by [CONTACT_722325] (i.e., one, two, or three classes) 
and analyze outcomes within these strata.  
In Stage  2 and the replication trial , secondary outcomes include the quantity of high- risk 
medication prescribed, defined by [CONTACT_821646]- risk medications 
prescribed to patients in the follow -up period  to capture cumulative prescribing by [CONTACT_821647] -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022  
Trial Protocol  
22 
 at Atrius Health . As above, we will also strat ify patients by [CONTACT_821648] (i.e., one, two, or three classes) and analyze outcomes within these strata.  
In Stage  [ADDRESS_1138954] . 
In part icular, we will measure the quantity of high -risk medication dispensed, defined by 
[CONTACT_821646]- risk medications filled by [CONTACT_1962], in follow -up, using 
pharmacy claims data. Other tertiary outcomes will include the occurrence of  clinically -
significant adverse drug events, including but not limited to, sedation or cognitive impairment , 
and all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_821638], measured in administrative claims data . 
These clinical outcomes will be evaluated using vali dated  and CMS -driven  ICD-10-CM 
diagnosis and procedure- based algorithms applied to these patients’ medical and pharmacy 
administrative claims data. Because the sensitivity of clinical outcomes in EHR systems is 
known to be low (e.g., because patients may seek subsequent care at other healthcare 
systems), using routinely -collected data from insurers overcomes this limitation.30 We will also 
evaluate implementation of the intervention using structured deidentified data from the EHR 
about use of the EHR system , which will help inform how to scale the interventions  (see Data 
to be collected form) .  
At the conclusion of the trial, a brief optional survey will be administered electronically to 
providers who were included in the trial (see “Provider outreach email” and “Provider survey” in 
attachments). The purpose of the survey is to understand providers’ satisfaction with the 
decision support and what modifications they would recommend in the future. These findings 
will be used to help understand implementation of the decision support and potential for scalability to other settings. The surveys will be  prepared in MGB REDCap and delivered by 
[CONTACT_821649] [INVESTIGATOR_821639]. The survey will collect 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138955] any HIPAA 
identifiable information or information about patients. The study -specific provider identifier  and 
email address  will be the only identifier s, necessary for the evaluation of implementation and 
remuneration. Their servers are protected by [CONTACT_821650]. Non -
respondents will receive a second reminder email but otherwise receive no outreach. At the 
end of the survey, providers will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1138956]  or to prov ide their email .  
After the administration of the optional survey, Atrius providers included in the trial will 
be invited to participate in a one -time optional  qualitative interview (lasting about 20 -30 
minutes). The purpose of the interviews is to complem ent the surveys and understand barriers 
faced by [CONTACT_821651], how to improve the decision support, and how interested 
they would be in sustaining or building upon the interventions. Providers will be invited to 
participate via email delivere d by [CONTACT_821652]  (see “Provider interview outreach email”)  
based on physician factors , and if interested, they will be invited to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lauffenburger, 
the MGB investigator trained in qualitative methods who will conduct the interview ; by [CONTACT_5634], 
they will have provided implied consent to have their name [CONTACT_821667] , but otherwise there will be no other HIPAA identifiable information shared outside 
of Atrius . Other MGB staff or external individual will not have access; the provider will 
otherwise only be assigned a study identifier for the purpose of interview analysis. The 
interviews will not collect any HIPAA identifiable information about patients. Before proceeding 
with the interview, verbal consent will be obtained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lauffenburger. The interview will be 
conducted using a semi -structured interview guide (see “Provider interview guide”). Providers 
will be offered $100 for participating in the interview , administered by [CONTACT_821653].  In order 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138957] their use. The 
decision support provi des resources to help patients safely discontinue the high -risk 
medications under study (e.g., providing tapering guidelines and facilitating the substitution of 
lower -risk therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) . There is a theoretical risk of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_722314] , but the risk is less 
than the continued risks of ongoing use of the drugs being addressed by [CONTACT_169345] (See 
Section 8.5 for further detail).  
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138958] care to patients, and all treatment decisions will ultimately 
be made by [CONTACT_13935]’ own medical teams . As a result, any adverse events wi ll be handled 
in the course of regular clinical care. Further, to maximize the generalizability of the results and 
to avoid co- intervention, patients will not be required to have study -specific monitoring as part 
of the proposed pragmatic trials. Therefore, we do not plan to use any patient -directed 
prospective monitoring of Adverse Events ( AEs) or Significant Adverse Events ( SAEs ) in this 
trial. An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ 
involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.   
- Adverse Events  will be classified using the following rating scales:  
o Severity: Mild, Moderate or Severe  
 Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms but are easily tolerated  
 Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern but may 
interfere wit h daily activities but are usually improved by [CONTACT_39508]  
 Severe: Events interrupt the participants’ normal daily activities and 
generally require systemic drug therapy  
o Expectedness: Unexpected or Expected  
 Unexpected: nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
condition under study  
 Expected: event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.

 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) are defined as any  adverse event that  results in death, i s 
life thr eatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred , requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, causes persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity , results in congenital anomalies or birth defects , and i s another condition which 
investigators judge to represent significant hazards . 
However, our plan for data and safety monitoring does include multiple mechanisms to 
ensure minimal risk of participation in the trials.  We will leverage an automatic adverse event 
repor ting and review system to observe and monitor for any SAEs that do occur. In specific, 
providers report adverse events through an online reporting system. All reports are routinely 
reviewed by [CONTACT_821654] . Atrius, under the oversight of our Site PI, 
will use these reports to monitor for AEs and SAEs throughout the course of the study . Any 
reports of deaths will  be submitted to the NIA Program Officer and to the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) Chair or designated DSMB member within 24 hours. Any 
unanticipated SAEs deemed by [CONTACT_821655] [INVESTIGATOR_821640] 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of the SAE. All other reported SAEs and AEs 
received by [CONTACT_821656], unless otherwise requested by [CONTACT_116992] a Safety Officer.

 7. Statistical Considerations 
 
7.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
 
Our null hypothesis will be that rates of provider prescribing (defined by [CONTACT_110042] a 
reduction in prescribing of high -risk medication ) in any one of the intervention groups (defined 
by [CONTACT_821657]) will be no different than in the other arms, including the usual care arm.  
 
 
7.2  Sample size determination  
 
Adaptive Trial  
 We powered the study  for 1 5 active intervention arms with the following assumptions. 
We assumed a baseline rate of the composite outcome of 5% (i.e., that 5% of patients would 
have a medication discontinued or a taper ordered  in the follow -up window ), an intervention  
effect size of 15%  (i.e., Odds ratio of 1.15 of discontinuation compared with usual care ), 
alpha=0.05, power=0.8, and patient correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_1138959]  >80% power to detect absolute 
differences of 10% or smaller in the primary outcome between each of the intervention arms 
and usual care, assuming an intra- provider  correlation of 0. [ADDRESS_1138960] for physician -level 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022  
Trial Protocol  
28 
 clustering and multiple patient observations per physician.  The study arms will be analyzed 
using a multivariable regression model, in which each of features of the EHR tools (“factors”) 
will be included as covariates in an overall regression model that compares the effect of 
receiving an enhanced EHR decision supp ort tool compared with usual care.  In specific, these 
factors will include:  timing of EHR tool (open encounter=1, order entry=0), whether a follow -up 
alert is enabled as part of the tool (yes=1, no=0), cold state outreach is used (yes=1, no=0), 
simplificat ion is used (yes=1, no=0), sign-off is used (yes=1, no=0), pre- commitment is used 
(yes=1, no=0) or if different risks of the high -risk medications are presented within the EHR tool  
(yes=1, no=0). In this way, we will also observe and report an overall effect of the enhanced 
EHR tool compared with usual care as well as the effect of individual features through their 
coefficients in the model.  We will conduct this interim analysis once at the end of follow -up in 
Stage [ADDRESS_1138961] size at reducing prescribing of high -risk 
medications  from the covariate coefficients from the models . At the end of follow -up in Stage  1, 
we will also use these regression models to explore whether any of the intervention arms 
(defined by [CONTACT_821657]) are inferior to usual care. We will repeat these analyses at the end of 
Stage 2 using all available data to determine whether any of the intervention factors (and 
secondarily, arms ) were more effective than usual care at reducing prescribing of high- risk 
medications. In secondary analyses, we will include anticholinergics.  
Because this is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are planned as unadjusted; in 
secondary analyses, we will adjust for patient age, race/ethnicity, and gender. . Given the 
nature of the data and how the outcomes are categorized, there will not be missing va lues for 
the primary endpoint , as the absence of action is classified as no action by [CONTACT_13917] . For 
the primary analysis, w e will include all eligible patients in the denominator who had at least 
one in-person or telehealth visit with their primary care provider. In secondary analyses, we will 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138962] for clustering and repeated observations. For the inappropriate prescribing 
outcome, we will use a log link function and binary distributed errors. For the adverse clinical 
outcome s, we will use a log link function and binary distributed errors.  These models generate 
the estimated relative risks (RRs) with robust standard errors and are considered to be particularly appropriate when outcomes are c ommon (e.g., incidences of ≥10%).  Because this 
is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are planned as unadjusted; however, in secondary 
analyses, we will adjust for patient age, race/ethnicity, and gender.   
Given the nature of the data and how the outcomes are categorized, there will not be 
missing values for the primary endpoint, as the absence of action is classified as no action by 
[CONTACT_13917]. For the primary analysis, we will include all eligible patients in the denominator 
who had at least one visit with their primary care provider. In secondary analyses, we will 
include all eligible patients of those primary care providers in the denominator, regardless of whether the patient visited the provider over the follow -up period.  
 
 
7.3.2  Analysis of  secondary endpoints  
 
For the secondary outcome of cumulative medication prescribing, will use an identity 
link function and normally distributed errors within the generalized linear model s. For tertiary 
adverse clinical outcomes  and resource utilization outcomes , we will use a log link function and 
binary distributed errors  within the overall multivariable models . These models generate the 
estimated relative risks (RRs) with robust standard errors and are considered to be particularly 
appropriate when outcomes are common (e.g., incidences of ≥10%). For these  outcomes from 
claims data, we will follow patients whose  providers are randomized to the study from the time 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022  
Trial Protocol  
30 
 of randomization until they are censored due to lose of continuous enrollment in their health 
plan or leaving Atrius  Health . Due to the nature of the randomization, we do not anticipate any 
systematic di fferences in the amount of follow -up time per arm but will account for any 
imbalances using inverse probability censoring weights.  
Because this is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are planned as unadjusted; 
however, if there are strong patient -level predictors of the outcomes not balanced by [CONTACT_96237], we will adjust for these in the primary analyses. Given the nature of the data 
and how the outcomes are being measured, there should not be missing values. However, 
should there be suf ficient missing data (e.g., >10%), we will use multiple imputation.31   
 
7.3.3 Baseline descriptive analyses  
 
We will report the means and frequencies of pre-randomization variables separately for 
intervention and control subjects.  Comparisons of these values will be performed using t -tests 
and chi square tests and their non- parametric analogs, as appropriate. The outcomes will be 
evaluated using intention -to-treat principles among all randomized patients.  
 
 
7.3.4 Subgroup analyses  
 
In subgroup analyses, we will explore whether there were any modifiers of the effects of 
the EHR tools. For example, we will explore if certain types of providers (e.g., by [CONTACT_821658]) 
were more likely to respond to the EHR tools or if there were observable differences in patients 
who were less likely to receive inappropriate medications, such as gender or race/ethnicity.  
 
7.3.5 Exploratory analyses  
 
In secondary analyses, we will control for potential confounders which will be measured 
using EHR data from structured fields and administrative claims data. These variables will include provid er characteristics (such as s pecialty, age, and gender), patient characteris tics 
(such as major comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and age), and practice characteristics (such as practice size).  
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138963] by [CONTACT_54852] (Drs. Choudhry and 
Lauffenburger) will occur throughout the study period, including regular contact [CONTACT_722330]. In addition, 
this protocol will undergo Institutional Review Board (IRB) evaluation by a centralized IRB for this multi -site clinical trial. Study data will be accessible at all times for the principal 
investigators (Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger) and co -investigators to review, if applicable. 
The principal investigators will review study conduct (e.g., protocol deviations) on a monthly basis. The principal investigators will also ensure that all protocol deviations for the trials are reported to the NIH and the IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 We believe that the risks to participation for both sets of subjects (i.e. providers and 
patients) are no more than minimal for several reasons.  
 First, the intervention aims to emphasi ze guideline -recommended information for 
providers to assist in their decision- making when caring for older patients. Second, all 
treatment decisions will ultimately be made by [CONTACT_39516]. Finally, the 
intervention is specifically provi der-focused and delivered in an electronic health record system 
using information already available to providers. We believe there is no more than minimal risk 
involved to the provider subjects, as the providers will simply be “nudged” to alter their 
behav iors towards guideline recommended care, as opposed to being forced to do so. All 
medical decisions are ultimately made by [CONTACT_13917] . This trial will not interfere with the 
ordinary workings of the outpatient centers.  
There is a small risk associated with altering medication prescribing behaviors, 
including allergic reactions or other adverse medication effects; however , these risks are n o 
more than are encountered during routine clinical care and are less than patients would 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138964] for their patient; the prescribing 
changes in the EHR tools are simply suggestions, not rigid rules for the providers.  In addition, 
as described above, in the unexpected situation in w hich the EHR tools lead to worse 
prescribing decisions, we will discontinue those arms at the end of Stage  1. 
The primary risk to patients will be privacy of health information. We will minimize the 
risk to privacy by [CONTACT_722331]. Clinical 
data on the care for patients will be retrieved from the electronic medical records and insurer 
administrative claims. The data extracts obtained from the electronic medical record are 
continuously used by [CONTACT_821659], 
and undergo routine, rigorous peer -review by [CONTACT_821660]. Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger will work with the research project staff to ensure the accuracy of these data throughout the study period. For the purpose of conducting 
analyses of the study outcomes, this will involve creating scrambled patient and provider 
identifiers and sharing only limited Protected Health Information (PHI) with investigators for the purposes of analysis. The link between the identifiers and the medical record number will remain at Atrius Health in a password protected file. All team members have received appropriate training in data privacy.  
 
8.2 I nformed consent  
We will enroll provider -subjects based on their being employed by [CONTACT_821661]  
(adaptive trial) or Mass General Brigham  (replication trial) as an outpatient primary care 
provider . As with other minimal -risk, quality improvement studies we have performed that 
involve electronic alerts to providers, formal informed consent will not be sought. First, the 
nature of this quality improvement intervention involves testing EHR decision support directly 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August 2 2, 2022 
Trial Protocol  
33 
 for providers (using information already available to them and a similar infrastructure they use 
in the course of regular clinical care). Second, the ability to understand the true effect of the 
intervention as it is delivered in the real world would be difficult to ascertain if true informed 
consent was sought. Third, obtaining true informed consent would predictably reduce the 
number of patients participating in the study, especially those from unrepresented populations, 
and therefore undermi ne the generalizability of the study results, a foundational aspect of 
pragmatic clinical trial principles. Fourth, t his approach has been  approved by [CONTACT_821662]. In our prior work at these institutions, we have received  a 
waiver of informed consent from the IRBs of these organizations for similar interventions. We 
also request a HIPAA waiver of patient authorization to access the administrative claims and 
EHR data necessary for outcome evaluation, as doing so would be im practical and infeasible to 
conduct the study.  
While providers and patients will not be consented into the study, an organization -wide 
announcement will be circulated across Atrius to inform providers of the launch of an 
intervention leveraging clinical de cision support tools to support improved prescribing for older 
adults.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1138965] of pharmacy and medical claims, laboratory information, and structured information from the EHR. The only PHI that will be shared with the study investigators are dates (e.g., date of birth, admission/discharge dates, and dates of medication fills ), zip code, and Medicare

Trial Protocol  
34 
 Beneficiary  Identifier (MBI), which is necessary in order to access the Medicare administrative 
claims data for the outcome evaluation. Sharing this information will be necessary to assess 
the impact of the interventions.  
We have a history of collaborative evaluations between these organizations and BWH 
that involves transfer of the minimum data necessary to complete rigorous evaluations, 
involving the use of encrypted identifiers to ensure patient confidentiality.  The electronic data 
stored at  Atrius will be safeguarded by [CONTACT_54443] -of-the-art security protocols. The facilities have 
24-hour security and are protected by [CONTACT_821663]. Both health systems have computer 
networks in place that employ up to date virus protection software and enable password-
protected access only to study investigators. All data transfer s between the organizations will 
be accomplished using secure file transfer protocols.  To ensure the confidentiality and security 
of all data, the research team operates a secure, stat e-of-the-art computing facility housed at 
Partners Healthcare’s data center. The MGB  data center is a secure facility that houses both 
computing environments as well as clinical systems and electronic medical records for several 
large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39481]. Entry into the computer room requires staffed 
computer room security. The Division’s computers are connected to the MGB  networking 
backbone with 10 gigabit -per-second fiber links. Network security is overseen by [CONTACT_821664]’s data. All data are transmitted to programmers’ 
workstations in an encrypted state. Backups are created using the current Department of Defense standard for data security  and are stored in a locked facility. The redund ancy, 
extensive data power, and security of our computer facility confirm our capacity to collect and 
manage data and ensure confidentiality for all project participants.  
As described, all members of the research team have completed or will complete 
appro priate human subjects research training and patient privacy training related to the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The setup for analysis of these HIPAA -
limited data will be exactly the same as all of the other IRB applications that our MGB  research 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138966] with the Partners IRB for using these types of HIPAA -limited data. All of the datasets, 
including limited PHI, will be stored only on s ecure servers at MGB  Healthcare’s data center 
and will only be accessed by a limited number of individuals in the study team from this division 
who are all trained in data security and patient privacy.

Monitoring Board (DSMB) for all aspects of this research. We will also establish an 
independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) with experience in quality of care, 
patient safety, and biostatistics. The DSMB will act in an advisory capacity to monitor 
participant safety and evaluate the progress of the study, review procedures and management 
of the study. As previously described above, Atrius Health does not have its own IRB and cedes review to MGB’s  IRB. The DSMB reports will be shared with the local site PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_1138968] 
with clinical leadership to obtain any feedback from clinicians regarding the studies. 
Compliance of regulatory documents and study data accuracy and completeness will be maintained through an internal study team quality  assurance process.  At each meeting, the 
DSMB  will make re commendations as to whether the studies  should continue or if changes to 
the protocol are necessary for continuation.  This trial will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.

 8.5 Benefit risk assessment  
8.5.1 Known potential risks  
There is a small risk associated with altering medication prescribing behaviors, including 
allergic reactions or other adverse medication effects; however , these risks are no more than are 
encountered during routine clinical care. In addition, these risks will be minimized in our protocol as 
we are relying on the provider to prescribe as they see best for their patient; the prescribing 
changes in the EHR tools are simply suggestions, not rigid rules for the providers.  In the 
intervention arms, providers will be encouraged to follow national guidelines in the care of their 
patients and discontinue dangerous medications. It is recommended that some of these medications (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], sedative hypnotics) be discontinued through a gradual dose taper 
so as to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and suggested tapers will be provided as a solution within the 
EHR prompts.  Another potential small risk to patients will be pri vacy of health information. We will 
minimize the risk to privacy by [CONTACT_722331]. Clinical data on the care for patients will be retrieved from the electronic medical 
records and insurer administrative claims at Atrius Health.  
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_1138969] prescribing tools for providers 
caring for older adults. Potential benefits for participants in this study include improved decision 
support tools and guideline- concordant prescribing. The human subjects may benefit from 
discontinuing a dangerous drug that is not recommended for them. Additionally, the subjects 
and society may benefit in the future from accumulated knowledge that originat es from this 
research. We will also produce several EHR tool deliverables for this work for the public, 
researchers, and policymakers, which will be shared as generalized knowledge.   
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.10 – August [ADDRESS_1138970] system using information already available to providers. 
We believe there is no more than minimal risk involved to the provider subjects, as the providers 
will simply be “nudged” to alter their behaviors towards guideline recommended care, as opposed to being forced to do so. All medical decisions are ultimately made by [CONTACT_13917]. This trial will not interfere with the ordinary workings of the outpatient centers.   
The potential societal benefits outweigh the minimal risk, especially in light of multiple 
measures in place to protect confidentiality.  The data extracts obtained from the electronic medical 
record and these claims are continuously used by [CONTACT_821665], and undergo routine, rigorous peer -review by [CONTACT_821666].  For the purpose of conducting analyses of the 
study outcomes, this will involve creating scrambled patient and pr ovider identifiers and sharing 
only limited Protected Health Information (PHI) with investigators for the purposes of analysis.  Because our intervention encourages providers to discontinue dangerous medications in 
a way that prioritized patient safety and enables the provider to retain full decision- making power of 
the care of the patient, there is no more than minimal risk involved for our patient and physician-
subjects.

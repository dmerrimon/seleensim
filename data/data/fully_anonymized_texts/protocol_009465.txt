ABSTRACT  
Olfactory dysfunction affects approximately 15% of the adult population a nd significantly impacts quality of life. 
Current available treatments include systemic corticosteroids, intranasal corticosteroids, and olfactory training, 
with limited evidence of efficacy. In vitro and in vivo  studies have demonstrated the crucial role of elevated 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in olfactory 
signaling and sensory axonal regeneration. Theophylline, a medication commonly used to treat asthma,  
inhibits phosphodiesterase, thereby [CONTACT_206737]. This effect on key messengers 
provides a possible mechanistic explanation for theophylline’s role in the treatment of olfactory dysfunction. 
Therefore, we propose a single -site, double -blinded, placebo -controlled randomized clinical trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of intranasal theophylline irrigation on subjective and objective olfaction outcomes in [ADDRESS_246590]. Dorina Kallog jeri, will use a randomized block design 
for study drug assignment will use a randomized block design for study drug assignment. The randomization 
scheme will be a 1:[ADDRESS_246591] that theophylline added to nasal saline lavage improves olfactory dysfunction, then a larger phase III 
randomized controlled trial based on the results from this stu dy can be designed.  
 
1.4 Research Question & Study Aims  
AIM 1 : Evaluate the efficacy of intranasal theophylline delivered via high -volume, low -pressure nasal 
saline irrigation on olfactory recovery in patients with post -viral olfactory dysfunction.  
Partici pants will be randomized to [ADDRESS_246592] (UPSIT) scores . Compared to nasal saline irrigation alone, we hypothesize that intranasal 
theophylline irrigation will be more effective in improving olfactory recovery.  
 
AIM 2: Describe adverse effects related to theophylline nasal saline irrigation.  
All participants will be monitored for adverse effects throughout the study. A subset of participants will undergo 
serum theophylline measurements to assess the level of systemic  absorption, if any. Based on prior studies 
which failed to demonstrate detectable serum theophylline levels after intranasal spray, we hypothesize that 
intranasal theophylline irrigation will have minimal systemic absorption and adverse effects.  
 
Backgrou nd & Significance  
Olfactory dysfunction is a very prevalent condition affecting 15% of all American adults and 25% of 
adults older than 53 years of age.1,2 Commonly, afflicted individuals describe impairments in food preparation 
and diet, weight changes, concerns over environmental safety, poor personal hygiene, impaired interpersonal 
relationships, and social withdrawal, even comparing it to “living a life without color” or “living in a plastic bag”.[ADDRESS_246593] -viral, inflammatory such as in chronic 
rhinosinusitis (CRS), traumatic, neurodegenerative such as in Parkinson’s disease, and idiopathic.[ADDRESS_246594] -viral olfactory dysfunction  is characterized by [CONTACT_206738][INVESTIGATOR_206728] 40% of patients with olfactory dysfunction, making it 
one of the most common causes of impaired olfaction.[ADDRESS_246595] some degree of spontaneous olfactory recovery, but recovery is often incomplete.8,9 Other 
studies revealed lower spontaneous olfactory improvement rates of 18% in this patient population after [ADDRESS_246596] low quality of e vidence and lack an appropriate control 
group.12-15 The one randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with post -traumatic anosmia that compared a 
group treated with oral prednisolone versus a control group receiving no treatment demonstrated no significant 
differences in recovery rates of olfactory function.[ADDRESS_246597] (level 1B evidence), on topi[INVESTIGATOR_206729] d ifferences in olfaction outcomes pre - and post -intervention.16,[ADDRESS_246598] on olfaction (level 1B evidence) while 
systemic corticosteroids may improve olfactory loss (level 4 evidence).[ADDRESS_246599] investigated the 
importance of cAMP and cGMP as 
secon dary messengers in olfactory 
responses . Olfactory neuronal dendrites are 
highly enriched with adenylate cyclase and 
guanylate cyclase, which convert adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP and guanosine 
triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP, respectively 
(Figure 1).22-[ADDRESS_246600] of myelin and 
myelin -associated glycoprotein (MAG) likely related to the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_206730], which never recovers.[ADDRESS_246601] similar effects in other sensory neurons, such as those involv ed in olfaction. Henkin and Velicu 
discovered that cAMP and cGMP levels in nasal mucus were significantly lower in hyposmic patients 
compared to normosmic controls.29 Furthermore, a stepwise increase in olfactory dysfunction was 

associated with a stepwise decrease in nasal mucus cAMP and cGMP levels , thereby [CONTACT_206739].30  
Since phosphodieste rases (PDE) break down cAMP and cGMP into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) 
and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), respectively, investigators have studied the use of PDE inhibitors to 
improve olfaction. Theophylline , an inexpensive and widely available treatment for asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a non-selective PDE inhibitor , thereby [CONTACT_206740], smooth muscle relaxation, and decreased 
inflammation downstream (F igure 1).24 Its anti-inflammatory properties  may also be mediated by [CONTACT_206741] -κB (NF -κB), a pro -inflammato ry transcription factor, into the 
nucleus.[ADDRESS_246602] in a single -arm longitudinal study of oral theophylline  treatment on hyposmic patients, 50% 
(157/312)  reported subjective improvement in smell with 11% (34/312) reporting return of normal smell 
function.[ADDRESS_246603] also been associated with significant increases in brain activation signal in 
response to odors on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).33 Some patients only responded to 
theophylline in a dose -dependent manner, requiring further escalation of dosing and prolonged treatment 
duration, thereby [CONTACT_206742], nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, 
tachycardia, a bdominal discomfort, and restlessness.24,32 
Due to systemic theophylline’s relatively narrow th erapeutic index and desire for improved therapeutic 
efficacy, topi[INVESTIGATOR_206731]. The same investigators from the single -
arm oral theophylline study conducted a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_206732] 10 patients who 
had submaximal responses to prior oral theophylline treatment.34 Eight of these ten patients reported 
subjective improvement in smell function after intranasal theophylline, and there was a mean 28% increase in 
quantitative su bjective scores  compared to 14% after oral theophylline, which was a statistically significant 
difference. Objective testing via olfactometry revealed significant improvements in detection and recognition 
thresholds  for [ADDRESS_246604] detailed a study of 8 patients with chronic anosmia and hyposmia also treated with 
intranasal theophylline spray, of whom 4 of 8 had improvement on subjective and/or objective testing via the 
Monell -Jefferson Taste and Smell Questionnaire and UPSIT, respectively.35 Interestingly, these participants’ 
response to prednisone did not predict response to intranasal theophylline, offering a promising treatment 
modality to patients with olfactory loss refractory to corticosteroid treatment.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_206733], it is difficult 
interpreting the clinical significance of intranasal theophylline from the data due to the heterogeneity of the 
study populations, non -standard measurement modalities of olfa ction, and lack of a control group.34,35 Both 
studies included patients with olfactory dysfunction of multiple etiologies. Henkin et al.’s study population may 
also represent a relatively refractory group since al l participants previously either had suboptimal responses to 
oral theophylline or could not tolerate its course, thereby [CONTACT_206743]. Additionally in Henkin et al.’s 
studies on oral and intranasal theophylline, an increase of 5 points on the 100-point scale for quantitative 
subjective smell change was considered clinically significant without sufficient explanation of that 
determination.32,34 Furthermore, Goldstein et al.’s study was limited to an abstract, which categorized people as 
complete responders if they  improved on both subjective and objective testing and partial responders if they 
only improved on one without detailing effect sizes or measures of clinically significant change.35 A discussion 
between the PI (Lee) and [CONTACT_206753], a rhinologist at the University of Washington who was a panelist at 
the New & Improved Treatment Options for Olfactory Loss session at the AAO -HNS 20 18 Meeting (Atlanta, 
GA), confirmed the above concerns, thereby [CONTACT_206744] 50% response rate into question.  
 While topi[INVESTIGATOR_206734], there is no literature utilizing 
delivery via nasal saline irrigation . Various additives, including corticosteroids and antibiotics, to irrigation 
devices are gaining popularity as a result of improved distribution of the medication throughout the nasal cavity 
and paranasal sinuses.36 We believe the large -volume, low -pressure nasal saline irr igation delivery system will 
result in better penetration of the middle meatus and olfactory cleft  than nasal spray.

Recruitment and Consent Process  
 Adult patients with reported smell loss after an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (URI) with duration between 6 
to 36 months will be recruited from the clinics of the Washington University School of Medicine. Attending 
physicians from both the Departments of Ot olaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery and other departments such 
as Internal Medicine will be informed of the study.  
 Eligible patients who present to clinic will be approached by a research team member to review the 
informed consent process and thoroughly d iscuss the research protocol, potential benefits, and risks of the 
study with the patient and any available family members in person. Any subsequent questions or concerns 
from the potential participant and any family members will also be addressed at that time. After discussion, the 
patient will be asked to re -summarize the steps involved in the study to ensure understanding. If interested, 
written consent may be obtained during that visit. Patients will be reminded that study participation is voluntary 
and will in no way affect their current or future care.  
  
 
Study Procedures  
This study will be a single -site, double -blinded, placebo -controlled randomized clinical trial performed at a 
tertiary academic medical center. The proposed study flow diagram is show n in Figure 2.  
Aim 1 : Evaluate the impact  of intranasal theophylline delivered via high -volume, low -pressure nasal 
saline irrigation on olfactory recovery in patients with post -viral olfactory dysfunction.  
We hypothesize that intranasal theophylline irrigation will be more effective in improving olfactory 
recovery compared to nasal saline irrigation alone. After enrollment, all patients will undergo anterior 
rhinoscopy at the initial visit to rule out polyps . Enrolled subjects will then undergo baseline olfactory testing 
using:  
 
 
Fig. 2 . Proposed study flow.  
 
1) Global Rating of Smell 
Dysfunction . This baseline global rating is 
adapted from the Clinical Global Impressions -
Severity scale  to address smell.37 It measures 
the severity of baseline smell loss by [CONTACT_7939]: 
“Overall, please rate your current sense of 
smell. Response options: Excellent, Very good, 
Good, Fair , Poor , or Absent. ” 
2) Modified Questionnaire of 
Olfactory Disorders . A 42 -item questionnaire, 
which includes negative statements, positive 
statements, sincerity statements, and parosmia 
statements to evaluate quality of life (QOL) related to olfactory dysfunction.  
3) Veterans RAND 12 (VR -12) Emotional Health Survey . The VR -12 is a widely establishe d 12-item 
questionnaire that evaluates physical and emotional health status. The seven questions pertaining to emotional 
health will be utilized.  
4) University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT , Sensonics, New Jersey ). The 
UPSIT  is a validat ed [ADDRESS_246605] where microencapsulated odorants on a 
strip are released by [CONTACT_117891].38,39 Out of a total of 40 points, normosmia is defined as ≥34 for males and ≥35 
for fema les, and an increase in ≥4 points is considered a clinically significant improvement.38  
All enrolled participants will then undergo simple randomization to receive 6 weeks of either 
theophylline 12 mg capsules  or identical -appearing placebo lactose capsules . We determined the 
theophylline dose to be 12 mg based on the literature by [CONTACT_147572] a ratio using the same concentration of 20 
mcg/0.4 mL that was utilized in the nasal spray.34,35 Using equivalent ratios, 20 mcg / 0.4 mL  = X / 240 mL,  so 
X = 12,000 mcg = 12 mg dissolved in 240 mL of nasal saline.    
The use of theophylline  in a nasal saline rinse is a change in the approved route of administration. An 
exemption from IND requirements is requested as the proposed use of theophylline  in this study fulfills all  of 
the criteria for exemption:  
1. Theophy lline is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002].  
2.  This study is not intended to be reported to the FDA in support of a new indication or  
significant change in labeling.  
3. This study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising fo r the  
drug.  
4. The study does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other  
factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk)  
associated with the use of theophylline.  
5. The study will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717]  
(21 CF R part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).  
6. The study is not intended to promote or commercialize theophylline . 
 
The placebo product will contain lactose monohydrate and will be supplied in clear plastic capsules, 
which are identical to the theophylline  capsules.  The lactose capsule will only contain lactose as there are no 
other ingredients.  
Participants will disso lve the contents of either the theophylline or lactose capsules into the sinus rinse 
bottle containing nasal saline.  All participants will receive an 8 -ounce sinus rinse bottle and a 6 -week supply of 
USP Grade Sodium Chloride & Sodium Bicarbonate Mixture (pH balanced, Isotonic & Preservative & Iodine 
Free) commercially prepared packets. Participants will either need to p urchase distilled water or boil tap water 
for five minutes for use with the saline irrigation.  A member of the research team will instruct participants on 
how to irrigate each nasal cavity with one -half of the contents of the sinus rinse bottle. Written in structions and 
a video demonstration will also be provided to ensure proper technique. Because the half -life of theophylline in 
healthy adults (16 -60 years) is 8.7 hours and 9.8 h ours in the elderly (> 60 year), irrigations will be performed 
twice daily  – once in the morning and once at night for all subjects.40 
The primary outcome  will be the self -reported Global Rating o f Smell Change on a 7 -point Likert 
scale, which asks, “ Overall, how would you rate your change in smell after your 6 weeks of irrigations? 

Response options: Much better, Somewhat better, Slightly better, Neither better nor worse, Slightly worse, 
Somewhat worse , or Much worse .” Subjects that report a change of slightly better or more will be defined as 
responders to treatment. Efficacy will be determined by [CONTACT_206745]. Secondary outcomes  will be within - and between -subject changes in UPSIT  scores  from 
baseline to post -intervention.  
 
Aim #2 : Describe any adverse effects related to theophylline nasal saline irrigation.  
We hypothesize that systemic absorption of theophylline delivered via nasal saline irrigation will be 
minimal, and thus, there will be mini mal adverse effects. One study on intranasal theophylline spray measured 
serum theophylline levels in [ADDRESS_246606] to plasma protein binding, which renders it  bio-inactive, reducing the potential for adverse effects. 
Approximately 40% of theophylline is bound to plasma proteins after entering systemic circulation.[ADDRESS_246607] -pass elimination, therefore 
approaching 100% of the available drug.43 
Another factor to account for  is the volume of nas al irrigation that will remain in the sinus cavity. In 
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo nasal saline irrigation with a 240 mL  sinus rinse bottle , up to 
5% of the sol ution remains in the sinuses.44 Therefore, the maximum  amount of fluid le ft in the sinuses after a 
240 mL  nasal irrigation is  estimated to be  12 m L. Applying this data , the maximum absorption of 12 mg of 
theophylline added to a 240 m L saline filled rinse  bottle for irrigation  may be estimated by [CONTACT_147572] 12 mg / 
240 mL = 0.05 mg/mL or 50 mcg/mL. Since the maximum volume that is estimated to be retained in th e 
sinuses is 12 mL, 12 mL x 50 mcg/mL = 600 mcg per dose. For twice daily dosing, the total daily dose is 
1200 mcg or 1.2 mg.  
On average 1 mg/kg of theophylline results in blood levels rising 2 mcg/mL.45 Therapeutic effects of 
theophylline occur at a se rum concentration of 5 -20 mcg/mL.46 Unwanted side  effects , such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and tachycardia,  occur when  plasma levels exceed 20 mcg/mL.[ADDRESS_246608] 
emergency department, his/her primary care provider, or the Otolaryngology -Head & Neck Surgery clinic, 
depending on severity of the adverse effect.  
 
Potential Benefits  
 The potential benefit to the participant is improvement of their smell and taste u sing this novel therapy. 
The potential benefit to the society is the use of the results to initiate a large phase III study to definitively 
determine efficacy of intranasal theophylline use for treatment of post -viral olfactory dysfunction so that 
intranas al theophylline may become a mainstay treatment of this disease which currently has no effective 
treatment.  
 
Analysis Methods  
An intention -to-treat analysis will be used where all participants will be examined in the groups to which 
they were initially assigned regardless of the treatment actually received. Standard  descriptive statistics will be 
used to assess  the demographics, clinical characteristics, and olfactory test results of the study population. 
The difference in rate of responders between the two groups will estimate the effect size of the primary 
outcome measure, and the 95% CI around that point estimate will measure precision. In each group, the 
frequency and relative frequency of the participants’ response to the global rating of smell chang e will be 
reported for each Likert category. Fisher’s exact test will be used for comparing the responders’ rates between 
the [ADDRESS_246609] sizes with 95% CIs  will be reported for each 
analysis. All statistical analyses will be conducted in SPSS 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).  
 
Rationale or Power Analysis  
To date, there is no study that explores the effect of theophylline in post -viral olfactory dysfunction 
alone, and among the [ADDRESS_246610] a 50% response rate after 4 weeks of intranasal theophylline treatment,32,34,35 we believe that 50% is 
overly optimistic from our discussion with [CONTACT_206753], who prescribes nasal theophylline spray in his 
clinical prac tice and estimates a more realistic response rate of 25%.  
Thus, unlike a traditional sample size and power calculation, we will instead utilize a fixed sample size 
based on feasibility. At our institution, an annual average of 172 patients  presented with ICD -10 code R43 
(Disturbances of smell & taste), and our two full -time rhinologists report seeing a total of [ADDRESS_246611]. Jiramongkolchai’s recruitment rate for CORE grant #575133  (see Preliminary Studies), 
a realistic estimate for enrollment within a 12 -month period is 40 participants . With an anticipated 20% drop -
out and withdrawal rate, we estimate 32 participants  – 16 in each arm – will complete the study. Based on the 
sample size of 32, we calculated a range of possible effect sizes defined as the difference in rate of responders 
between the two groups and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed two  placebo response rates of 6.25% 
(1/16) and 12.5% (2/16) and a reasonable range of intranasal theophylline response rates from 18.75% (4/16) 
to 50.0% (8/16) (Table 1).

Assessment of Treatment Safety  
 In our study, the first [ADDRESS_246612] every 6 months.  All reports of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or an 
Unexpected Adverse Event will be inves tigated by [CONTACT_206746].   
 
 
Participant Remuneration  
Every participant will receive $4 0 after the initial visit and $40 at the completion of the 6 -week study for 
a total of $[ADDRESS_246613] ten patients that undergo phlebotomy for serum theophylline measurement at the end of 
the study period will receive an additional $40 for a total of $120. Parking vouchers will also be provided at 
each visit.  
 
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants, Conf identiality and Data 
Management  
Procedures that are in place to curb risks of breaches in confidentiality and patient privacy are 1) formal 
training protocols centered on the maintenance of confidentiality for all study team members; 2) de -identified 
databases using only the study ID numbers assigned by [CONTACT_23164]; 3) a password -protected 
computer file of a master list that contains the identity of subjects, corresponding ID numbers, and contact 
[CONTACT_206747]; and 4) a locked cabinet to store identified data forms such as completed 
questionnaires and UPSIT exams.  
Only members of the study team will have access to the computer file and password for the master list. 
All research data files will be stored on secure Wa shington University servers with computer, network, and 
database -level passwords that will only be accessible to study team members. A key to the locked cabinet 
containing identified data forms will also only be available to study team members. Accordingly , these 
mechanisms intend to limit access to information that can link clinical data to individual subjects. No subject 
identifying information will be revealed in any publications or presentations.  
A member of the study team will be available by [CONTACT_206748] 24 hours a day for 7 days a week to 
respond to any concerns or address any adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_206749].

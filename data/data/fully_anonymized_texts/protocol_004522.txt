Study  Purpose  The purpose  of this clinical  investigation  is to evaluate  the precision and  
accuracy  of the Senseonics  Continuous Glucose  Monitoring System  
(Senseonics  CGM  System)  measurements  when  compared  with reference 
standard measurements. Compression of the sensor site and use of a new 
algorithm will also be evaluated.  The investigation will also evaluate  
safety  of the Senseonics  CGM  System  usage.  
 
 
 
Target  
Indication for 
Use The Senseonics  CGM  System  is a glucose  monitoring  device  intended  to 
continually  measure  interstitial fluid glucose  levels  in individuals  with  
diabetes  for the operating  life of the sensor.  The Senseonics  CGM  
System  is intended to be used: 
• To provide  real-time  glucose  readings directly  to the user.  
• To provide glucose  trend information.  
• To provide alerts  for the detection and prediction of epi[INVESTIGATOR_305475]  (hypoglycemia)  and high  blood  glucose  
(hyperglycemia).  
 
Study  Design  
Summary  This is a non-randomized,  prospective,  single -arm,  multi -center  study,  
enrolling    adult subjects  with diabetes mellitus  in the United  States at 
up to [ADDRESS_373807]  one or two 
Sensors  inserted in the upper  arms  by [CONTACT_305517].  The 
accuracy  of the system  will be evaluated  during  clinic  visits,  comparing  
Sensor  glucose  with laboratory reference  values.  For qualifying 
subjects, during  the clinic  visits,  there are planned hyperglycemia and  
hypoglycemia  challenges,  as described  in protocol Section  5.     All 
diabetes care  decisions will be based  on   plasma glucose  values,  rather 
than System  CGM  results.

In spi[INVESTIGATOR_305482],  diabetes  mellitus  continues  to be a difficult 
medical condition to treat.  The challenge  remains  to achieve  desired  glycemic  control  and to 
prevent both the short- term  consequences  (severe hypoglycemia and DKA)  and long -term  
complications  (retinopathy,  neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular problems).   The 
monitoring  of blood  glucose by [CONTACT_305524]-care.  The current standard glucose  monitoring  regimen  for patients  with diabetes  involves  
using  a small portable meter  to obtain a capi[INVESTIGATOR_305483]  a day.  According  to the International Society of Pediatric  and Adolescent Diabetes  
(ISPAD),  “successful  application  of intensified diabetes  management  with  multiple  injection  
therapy or insulin  infusion therapy  requires  frequent self-monitoring  of blood  glucose  (four to  
six times  a day)  and regular,  frequent review  of the results  to identify  patterns  requiring  
adjustment to the diabetes  treatment plan.”1    Despi[INVESTIGATOR_305484], due to the nature of diabetes  glucose values  may  fluctuate widely 
throughout the day.  In addition, as the BG meter  value  shows only  a point in time  glucose 
level,  even  patients  who monitor  frequently, may  miss  significant hypoglycemic and 
hyperglycemic  excursions.  Continuous  glucose  monitoring (CGM),  which measures  interstitial  
glucose  levels , has been  developed  recently and has been  shown to be associated  with 
improved  glycemic control  in adults  with type  1 diabetes.  Current commercially  available  CGM  
devices  require the  repeated, frequent insertion  of a sensor  by [CONTACT_8130].

[LOCATION_003],  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a new CGM  System    intended for measuring  interstitial fluid glucose  levels  
in adults  with diabetes  mellitus.   The Senseonics  CGM  System measures  interstitial fluid 
glucose  levels  continuously  and is implanted under  the skin by a trained  clinician.  Unlike  
commercially available  transcutaneous  continuous  glucose monitoring  devices  with  short  
operating  lives  (up to 7 days),  the Senseonics  Sensor  is intended to  be inserted 
subcutaneously  with no sensor  part protruding  from the skin,  and the operating  life is 
intended to be up to 90 days  or until  the end of life  indicator  is reached.  
This clinical trial is being  carried  out to assess the safety  and efficacy of the Senseonics  CGM  
System.  It is intended that the results  of this study will  support  the targeted indication  as 
described  in Section  1.1 below, providing  quantification of accuracy and  demonstrate safety  
in clinic  and home  use settings  over  the operating  life of the Sensor.

1.1.1 Description  
The Senseonics  CGM  Sensor  uses a selective,  fully  reversible  binding  between  glucose and  a 
unique  fluorescent indicator  macromolecule that  is grafted  on the surface of  the Sensor.  
The fundamental  recognition  reaction  is a reversible  condensation of the cis-diol groups  of 
glucose  with the bis -boronate moiety of an indicator.  Glucose binding  by [CONTACT_305525].  Glucose  signal  transduction 
is accomplished  by [CONTACT_305526]’s  
optical  system.  
The Senseonics  System  Transmitter powers  the Sensor  and receives  signals  from  the 
Sensor  across  the skin.   The Sensor  does  not contain a battery or other  stored  power  
source; instead it is powered discretely,  as needed, by a simple inductive magnetic  link 
between the Transmitter and Sensor.  Signals  carrying  glucose concentration data  are 
superimposed upon the magnetic  power  link between the two components.  This results  
in “passive”  telemetry,  rather  than an “active” radio  frequency  (RF) transmission,  
between the Sensor  and Transmitter.  Between  readings,  the Sensor  remains  electrically 
dormant  and fully  powered down.  At each  query (automatically  set for approximately  
every five minutes, with  a duration of approximately  100 milliseconds),  the Transmitter 
sends  power  (via magnetic  link)  to activate  the sensor, and then uses  this same  magnetic  
link to capture the  reading.  Finally,  the Transmitter calculates  and stores  the measured 
glucose value for  transmission  to the Mobile Medical  Application.  
Components  of the Senseonics  CGM  System  are traced  by [CONTACT_305527]/or  lot 
number.  The Sensor,  Sensor  holder, insertion  tool, and blunt  dissector  are provided sterile.  
Sterilized  components  also have  an expi[INVESTIGATOR_78288].  The device is labeled  in compliance 
with regulatory  language  requirements  identifying  it as investigational.  The Instructions  for 
Use are provided  with each shipment.  
Insertion  of the Sensor  is a minimally  invasive  procedure  and clinical investigators 
representing the intended use population (Endocrinologists, Internists, General and Family 
Practitioners)  will be appropriately  trained  in the procedure  prior to insertion  or removal 
of the Sensor. Training and qualifications of investigators will be documented.  
 
Transmitters  will be provided for single -subject use in this clinical trial.  
1.1.2 Calibration  
The primary Senseonics CGM System will be calibrated  by [CONTACT_305528],  using the study -provided, commercially  available  BG Meter 
(Subject SMBG Meter),  according  to the SMBG meter  manufacturer  instructions.  The 
Senseonics, Inc.  Confidential Information  Page 18 of 99 
Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  29 Sep. 2017 29 Sep 2017   calibration  process  automatically  moves  through three  phases: Warm Up, Initialization,  and 
Daily Calibration:  
 
• Warm Up is the first 24 hours  after  Sensor  insertion.  During this period, Glucose 
information  is not calculated.  No calibration  is performed.  
• Initialization  can be performed  a minimum of 24 hours  after  Sensor  insertion.  Following  
the Warm Up phase, the entering  of four successful  calibration  BG readings  within 24 
hours  is required  for successful  completion  of Initialization.  Glucose information  will 
begin to be calculated   after  the second  calibration  is entered  successfully.  
• Daily  Calibration  requires  [ADDRESS_373823]  been  conducted on the Senseonics  CGM  System to 
characterize  performance,  evaluate  biocompatibility  and demonstrate  proof  of principle  in 
primates.  Results  of these tests  are presented in the Report  of Prior Investigations.  
Clinical experience has included healthy volunteers and  people with  type  1 and 2 diabetes.  
As of February 2017 , the Senseonics  CGM System  has been  tested in two feasibility studies  
in the US. Other initiated Competent Authority/FDA and EC/IRB -approved feasibility studies 
include  studies in the [LOCATION_006] (Manchester), India (Mumbai, Pune), Romania (Bucharest Study I, II 
and III), Belgium (Brussels), South Africa (Cape Town), US (Set -Point Study), Canad a and 
Sweden (HOUSE). Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], PRECISE Study (in the EU) and PRECISE II Study (in the 
US) were also conducted. As of February 2017, a total  of [ADDRESS_373824]  been  inserted  
with 983 sensors with days  in-vivo totaling  102,665 days.   
These studies  demonstrated that the Senseonics  CGM System provided  reliable  interstitial 
fluid glucose  readings  for periods  of up to approximately  180 days  when compared  to 
laboratory  blood  glucose  analyzer measurements,  with no noted safety  issues.  Detailed 
presentation of methods  and results  for each investigation  are presented in the Report of 
Prior Investigations.

suspects improper performance of the meter.  
5.4.3 Ketone meter  
The study will supply and us e an FDA -approved self- monitoring ketone meter and strips 
(Abbott Precision Xtra or similar), which will measure β -hydroxybuty rate (β-HOB). Ketone 
meters will remain at the clinical site (not disbursed to the subject). Calibration of the ketone meter will be verified with the control solution(s) specific to the meter and strips. The tested 
control solutions must read within the established range on the strips per manufacturer 
labeling in order to be used in the study. Manufacturer instructions for operation and quality 
control will be followed.  
5.5 Senseonics Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System Calibration  
The  Senseonics  Continuous  Glucose  Monitoring (CGM)  System  will  be  calibrated  and  
maintained  per Eversense CGM User Guide. After the initialization period (approx. 30 hours

soap, warm water and a dry towel), or by [CONTACT_305538]. 
5.8 Ketones  
Ketone (β -hydroxybutyrate (β -HOB)) measurements will be made using a study supplied FDA -
approved self- monitoring ketone meter and strips  as described in 5.4.[ADDRESS_373882] blood 
ketones should be evaluated from capi[INVESTIGATOR_305493] (sampling) visits at the following times:  
• On arrival to and at discharge from the clinic  
• Glucose ≥300 mg/dL (measure approximately within [ADDRESS_373883] glucose 
reading >300 mg/dL and repeat approximately every 60 minutes until  < 300mg/dL)  
• Ketones  ≥0.6 mmol/L (repeat approximately every 60 minutes until < 0.6 mmol/L)  
• Subject has nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain regardless of glucose level.  
Treatment guidelines for ketones can be found in section 7.1. 5. 
5.9 IV/B lood Draw Guideline s 
5.9.1 IV Placement/S etup  
IVs for blood sampling may be placed in the arm or hand. IV Access will be maintained during 
the sampling portion of the study for blood sampling and for the treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia during the study. If an IV fails, a reasonable effort should be 
made to replace it.  
It is advised that sites use a heating pad in order to help keep IV sampling sites patent and 
improve blood flow.  
Sites will be advised to use a dual stopcock closed- loop or single stopcock blood -wasting 
technique, as long as site personnel are cognizant of the following:  
• The single -stopcock technique has a lower risk of diluted samples, but sites must take 
care not to exceed the protocol total blood loss limit of 475 ml in any 8 -week period.  
• Please note that when calculating waste volume to consider the volume of saline in the 
system that is drawn when clearing the line. This could include the extension set (0.2 ml), stopcock (0.2ml), and cannula (0.1 ml). Therefore a 1.5 ml “waste” draw actually con tains 
1.0 ml blood.

Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  29 Sep. 2017 29 Sep 2017   
5.9.2 Timing of blood sampling  
Blood will be sampled every 5 -15 minutes, dependent on the value of the previous sample 
according to the following ranges:  
• BG ≥ 3 25 mg/dL: every 5 minutes (+/ - 2 minutes)  
• BG >75 mg/dL and  < 3 25 mg/dL: every 15 minutes (+/ - 2 minutes)  
• BG  ≤75 mg/dL:  every 5 minutes (+/-  2 minutes)  
 
Additional samples may be drawn for YSI glucose analysis as needed for patient safety or to 
recheck a suspected erroneous value (e.g. dilute sample).  
In the event of l oss of IV access or loss of functional YSI and need for continued subject 
monitoring, glucose measurements will be made on capi[INVESTIGATOR_305494] . These values will not be included in the study data set, but will only 
be used for subject treatment decisions.  
Samples missed due to loss of IV access or loss of functional YSI will not be considered protocol deviations.  
5.9.3 Sample volume  
Approximately 1.0 ml IV blood samples will be collected (after saline is cleared from samp ling apparatus) in sample containers with an appropriate anticoagulant additive (BD 
Microtainer K2E tubes (REF 365955) or Sarstedt Monovette with K2E (REF 06.1664.001) or 
similar) for analysis.  
5.9.[ADDRESS_373884] asma, approximately 30 seconds in StatSpin 
Express 2 (or similar) centrifuge (8500 rpm).  
Samples centrifugation should begin as soon as possible after the blood draw (within a 
maximum of 3 minutes).   Spun samples should be prepared, as defined in the Study Operations Manual.  
*More detailed guidelines are included  in the Study Operations Manual . 
5.10 Sensor Replacement  
For subjects with one sensor (participating in the subset), if sensor failure is suspected, 
sensor will not be replaced.  
For subjects with two sensors, suspect failure of the primary s enso r (the sensor for  which 
calibrati on fingersticks are entered), the secondary sensor in the contralateral arm will 
become the prima ry sensor. Subjects will be instructed to replace the Gen 2  transmitter with

5.14 Discharge instructions  – Sensor accuracy visits  
The discharge procedure will occur upon completion of visit related activities. Blood glucose 
(either SMBG or YSI) and ketone measurements will be assessed. If the glucose level is<75 mg/dL or ≥300 mg/dL, corrective action will be taken by [CONTACT_305542]:  
Senseonics, Inc.  Confidential Information  Page 56 of 99 
Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  29 Sep. 2017 29 Sep 2017   • If plasma glucose is <75 mg/dL, carbohydrates or other medically necessary and 
appropriate interventions will be administered to raise the glucose to ≥75 mg/dL.  
• If plasma glucose is >300 mg/dL, fingerstick ketones will be checked and  the Inpatient 
Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment guidelines will be fo llowed.  
The subject will be discharged once plasma glucose is:  
• 100- 300 mg/dL and stable or rising in this range for [ADDRESS_373891] 15 minutes apart, and ketone is ≤0.6 mmol/L; or  
• >75- 100 mg/dL and rising for [ADDRESS_373892] 15 minutes 
apart, and ketone is ≤0.6 mmol/L.  
• Subjects should not be released if BG is <100 mg/dL and not rising.  
• Site will document any adverse events that may have occurred during the visit.  
*These measurements should be taken after approximately [ADDRESS_373893]’s insulin regimen for the remainder of the day to 
prevent post- visit rebound hypoglycemia which can occur 12 hours later.

• Insulin treatment for hyperglycemia or ketones should be done using the subject’s own 
insulin. In the event that the subject’s own insulin appears to be compromised (not having 
the expected  effect on the subject’s blood glucose), appropriate insulin (based on the 
subject’s normal insulin type and concentration) provided by [CONTACT_305551].  
If the ketone level is ≥1.5 mmol/L, the accuracy (sampling) visit will be stopped and the study 
MD or NP will take control of the subject's insulin dosing. The cause of the elevated ketone level 
will be investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). If the subject's home parameters are 
not felt to be working adequately due to hyperglycemia, ketonem ia, or other factors (e.g. 
intercurrent illness), the study MD or NP will administer corrective insulin either via insulin 
syringe or via a new pump site using an ISF determined to be appropriate for the setting and a goal glucose of 120 mg/dL. The subject will continue to be monitored until a glucose level 
between 100 -300 mg/dL and ketone measurement <0.6 mmol/L has been achieved (or the

• Adequate  intravenous  access  cannot be maintained 
• The YSI and back- up YSI, (if available),  stop  functioning  and neither  can be re-
established within 2 hours.  
• Subject requests  to stop  
• Investigator determines  it is in Subject’s  best interest  to stop  the accuracy ( sampling)  visit 
7.2.[ADDRESS_373907] withdrawal  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if:  
• Subject is noted to be pregnant at any Visit.  
• The subject may withdraw if he/she had a serious adverse event that is 
deemed either related to study device or procedures.

seizure or loss of consciousness)  
• Subject experiences DKA (related to the use of the study  device) during home use  
• Subject voluntarily withdraws from study  
• There  is  an infection at  the  sensor insertion site that has not responded to 
treatment within 3 days  
• Subject needs an MRI and Sensor is removed and not replaced.  
• Investigator determines it is in Subject’s best interest to withdraw.  
• Subject is lost to follow- up 
• Subject dies  
7.2.[ADDRESS_373908]’s participation is considered complete after Visit 9 (or Follow -up Visit ). A Subject 
may choose to withdraw at any time without adverse effect on their care. The subject will 
continue with their medical follow- up, according to standard -of- care. The reason for study 
withdrawal  will be documented.  
 
In the event that a subject withdraws from the investigation and is lost to follow- up, the 
Investigator will make all reasonable efforts to locate a Subject and encourage Subject to return for Sensor removal. If a subject is lost to follow -up, three separate telephone calls 
should be made to attempt to schedule a follow- up visit or obtain follow- up information. 
All attempts and contacts should be documented in the source documents. The subject’s Primary Care Physician may also be contact[CONTACT_305552].  If the Subject does not respond to the three telephone calls, then the Investigator will send a certified letter to the Subject. The Subject will be considered lost to follow- up if this 
communication is unsuccessful.   
7.2.6 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who  exit the study prematurely may  not re-enter  the study,  and will not be replaced.

Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  29 Sep. 2017 29 Sep 2017   • Administrative  decision  
 
The Medical  Monitor  will review  adverse  events  on a scheduled periodic  basis as outlined 
in Section 13.13.  In the case of device- related  serious  adverse  events, the Medical  
Monitor  will consult with the Sponsor  and Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_305502]-  being  of the Subjects.  
 
 The study may be suspended for subject safety reasons.   If two or more subjects are 
stopped (subject withdrawal per  section 7.2.4) for the  same adverse event related to 
device, and/or insertion/removal procedure , then the associated portion of the study 
should be suspended to allow for an investigation. For example, if two subjects are stopped 
due to infections that do  not respond to treatment within three days, new sensor 
insertions should be suspended while the root cause  is investigated.  
 
In the  event  that that study is  stopped, the Investigator  will promptly  inform the Subjects  
and ensure  appropriate therapy  and follow -up, including  Sensor  removal.   Additionally  the 
investigator  will promptly  inform the  IRB and provide  a detailed written explanation.  The 
pertinent regulatory  authorities  will be informed  according  to local regulations.  
 
7.4 Termination  of Investigator or  Investigational  Site 
Senseonics  reserves  the right  to terminate  an investigator/investigational site for any of the 
following reasons,  which are considered  major deviations:  
• Failure  to secure subject informed  consent including  protection of personal  data  
prior to enrollment  
• Failure  to report  unanticipated adverse device effects  and serious adverse events to 
Senseonics  and to the IRB/ EC within its required  reporting  time  after  learning  of the

8.2.2 Residual Risks Associated  with the Investigational  Device  
Components  of the Senseonics  CGM  System  are manufactured under  the Quality System 
provisions  of ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2003.  
Risk analysis  has been  performed  and adequate control put in place as  prescribed  in 
relevant  provisions  of IEC [ZIP_CODE],  ISO [ZIP_CODE],  and IEC [ZIP_CODE]- 1, in accordance  with the 
requirements  of ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2003.  Residual  risks associated  with the device included risks  in 
the categories  of electromagnetic  and thermal energy,  biocompatibility,  biologic,  chemical 
and mechanical factors, and  user -related  error.   All identified risks  have  been  reduced as far 
as possible using various control methods including  software  revision  and re-validation,  
hardware  design  modification, packaging  and sterilization  process  validation  and labeling  
revision.  The calculated residual risks  were  determined to be acceptable for conduct of 
this clinical investigation.  
8.2.3 Risks Associated  with  Participation in the Clinical Investigation 
This clinical investigation  involves  subjects  with diabetes  mellitus.  These subjects  may  
experience hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia  as a consequence of their  existing  condition 
and medical  management  (e.g.  insulin administration).  For this study, hyperglycemia  and 
hypoglycemia  will not be reported  as adverse events  unless  meeting  criteria of a Serious  
Adverse  Event.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_305504].  
Should a known side effect(s) occur  to administered  medication(s)  used  in the intervention, 
such  effects  will be reported as part of the adverse event  description and will not be 
considered  a separate adverse  event.  
The amount of blood  drawn for in-clinic  testing  during    the study is  below  the acceptable  
limits  of blood donation of approximately 475 mL; hence it  does  not pose any  additional  
unacceptable  risk to the subjects.  
This clinical investigation  involves  the following  procedures  that present risk:  placement  of 
an intravenous catheter, frequent blood  sampling,  and conduct of hyperglycemia  and 
hypoglycemia  challenges at the clinic  visits.  In addition, Subjects  in this study may use  an 
insulin  pump or syringes to administer subcutaneous  insulin.  
 
The following  risks  are potentially  associated  with such  procedures:

cells  in the body, which in turn  may  increase the  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_305506].  This increase  in 
risk associated  with each X-ray procedure is  extremely low but does  slowly increase with  
the increasing  number  of X-rays tests  you have.  
 
Even  though there  are no known risks  of ultrasound imaging,  it can produce  effects  on the 
body.  When ultrasound  enters  the body, it heats  the tissues  slightly.  In some  cases,  it can 
also produce  small pockets  of gas in body  fluids  or tissues  (cavitation).  The long -term  
effects  of tissue  heating  and cavitation  are not known .

10 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION,  CASE  REPORT  FORMS  AND  DATA  MANAGEMENT  
 
Data in this study  will be collected  on Case  Report  Forms  (electronic or paper)  as well as 
electronic  file transfers.  
 
10.1 Source Documents and Case Report Forms  
The investigator  or his/her  designee  at each  site is responsible  for recording  investigation -
related  data  onto the  CRFs  and maintain  source  documentation supporting  the data.  Good  
Clinical Practice  in the documentation on source  documents  and CRFs  will be followed.  For 
source  documentation or if papers  CRFs  are used, the data must be legibly  written in ink. If 
changes  are required, a single  line is to be drawn  through the incorrect  information,  the 
correct  information  written in and the change  initialed  and dated by [CONTACT_305560].  The reason  for correction may  be noted, unless  obvious.  Pencil,  correction  
fluid or correction  tape  must  not be used  and incorrect  information  must  not be obscured 
(scribbled -out).  
The investigator  must  review,  sign,  and date  the CRFs  as indicated on the form  or 
electronically;  these  responsibilities  cannot be delegated  to another  person.  It is the 
investigator’s  responsibility  to comply with  regulatory  requirements  including, but not 
limited  to, the maintenance  of accurate,  complete  and current  records  relating  to the CRFs.  
Data  clarification  forms  (DCFs) may  be generated  by [CONTACT_305561]  (or designee) or by [CONTACT_305562]  a monitoring  visit.  DCFs  are treated as CRFs  and are completed  and signed  
by [CONTACT_26546].  
The Sponsor  (or their  designee) will review  the data against  the original source  documents  
and ensure  any noted discrepancies  are resolved  by [CONTACT_305563]. Subject data  
Senseonics, Inc.  Confidential Information  Page 76 of 99 
Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  29 Sep. 2017 29 Sep 2017   will be compared  to information  originally  recorded  on source  documents  related  to the 
trial (i.e. professional notes, laboratory reports,  investigation -specific  workshee ts, etc.).  
Investigation- related  information  collected  on CRFs  will be entered  into a secure database.  
The database  design  and installation  will be validated prior  to use. 
Validation  techniques  used  by [CONTACT_305564].  Each database must  pass a series  of standard  tests  that demonstrate  the usability 
and correctness  of the database  system  to approved specifications.  The test process  
generates  detailed test result  logs,  which are provided  as part of the database  
documentation.  
The details  of data  review,  database  cleaning  and data  querying  are described  in a Data 
Quality  and Management Plan (DQMP).  This plan  is updated throughout the investigation 
as amended data  management  requirements  and investigation- specific data  conventions  
are determined.  
A comprehensive EDC User  Guideline  will be developed  for participating  investigational 
sites describing  general  instructions  on CRF completion;  this guideline  also includes  
investigation - specific  data  entry, and query management  instructions.  
Data  entered by [CONTACT_305565],  protocol  deviations, and any other  ambiguous  data  points.  
 
10.2 Glucose  Measurement  Data  Flow  Process  
10.2.1  Data Logging 
The Transmitter is a rechargeable,  external  device worn over  the Sensor  insertion site that 
supplies  power  to the  Sensor.  The Transmitter periodically  (usually  every 5 minutes)  reads  
sensor  data  and calculates  sensor  glucose  and trends.  The information  from the  
Transmitter is then transmitted  for display  to a handheld device  (e.g.  Smartphone)  via 
Bluetooth Low Energy with AES- CCM  encryption.  At any one time,  the Transmitter  contains  
all of the data  collected  since  last erasure,  extending  back in time  to the limit  of its 
capacity.  Each  Sensor  reading  is recorded  with a timestamp. Successive uploads  from a 
subject’s  assigned  Transmitter can be assembled  into a cumulative  time  profile,  using these 
timestamps.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_373919] Assigned  Transmitters  will be collected  at clinic  visits.  The data  will be 
downloaded by a data  communication  device running  Senseonics’  custom  software  
Senseonics, Inc.  Confidential Information  Page 77 of 99 
Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  [ADDRESS_373920]  party  software  application.  
The Senseonics’  software  application  will identify  the Sensor  serial number  and ask the user  
to enter  the site ID, subject  ID and visit number.  The file name  [CONTACT_305591]. T ransmitter data will also be uploaded to a data 
management system to monitor calibration compliance.    
Incomplete or missing  data  downloads  that cannot be used  in the analysis  or cannot be 
made  available  at a future visit would be considered  missing  data  for the purpose of  
analysis  for the corresponding  time  interval.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_373921]  system.  
Paper strip  records  and/or  electronic records  collected  from the YSI  Reference Glucose  
Analyzer will be retained according  to GCP.  Printouts  should  be labeled, including  a 
patient identifier,  sample number,  and operator  initials,  and either  photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_305508].  
10.2.[ADDRESS_373922]  system.    
Incomplete data  downloads  that cannot be used  in the analysis  or cannot be made  
available at a future  download would be considered  missing  data  for the purpose of 
analysis  for the corresponding  time  interval.  
During and/or  at the conclusion of the investigation, original data  from  the laptop  at the 
clinical site will be transferred to a 21CFR11- compliant  electronic  record  system.  The 
clinical site will be provided a master  CD/USB  of the electronic  data  to meet  record  
retention requirements.  
 
 
11 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
11.1 Statistical Analysis Overview  
11.1.1  General Considerations  
The statistical analysis of the data is  focused on assessing performance via downloads and 
data from the clinic including the Fingerstick Blood Glucose Meter Data (Subject SMBG), the YSI Reference Glucose Data, the Senseonics CGM System Data, and other manual entries ( 
Senseonics, Inc.  Confidential Information  Page 78 of 99 
Protocol #:  CTP -0031   , Version 04    Effective Date:  [ADDRESS_373923] Number ). Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all 
subject Baseline and outcome data collected during the study.  Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, and ranges.  Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency distributions.  
 Statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_305566] (e.g., MATLAB and SAS® 9.4).   
Adequate source document verification and/or audit activities will be utilized to assess the validity of investigation conclusions.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_288170].  
11.1.2  Randomization and Data Pooling across sites  
Subjects will not be randomized.  Subjects will be selected consecutively (i.e., selecting every subject in the order they present at the site) among those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  All subjects will receive sensors  and transmitter s.  The  primary effectiveness 
endpoint (MARD) will be analyzed with data pooling across sites.  Site effects will be examined, but only descriptively .  
11.1.3  Sensor Evaluation Period  
The Senseonics CGM System performance will be evaluated in the period after insertion.  
The Transmitter will assess the Sensor’s signal sensitivity in real time for any premature failure independent of the expected lifetime based on time from insertion.  If the 
measurement of potential degraded response of the Sensor optical system signal drops 
below a pre -defined percent of its original value and/or systemic patterns in Sensor accuracy 
to entered calibration points drops below a pre -defined threshold, then the  device has 
reached it end of life (sensor retirement) and will no longer provide glucose readings.  This end of life determination marks the end of the accuracy evaluation period for this Sensor.  The distribution of times between Sensor insertion and end of life or completion of 
scheduled study visits, whichever occurs first will be summarized.  
11.1.4  Expected Paired Points by [CONTACT_305567] *

The safety endpoint is the incidence of device -related or insertion/removal procedure -related 
serious adverse events (SAEs) in the clinic a nd during home use through [ADDRESS_373926] -insertion.     
 An Adverse Event is considered ‘related’ if the relatedness is categorized as ‘possibly related’, 
or ‘related’. The assessment of seriousness and relatedness made by [CONTACT_305570].  The numbers of SAEs and the percentage of patients with SAEs will be reported for each SAE type that is observed, identified as device -related, procedure -
related or unrelated to the study (Table 3  in APPENDIX 1 ).   The count and proportion of 
patients experiencing at least one device -related or procedure -related SAE will be presented. 
No inferential statistic al analysis will be performed.  
 
Other  safety endpoints include:  
• Incidence of insertion/removal procedure or device -related adverse events  in the clinic 
and during home use.  
• Incidence of all adverse events in the clinic and during home use.  
• Incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_305480], hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis 
occurring during home use.  
• Incidence of reported hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events occurring during home use.

 11.3 Effectiveness Endpoints  
11.3.1  Summary  
The effectiveness  endpoint will be the mean absolute relative difference (MARD), calculated  
for all paired Sensor and reference measurements through [ADDRESS_373927]- insertion data.  
11.3.2  Effectiveness Endpoint  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Effectiveness End point: Criteria  
The effectiveness objective is to descriptively document the distribution of absolute 
relative difference across all evaluable subjects and to estimate  the MARD. The MARD will 
be estimated initially when all the subjects complete [ADDRESS_373928].  There is no hypothesis to be tested.  No inferential statistical analysis will be performed.  
 The effectiveness endpoint is the mean absolute relative difference (MARD), defined as the 
average of absolute difference of paired Senseonics CGM System and reference glucose 
readings divided by [CONTACT_305572] (reference) for all reference glucose values, that is:   
 
𝐌𝐌𝐌𝐌𝐌𝐌𝐌𝐌 = ��∑|  (𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆 )𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐌𝐌  –(𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆𝐆 )𝐌𝐌𝐒𝐒𝐑𝐑𝐒𝐒𝐌𝐌𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐑𝐑 𝐒𝐒 |

Where, n is the total number of CGM and reference glucose pairs  during the evaluation 
period, that is, after 30 days of Sensor use for the interim analysis, and after 90 days of use 
for the final analysis .    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Size and Power Calculation  
This study does not feature any inferential statistics.  The sample size for the study was not determined based on a power calculation.  Instead, the sample size of 36 subjects with 
sensors inserted was selected based on the objectives of the study and was  mutually 
agreed upon between the Sponsor and the FDA.

requirements  of the approving IRB  or EC, US Code o f Federal  Regulations applicable to  
clinical studies, ICH GCP  E6, ISO [ZIP_CODE] and other applicable  regulatory requirements.  
 
This clinical investigation  will not  be initiated until approval  has been obtained from the  FDA 
or local regulating authority  as well as IRB/  EC. No deviation from the  protocol will be 
implemented without the prior review  and approval of the Sponsor and /or IRB except  
where  it may  be necessary to eliminate an immediate  hazard to  a subject.  In such case,  the 
deviation will be  reported to  the IRB and Sponsor per  their reporting requirements.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_373934] or (legally  authorized representative)  prior to participation  in the clinical 
investigation,  according  to the local clinical site’s IRB  and applicable  regulatory  
requirements.  
The Investigator  will prepare  an informed  consent form  (ICF) in accordance with this 
protocol  and applicable  regulatory  requirements.  Prior to the start  of the study or  revision  
to study, the informed consent form  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_305577],  and then must be submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_1201]. A copy  of the final  IRB 
approved consent form and  notification of approval  of the clinical protocol  must  be 
received  and approved by [CONTACT_305578].  Timely  
approvals  for the continuation of the trial as well as the informed  consent form  at each  
clinical site must  also be forwarded to the  Sponsor.  
While  an Investigator  may discuss   general availability of the investigation  with  a 
prospective  subject without first obtaining  consent, informed  consent  must  be obtained 
from a subject prior to initiation  of any clinical procedures  dictated by [CONTACT_760]  (e.g.,  
pregnancy testing)  that are performed solely  for the purpose of determining  eligibility  to 
participate  in the clinical  investigation.  
The informed  consent process  includes  both verbal and written explanation.  Subjects  must  
be fully  counseled  and informed of their  options,  risks  and benefits, and have every 
opportunity  to ask questions  about participation  in the investigation.  Insurance  coverage 
will be explained  to the subject.  This process  includes  a thorough explanation of the 
informed  consent document that the subject will be asked  to sign acknowledging  that they  
understand and desire to participate  in the investigation.  The subject will be provided a 
copy  of the signed  informed  consent form.  The original ICF remains  at the investigational  
site.

13.7 Training  
The Sponsor  or designee will  provide training  to the investigator(s)  and site personnel.  
Training  will occur  before the  first device use and/or  protocol -specific  task.  To ensure  
protocol  and regulatory  compliance  as well as accurate data  collection,  site training  will 
include a detailed  review  of the protocol, device accountability, CRF completion, 
investigation -specific  procedures,  monitoring  logistics,  and regulatory  requirements.  The 
appropriate  investigator(s)  and site personnel  will be trained  on procedures  for insertion  
and removal of the Sensor  by [CONTACT_5944]  (e.g.  trained  investigators  and 
investigative  staff, Sponsor  personnel)  using  appropriate  training  materials  (e.g.  
investigator  meetings,   , demonstrations, labs,  webinars, etc.).  Only  the personnel  
responsible for the insertion and removal of the sensor  will be required  training  on the 
insertion/removal procedures.  
Documentation of site personnel  qualification  and training  will be maintained  in the site’s

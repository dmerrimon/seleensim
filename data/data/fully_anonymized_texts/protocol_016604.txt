1.[ADDRESS_1178362] common cause of cancer-related death.[1] Survival at 5-years 
remains a dismal 33%, with a median survival of approximately 12 months for patients with stage 
IV disease.[2, 3] While systemic chemotherapy can extend survival for patients, only surgical 
resection offers the chance for cure. Unfortunately, only 25% of newly diagnosed patients with 
gastric cancer are eligible for resection due to metastatic disease at presentation.[4] 
A major barrier to successful surgery in gastric cancer is its propensity for peritoneal metastasis. 
Metastases range from microscopic (i.e., positive cytology) to overt tumor nodules and omental 
caking. Moreover, diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis is challenging as non-invasive modes of 
identification are insensitive. As such, laparoscopic staging is recommended for newly diagnosed 
patients without radiographic evidence of metastases. In addition to visual inspection at 
laparoscopy, in nearly 20% of cases, peritoneal washings with cytopathologic examination will 
identify microscopic peritoneal disease.[5] Thus, the addition of staging laparoscopy and 
peritoneal cytology can prevent non-curative laparotomy in 23-31% of patients considered 
surgically resectable due to no radiographic evidence of metastasis.[6, 7] 
To address the unique problem of peritoneal metastasis, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been evaluated in several studies 
attempting to establish this technique as a treatment strategy for gastric cancer. Unfortunately, the 
lack of standardization across studies and the failure to reproduce positive results have left the 
purported benefit of CRS/HIPEC in question.[8] In studies where a survival advantage has been 
shown, it was primarily in patients with low disease burden and when complete resection could be 
achieved.[9] For patients in whom complete macroscopic resection cannot be achieved, systemic 
chemotherapy remains first-line therapy. Our branch has an open treatment protocol (17C0070; 
HIPEC for Gastric Cancer) for patients with gastric cancer and limited peritoneal carcinomatosis. 
Patients with low peritoneal cancer index (PCI ≤ 10) who have received a minimum of [ADDRESS_1178363] been enrolled and treated. The median PCI at time of 
study enrollment was 5. Although this low PCI portends a better prognosis, the median time to 
progression in the 5 of 12 patients with adequate follow-up is 6 months. While this study is 
ongoing, it highlights the severity of the disease and the urgent need for better therapy. Moreover, 
less than 50% of patients screened with laparoscopy for that trial (17C0070) have proven eligible 
based on a PCI greater than 10. 
Metastatic gastric cancer is commonly treated systemically with a fluoropyrimidine and platinum 
chemotherapeutic agents. This combination therapy has a modest median survival benefit of 1.6 
months compared to single agent therapy.[4] In patients with good performance status and limited 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178364] been shown to increase time to 
progression and overall survival.[10] The first successful targeted therapy of gastric cancer with 
trastuzumab for HER2-positive tumors conveyed a mere 2.7 month median overall survival 
advantage in the 20% of patients in which HER2 was overexpressed.[11] [12] Beyond first-line 
therapy, most second-line options are limited.[13] Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. 
anti-PD-L1) show great promise, few patients with peritoneal metastasis are eligible for 
immunotherapy. Based on the Keynote-[ADDRESS_1178365] likely tumors to either express PD-L1 and/or respond to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors are EBV+ or microsatellite unstable (MSI-hi) tumors. Based on 
TCGA data in gastric adenocarcinoma, EBV+ and MSI gastric cancers are molecularly distinct 
from the so-called Genomically Stable (GS) molecular sub-type. Peritoneal metastasis is most 
likely to occur in the diffuse histologic subtype of gastric cancer, which makes up 70% of the GS 
molecular sub-group in the TCGA data set. In our own prospective analysis of patients with 
metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (17C0044; Molecular Profiling of Gastric Tumors) we have re-
capi[INVESTIGATOR_847577]-L1 positivity or microsatellite instability (MSI-hi, by 
[CONTACT_704117]) (data not shown).
1.2.[ADDRESS_1178366] limited viable treatment options. One 
potential treatment strategy is normothermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (without cytoreductive 
surgery). Intraperitoneal (IP) drug delivery is an effective treatment strategy in certain solid tumors 
prone to peritoneal carcinomatosis. The rationale for regional chemotherapy to the peritoneal 
surfaces is to maximize drug delivery to affected sites of disease while increasing the therapeutic 
window by [CONTACT_769302]. Work performed at NCI and elsewhere has established the 
pharmacokinetic rationale for IP drug delivery.[14-16] Subsequent clinical studies have 
established IP chemotherapy as the optimal treatment for patients with ovarian carcinomatosis, 
primary peritoneal mesothelioma and appendiceal mucinous neoplasms.[17-19] 
For intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration, taxanes are ideal agents given their high 
molecular weight and hydrophobic properties that allow for prolonged intraperitoneal 
retention.[20]  Taxanes are a class of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents that induce excessive 
polymerization of tubulin resulting in dysfunctional microtubules, which leads to mitotic arrest 
and subsequent cell death.[ 21]  In a review of intraperitoneal pharmacokinetics by [CONTACT_847590], 
paclitaxel was found to have the highest peak intraperitoneal concentration compared to other 
commonly used intraperitoneal agents.[22] When compared to cisplatin, the most common 
chemotherapeutic used for HIPEC, the peak concentration of paclitaxel was 50 times higher.[22]  
This high intraperitoneal concentration is believed to lead to its direct cytotoxic effects.  While 
concentrations can remain elevated as long as 72 hours after infusion[23], morphologic signs of 
cellular distress are noted just 6 hours after infusion.[24] Another challenge of intraperitoneal drug 
delivery is the complex network of microvasculature that supplies tumors.  It is hypothesized that 
increased blood supply enhances metabolic features of these cells and leads to increased 
proliferation and further metastatic spread.[25] This vast microvascular network is also 
hypothesized to contribute to the ineffectiveness of intravenous chemotherapeutics.  The purported 
mechanism for systemic therapy resistance is leakage of chemotherapeutic agents from the 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
8vasculature of the tumor into the free peritoneal space.[25] In vitro experiments using human 
gastric cancer nodules have demonstrated that intraperitoneal paclitaxel was found to result in 
injury or collapse of tumor micro vessels. This angiogenic inhibition results in a layer of hypoxic 
cell death surrounding a far less metabolically active central tumor.[25]  We hypothesize that the 
coadministration of systemic chemotherapy can have an additive effect given the microvascular 
destruction and decreased likelihood of intraperitoneal leakage. 
Depth of tumor penetration by [CONTACT_847591] a single dose is limited.  The two most commonly 
used taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, have been directly compared in vitro.  In a study by [CONTACT_847592], paclitaxel tumor invasion was found to be twice that of docetaxel but the majority of drug 
accumulated in the first 100 µm of tumor.[26]  In order to augment the limited penetration of a 
single dose, the utilization of peritoneal catheters has been employed for repeated dosing.  In early 
Phase I studies, the pharmacokinetic analysis and safety profile of paclitaxel has been established.  
Kodera et al, established a recommended dose of 60 mg/m2 with minimal toxicity when 
intraperitoneal paclitaxel was given as a single agent.  At this dose level, drug half-life ranged 
from 17.4-65.3 hours.[27]  Although peak intraperitoneal concentration was 7000 times higher 
than that of the plasma[28], some systemic absorption was expected.  Another Phase I study of 
combined intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel established a recommended dose of 20 
mg/m2.[29]  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a one-third dose reduction of the intraperitoneal paclitaxel, the authors were 
able to demonstrate consistently high peak peritoneal concentration at both 48 and 72 hours after 
administration.[29] 
Clinical studies using intraperitoneal taxanes have shown good patient tolerance and limited 
systemic adverse events, even with concomitant intravenous administration (Table 1).[23, 27-31]  
In Phase I studies, anemia was the most common toxicity although the majority of these were 
Grade 2.[29]  In that same Phase I study, of the six patients that received 20 mg/m2, no Grade 5 
toxicity was seen and leukopenia and neutropenia were the only Grade 3 or 4 toxicities.[29]  In a 
subsequent Phase II study of 40 patients receiving both intraperitoneal and intravenous paclitaxel, 
the rate of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were 40% and 15% respectively.[23]  The most common 
adverse events were neutropenia (38%), leukopenia (18%) and anemia (10%).[23]  Notably no 
patients experienced adverse effects related to intraperitoneal infusion such as abdominal pain or 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].[23]

9Table 1: Summary of Previous Intraperitoneal and Intravenous Paclitaxel Administration in Gastric 
Cancer
Intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel has shown promising results in Phase I and II studies.  
When repeated intraperitoneal paclitaxel infusion was added to approved systemic chemotherapy 
regimens, tumor response rates greater than 50% were observed with associated median survival 
times of 22.6 and 17.6 months.[23, 31] Specifically, a Phase II study by [CONTACT_847593] S-1 chemotherapy in patients with 
macroscopic peritoneal metastases in patients with gastric cancer.[31] S-1 is a combination of three 
compounds (tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil potassium) developed as a replacement for infusional 5-
FU therapy. In that study, 35 patients were enrolled and evaluated for survival endpoints. The 1-
year survival was 77%, which compared favorably to approximately 50% 1-year survival in 
historical controls treated with systemic therapy alone. Moreover, in patients with measurable 
intraperitoneal disease, the objective response rate was 71% and positive peritoneal cytology 
resolved to negative in 97% (28 of 29) of patients. Although Yamaguchi et al. demonstrated safety 
and efficacy of IP and IV paclitaxel along with S-1, this oral 5-FU prodrug is not available in the 
[LOCATION_002]. S-[ADDRESS_1178367] observed that patients whose tumors do not respond to 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy do not appear to benefit from cytoreductive surgery.  Therefore, we 
propose using IP paclitaxel to aid in the identification of patients who may benefit from this 
treatment strategy of regional and systemic therapy.

Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178368] sub-classifications of gastric cancer based on unique molecular 
alterations.[32, 33 ] These studies have revealed novel correlations of molecular subtypes with 
distinct tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes.[33] Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a particularly 
morbid and common feature of gastric adenocarcinomas. The association between diffuse-type 
tumor histology and increased rates of carcinomatosis is well-documented.[34] Somatic gene 
alterations that impair E-cadherin protein expression are also a recurring feature of sporadic 
diffuse-type gastric cancers.[35] Germline mutation in CDH1, the gene that encodes the cell-cell 
adhesion protein E-cadherin, results in a heritable form of diffuse-type gastric cancer that may aid 
our understanding of sporadic disease.[36] Even though disruption of cell-cell adhesion is cited as 
an initiating event in this histologic subtype, true drivers of tumor invasion and peritoneal 
metastasis have not been characterized.[37, 38] Better understanding of molecular alterations 
associated with unique patterns of metastasis may uncover key drivers of distinct malignant 
phenotypes.[39] 
Translational and basic science research efforts have been established in our branch to investigate 
drivers of peritoneal metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma. Clinical protocols incorporating both 
sporadic and hereditary diffuse gastric cancers (HDGC) are being conducted in parallel to 
strengthen the search for key drivers of peritoneal metastasis. Patients who undergo risk-reducing 
total gastrectomy for HDGC and those enrolled on the gastrectomy and HIPEC trial are providing 
a unique opportunity for in-depth analysis of molecular changes associated with gastric cancer 
initiation, invasion and metastasis. 
The current protocol is designed to address the challenges outlined above by [CONTACT_56620] a strategy 
for treating gastric cancers with peritoneal metastasis. Our aim is to investigate the use of 
intraperitoneal paclitaxel chemotherapy as an adjunct to systemic therapy for gastric cancer with 
peritoneal carcinomatosis. We hypothesize that the combination of systemic and regional therapy 
will result in disease control and improved intraperitoneal progression free survival. If so, this 
strategy could serve as a platform for adding novel anti-cancer agents for the treatment of this 
deadly disease.
1.2.4 Simulated Metastasis Assay with Relevant Tissue (SMART) Chamber 
In the Surgical Oncology Program laboratory of [CONTACT_847609], a novel tumor modeling 
system is being developed, referred to as the Simulated Metastasis Assay with Relevant Tissue 
(SMART) Chamber. Correlative studies in proteogenomic characterization of primary and 
metastatic cancers and ex vivo tumor tissue modeling of peritoneal metastasis will be added to this 
study, utilizing the SMART Chamber.  In conjunction with ongoing laboratory work, segments of 
the peritoneum are removed from patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis at the time of operation. 
This peritoneal tissue is utilized in the SMART Chamber system to imitate conditions of metastasis 
within the abdominal cavity. This ex vivo tissue model system allows for observation of peritoneal 
metastasis, real-time cellular imaging, and manipulation of tumor-environment interactions. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1178369] our goal of realizing personalized translational 
cancer care. The ability to recapi[INVESTIGATOR_847578]: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178370] targeted and/or 
immunomodulatory effects. However, the predictive accuracy of drug testing is predicated on 
models that accurately represent the architectural/cellular organization of the tumor and faithfully 
reflect the in vivo biology. We have satisfied many of the requirements of an ideal tumor model 
utilizing resected mesothelial metastases to create the SMART (Sample Microenvironment of 
Resected Metastatic Tumor) System. Multiple solid tumors commonly manifest with metastatic 
disease to the mesothelial surface (peritoneum, pleura, liver capsule) and some are candidates for 
metastasectomy. During these operations, resected tumor-bearing mesothelial tissue is affixed to 
a specialized platform and perfused in a sterile, oxygenated circuit at 370C to maintain normal 
physiologic parameters (Figure 1). Circulating oxygenated perfusate within the system is 
comprised of human plasma (from the patient), DMEM media, antibiotics, insulin (slow infusion). 
Figure 1: The SMART System Consisting of SMART Platform.
The SMART platform (Top Left) is designed to mount the human mesothelial tissue containing 
tumor and be suspended in the reservoir of perfusate (Bottom Left), the SMART chamber. The 
chambers suspend maximum of 4 SMART platforms and placed on stir plate in the incubator 
(Middle). The SMART system boasts a physiologic oxygenated perfusion circuit that is suitable to 

Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178371] architecture, and expected mitotic activity 
(Figure 2A ). RNA sequencing was performed as well to compare transcriptomics between Day 0 
and Day 4. Genes associated with hypoxia, oncogenes/tumor suppressor, cancer stem cells, 
metabolism, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-mesenchymal transition were isolated from the sequencing data and 
demonstrated conservation of transcriptomics (Figure 2B). These results ultimately demonstrate 
that tumor nodules in their native, functional microenvironment can be preserved ex vivo for 4 
days with fidelity.

Day 4. 
B (Right): Conservation of transcriptomics in hypoxic panel, oncogene/tumor suppressor, cancer

Due to the translucent nature of the mesothelial tissue, the system is readily amenable to dynamic 
interrogation with confocal, two photon and light sheet microscopy. This avenue of investigation 
is supported by a research collaborative agreement (RCA) with BioLegend and our affiliation with 
CAT-I to develop fluorescently labelled Fab fragment for live cell labelling. For example, with the 
increasing use of checkpoint inhibitors like Pembrolizumab in solid tumors, we decided to evaluate 
the drug in the SMART system using tumor from a patient with gastric adenocarcinoma and a 
patient with colorectal adenocarcinoma. We demonstrated immune cell engagement with tumors 
cells for both gastric and colorectal adenocarcinoma, and captured tumor cell lysis with the latter

to the immune system while others are ostensibly resistant.

1.2.6 Rationale for Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel Dose Increase
The primary objective of this study (19C0129) is to determine the progression free survival (PFS) 
in patients with peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer after repeated intraperitoneal (IP) 
infusion and systemic paclitaxel administration with concomitant capecitabine therapy. The first 
patient treated on study was on 07/14/2020. Since that time [ADDRESS_1178372] received IP and IV 
paclitaxel on study. Based on an IP paclitaxel dose of 20 mg/m2, the average dose administered to 
our patients is 34.5 mg (range 31-38.4 mg). We selected this IP paclitaxel dose based on existing 
clinical trial data in patients with gastric cancer suggesting both safety and potential efficacy for 
treating carcinomatosis. We have observed no treatment-related deaths and no toxicity attributed 
directly to the IP paclitaxel dosing. Of the 4 patients, as of 03/09/2021, three patients are now off-
treatment and one is currently undergoing a second course of therapy without any serious adverse 
events.
Objective responses have been mixed with 2 patients exhibiting stable disease after 2 courses of 
treatment; [ADDRESS_1178373] course of treatment; 
and 1 patient has stable disease after 1 course of treatment. One of the patients with stable disease 
after 2 courses of treatment was subsequently enrolled and successfully treated on our Phase II 
study of gastrectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (17C0070). 
Because an IP paclitaxel dose of 20 mg/m2 appears both safe and tolerable in our current study we 
wish to increase the IP dose of paclitaxel to 60 mg/m2 (see Section 3.2.2). The aim of this dose 
modification is to increase the likelihood of objective intraperitoneal tumor response to therapy. 

Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
14The data supporting the use of 60 mg/m2 dosing of IP paclitaxel comes from both the gastric cancer 
and ovarian cancer literature. The seminal study by [CONTACT_312092].  [18] utilized both IP cisplatin 
(100 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) added to intravenous paclitaxel for treatment of patients 
with stage III ovarian carcinoma. Notably, the most common reason for discontinuation of IP 
chemotherapy was catheter-related complications. Although direct comparison of that study to 
19C0129 cannot be made, the fact that 60 mg/m2 of IP paclitaxel combined with IP cisplatin was 
safe, tolerable, and effective in the context of concomitant intravenous paclitaxel suggests that an 
IP paclitaxel dose of 60 mg/m2 would be safe and tolerable in our gastric cancer patients, also.
One could argue whether we should use an even higher dose of IP paclitaxel to achieve greater 
objective tumor response in our study. To that point, early studies in ovarian cancer showed a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for IP paclitaxel given every 4 weeks was 150 mg/m2 [40].  That 
dose level has been associated with chemical peritonitis [41]. However, subsequent studies in 
ovarian cancer patients using 75 mg/m2 showed safety and minimal toxicity, which was most often 
attributed to abdominal discomfort and nausea [42]. Similarly, a study by [CONTACT_847594]. [28] in 
patients with advanced gastric cancer used an 80 mg/m2 dose of IP paclitaxel that was well-
tolerated when combined with intravenous paclitaxel and oral S-1.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase II trial designed to determine the efficacy of intraperitoneal paclitaxel in 
combination with intravenous paclitaxel and oral capecitabine in patients with gastric cancer and 
intraperitoneal metastasis.  
After placing the peritoneal chemo infusion port Days 1 to 3, as dictated by [CONTACT_20599], patients 
will begin intraperitoneal paclitaxel and intravenous paclitaxel (Day 1) followed by [CONTACT_847596] 1 to the morning of Day 15, followed by a 7-day treatment 
free interval, in each 3-week cycle.  One course will comprise 3 treatment cycles (3 weeks each; 
total 9 weeks). There will be a total of two courses for patients with an objective response or stable 
disease.
Treatment evaluation will take place after 3 cycles of treatment are completed (+/- 7 days) with 
repeat staging studies and laparoscopy to assess for treatment response. Patients with progressive 
disease will be taken off study treatment and will be followed for survival. Patients with an 
objective response or stable disease will continue to a second course of treatment. After a second 
course of treatment (+\- 7 days), patients will have repeat staging studies and laparoscopy to assess 
for treatment response. Patients with objective response will receive no further study-related 
treatment after the second course but will remain on study for determination of secondary 
endpoints. 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178377], continued treatment with IP and IV paclitaxel with oral capecitabine may 
be considered. The rationale is that the intervention is potentially effective and that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_847579]. These patients who choose continued treatment will not be evaluated 
for primary endpoint analysis.
Second, and in the setting of exceptional response with residual peritoneal disease (PCI < 10), 
cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be considered an 
alternate treatment option. This surgery would be done off protocol under a generic standard of 
care protocol within CCR. Patients would stay on this study to be followed for survival. 
Lastly, patients may elect to stop therapy per protocol and initiate observation without active 
treatment.
The IP port and catheter will be removed at the time of study completion, or earlier if needed (such 
as surgical extraction due to port complications or patient withdrawal from the study) except in 
circumstances of death, lost to follow-up, and in cases in which patients may not be able to return 
to NIH if they progress on study (and consequently the port and catheter may remain in place).

3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
3.2.1 Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy will be delivered via an implantable subcutaneous-peritoneal port.  
Body surface area will be calculated at each cycle for each patient.
Patients who are concurrently receiving or requiring any of the agents listed below, which may 
increase the risk for paclitaxel/capecitabine related toxicities, will have all medications reconciled 
by a NIH Clinical Center clinical pharmacist.
The following drugs will be discontinued one week prior to administration of paclitaxel:
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
 Conivaptan 
 Cyclosporine
 Disulfiram 
 Eliglustat
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]

 Echinacea 
The following drugs may be held, or doses modified, during therapy as indicated by [CONTACT_847597]:
 Metronidazole 
 Gemfibrozil
 Filgrastim G-CSF
 Platelet inhibitors
3.2.2 Intraperitoneal and Intravenous Paclitaxel Administration
Intraperitoneal paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) will be diluted in 500 mL of 0.9% NS and warmed to 37⁰ C. 
The solution will then be infused as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_847580] 3-week cycle on Day 1. The 
patient will then be instructed to adjust position every 15 minutes for 2 hours. 
Intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) will be administered concomitantly over 3 hours (+ 1 hour)* 
diluted in 100 to 250 mL of 0.9% NS once per 3-week cycle on Day 1.  Standard intravenous 
hypersensitivity prophylaxis (dexamethasone 20 mg, diphenhydramine 50 mg and ranitidine 50 
mg) will be given at least 30 minutes prior to intravenous paclitaxel. *Note: Refer to Section 3.3.1 
for dose delays/dose modification guidelines in the event of an adverse event.
IP and IV paclitaxel will be given at the same time. We will ask the Pharmacy to add a brightly 
colored label that says “ NOT for IV use” to the IP chemo bag so that Paclitaxel IP and IV doses 
do not get reversed.
3.2.3 Capecitabine Administration 
Patients will receive a 14-day supply of oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2) to be taken twice a day 
starting the evening of Day [ADDRESS_1178378] period during each 3-week cycle. Capecitabine tablets 
should be swallowed whole with water within 30 minutes after a meal.
[IP_ADDRESS] CCR Self – Administered Study Drugs Policy Regarding Capecitabine 
All oral self-administered investigational agents will be properly accounted for, handled, and 
disposed in accordance with existing federal regulations and principles of Good Clinical Practice. 
All oral study drugs will be recorded in the patient diary found in Appendix C . This will be used 
as a memory aide for subjects. The clinical research team will maintain the primary source record. 
Subjects should be asked to bring the diary as well as unused study agent and empty containers 
with them to each study visit. If a subject goes off study while at home, the research nurse will 
ensure and document the return of the unused oral investigational agents from the participant. 
Unused investigational study agents will be disposed and destroyed per CC Pharmacy SOPs.
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
Toxicity will be evaluated before each treatment cycle according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0.
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
233.3.1 General Guidance for Dose Modification

Version Date:06/01/2022
253.3.3 Treatment Delays and Modifications for Medical Needs
Patients experiencing complications of their disease or other medical illness not attributable to 
disease progression, or protocol therapy may also require brief interruptions and delays that will 
not be considered protocol deviations and will not be separately reported. A patient that interrupts 
therapy for more than 3 weeks will be taken off treatment.
3.4 SUBCUTANEOUS INFUSION PORT COMPLICATIONS
Patients experiencing complications associated with or related to implanted infusion port 
including, but not limited to: malfunction, non-function, erosion, infection, leak, or severe pain 
may require medical treatment (antibiotics, pain medications, etc.) and/or surgical extraction. 
Surgical re-implantation of a port may be delayed until the cause of removal has been fully 
addressed. Delays due to port problems may require brief interruptions in treatment. Delays that 
last ≥ 5 days will be reported as Protocol Deviations. A patient that interrupts therapy for more 
than 4 weeks (30 days) will be taken off study treatment.

In the event a patient goes off-study prior to completion of the follow up time points, the data 
gathered from their completed QOL questionnaires will be included in the final analysis. 
We will use tools specifically developed for assessment of QOL in gastric cancer patients: FACT-
Ga. Measures will be initially administered by [CONTACT_847599]. The Research Nurse or designee will assess the patient’s ability to read, and if the patient 
is unable to read, it will not be administered. The Research Nurse or designee will administer the 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178394] and pencil. QOL data will be 
collected in stored in Labmatrix. If it becomes available, electronic versions of QOL questionnaires 
will be developed with the assistance of Jason Levine, MD, and will be offered to patients via 
secure, web-based application. The patients will be directed to complete the questionnaires using 
the following instructions:
We would like to better understand how you and other persons in this study feel, how 
well you are able to do your usual activities, and how you rate your health while you 
are participating in this research study. To help us better understand these things about 
you and other persons participating in this study, please complete these two 
questionnaires about your quality of life. Both questionnaires should not take longer 
than [ADDRESS_1178395] applicable.
You should answer these questions by [CONTACT_202699]. Your husband/wife or other family 
members or friends should NOT assist you in completing the questionnaires. Please fill 
out the questionnaires now. Return the questionnaires to me when you have completed 
them. We will be asking you to complete these again during some of your follow up 
visits.  If you have any questions, please ask.
The Research Nurse or designee will request that the patient complete the questionnaires prior 
to seeing the physician, as the interaction between the patient and physician may influence the 
patient’s answers to the questionnaires.
Once the patient has completed the questionnaires, the Research Nurse or designee, will review 
them for completeness and thank the patient for their cooperation. Subsequent measurements 
will be administered by [CONTACT_735627], or designee, when the 
patient returns for follow-up visits as specified in Section 3.6.5.

[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Data Collection
All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered and 
stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure program, with access to Labmatrix 
limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of 
Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password 
restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to subjects without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient 
ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, material type, as well as box 
and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center patient number are 
provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the processing method 
(delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).
[IP_ADDRESS] Sample Storage and Destruction
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20 or -800C according 
to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at NCI Frederick 
Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples 
must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_195108] a manner consistent with IRB approval. 
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the 
rights to use the material.
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_555530] a deviation. Reporting will be per the requirements of 
Section 7.2.
Sample bar-codes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of 
Labmatrix. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, 
dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables.
5.3.2 Laboratory of Pathology
Tissues designated for clinical diagnostics are transported to the Laboratory of Pathology (LP) 
where they are examined grossly and relevant portions are fixed, embedded in paraffin and

back to patients without authorized access to the NCI Labmatrix database.
Samples are stored in freezers at -80°C (sera, plasma, tissue samples) or under liquid nitrogen 
(cells), according to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite at [CONTACT_258748]’s 
laboratory. Access to samples from a protocol for research purposes will be by [CONTACT_83939].
5.3.5 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described below. The 
study will remain open so long as sample or data analysis on this protocol continues. Samples from 
consenting subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject 
withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed.
If the patient withdraws consent the participants data will be excluded from future distributions, 
but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able to be 
retrieved.
Any specimens that are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be transferred to protocol 
13C0176 as all patients will have prospectively consented to this study. Access to these samples 
will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use 
the material. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138703] a deviation. 
Reporting will be per the requirements of Section 7.2.
5.3.6 Management of Results
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_35114] a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings 
that is current at the time of primary analysis. (A list of current guidelines is maintained on the 
CCR intranet: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists ). 
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_148408] a request to provide a blood sample to be sent to a 
CLIA certified laboratory. 
If the research findings are verified in the CLIA certified lab, the subject will be offered the 
opportunity to come to NIH (at our expense) to have genetic education and counseling with the 
NCI Genetics Branch to explain this result. If the subject does not want to come to NIH, a referral 
to a local genetic healthcare provider will be provided (at their expense). 
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No 
interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.

and PO capecitabine. 
Radiographically evident/measurable disease will be evaluated for response and progression in 
this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_847603] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).[43] Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. The determination of response of 
subradiographic intraperitoneal disease will be evaluated using the criteria indicated in 
Section 6.3.1.
6.3.[ADDRESS_1178406] one of the following criteria:
A reduction in PCI score of greater than or equal to 4 points from baseline PCI.
Histopathologic evidence of tumor treatment effect in representative peritoneal biopsies 
obtained at the end of treatment course by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-staging laparoscopy.
Resolution of small volume ascites for patients in whom ascites was previously 
documented.
Stable disease will be declared in patients who meet at least one of the following criteria:
Absence of new intra-peritoneal or extra-peritoneal disease.
A PCI score within 2 points of baseline PCI (e.g., baseline PCI +/- 2).
Intra-peritoneal (IP) progressive disease will be defined as:
Increase in PCI of score of greater than 4 points from baseline PCI.
New ascites requiring repeat (more than 1) therapeutic paracentesis
oAscites need not be positive for malignant cytology.
Malignant bowel obstruction.
New intraperitoneal nodules or masses concerning for peritoneal metastasis
oIf imaging studies are inconclusive, percutaneous biopsy may be used to confirm.
oIf biopsy is determined not feasible, then repeat interval imaging may be used.
oIn the case of interval imaging, if the previous inconclusive findings are confirmed 
as disease, then the original date of the inconclusive/suspi[INVESTIGATOR_847587].
Decline in performance status not attributed to other medical causes.
Extra-peritoneal (distant) progressive disease will be defined as:
New extraperitoneal and/or solid organ (i.e., liver) metastasis.
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
426.3.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
Staging laparoscopy: The PCI scoring system along with tissue biopsy and intra-operative video 
or image recording will be used to evaluate and document measurable disease. 
Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1178407] slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used, and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_118582]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy: Such techniques may be useful to confirm progression of disease when images are 
captured and/or biopsies are obtained.
Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published. In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_1178408]-line trials in ovarian cancer. 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
43FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:
a) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.
b) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDGPET 
at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that 
site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD
c) FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. 
The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol 
and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must 
be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of 
FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to confirm progression or recurrence of 
disease. The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any ascites that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side 
effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.
6.3.[ADDRESS_1178409] observation of progressive disease within 
the peritoneal cavity (increase in PCI from baseline or new ascites requiring repeat drainage; see 
Section 6.3.1), or death, whichever comes first. Extraperitoneal DFS (i.e., anything other than 
peritoneal surface disease progression) is defined as the duration of time from initiation of therapy 
to the date of first observation of progressive disease at sites other than the peritoneal surface, such 
as the liver, lymph nodes, and any other solid organs outside the peritoneal cavity.

gastric cancer in order to determine the most relevant drug metabolizing enzymes and 
transporters (DMET) through pharmacogenetic analyses.
Define the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_847576], and other associated 
cancers, through genotype/phenotype correlations.
Determine the molecular changes and mechanisms of tumor initiation, invasion and 
metastasis in gastric cancers with peritoneal metastasis.
Evaluate chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agent effects of systemic paclitaxel 
administration with concomitant capecitabine therapy in patients with peritoneal 
metastases from gastric cancer using a novel ex-vivo platform, the SMART System.
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE D ETERMINATION
The goal will be to determine if the IV/IP paclitaxel and oral treatment with capecitabine described 
above could be associated with an 11-month median progression free survival (PFS) compared to 
a maximum 6 months median PFS based on historical controls. 
Patients will enroll in two cohorts: those treated with prior systemic chemo and those who are 
treatment naïve. In each of these two cohorts, with 32 evaluable patients receiving the proposed 
therapy,* assuming accrual would take place over approximately [ADDRESS_1178412] patient has begun the treatment 
on protocol, there would be 80% power to determine whether there is a difference between a 
median 5 month PFS beginning at the date IV/IP paclitaxel therapy starts and an improved [ADDRESS_1178413], using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.[44] In 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
46practice, a Kaplan-Meier curve beginning at the initiation of treatment, and appropriate confidence 
intervals at selected time points, will be provided to help interpret results relative to the expected 
results. 
*Note: Per amendment version date 03/09/2021, the dose level of intraperitoneal paclitaxel in this 
protocol has been increased from 20 mg/m2 to 60 mg/m2, and therefore, the primary endpoint 
evaluation on this study will focus on patients treated at the higher (60 mg/m2) dose level. Subjects 
already receiving the study intervention prior to amendment approval will remain at the initial 
dosage (1.2.6); no intra-patient dose escalation will occur on this study. 
It is expected that 8-10 patients per year may be enrolled to each cohort in this protocol, a total of 
16-20 per year; thus, accrual is expected to be completed within approximately 4 years. Following 
the amendment dated 03/09/2021, in which the dose level of intraperitoneal paclitaxel was 
increased, the primary endpoint evaluation will focus on patients treated at the higher (60 mg/m2) 
dose level. With a requirement for 32+32=64 evaluable patients, to allow for the 4 subjects treated 
at the lower (20 mg/m2) dose level of intraperitoneal paclitaxel as well as a small number of 
inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 74 patients.
8.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES
Intention to treat: any subjects who enroll onto the trial and provide consent and who receive an 
intraperitoneal port and receive one cycle of IV/IP chemotherapy will be included in analyses.
8.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
8.4.1 General Approach
Determine the progression free survival (PFS) for patients treated on the protocol using a Kaplan-
Meier curve.
8.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoints
In each of the cohorts, based on the patients treated at the 60 mg/m2 dose of intraperitoneal 
paclitaxel (refer to Section 8.2), a Kaplan-Meier curve will be constructed for PFS beginning at 
the date IP chemotherapy begins, and the median PFS in months will be reported along with 80% 
and 95% two-sided confidence intervals. Progression of disease in any body site will be considered 
events for this analysis.  
8.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint
Intra-peritoneal progression free survival (iPFS) will be determined based on the identification of 
only intraperitoneal sites (e.g., new, malignant ascites, peritoneal nodules, ovarian metastases, etc.) 
of disease progression using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, using only these progression sites as events. 
The distant (extra-peritoneal) disease free survival (dDFS) will be determined based on 
identification of only distant sites of disease progression, such as lungs or intra-parenchymal liver, 
using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, using only these progression sites as events. A Kaplan-Meier curve 
will be constructed beginning at the date IP chemotherapy begins and the median iPFS and dDFS 
in months will be reported along with 80% and 95% two-sided confidence intervals. The frequency 
of objective histopathologic response to therapy will be based on patients with metastatic tumors 
that are biopsied at the end of a course of therapy and graded according to standard pathologic 
techniques.
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
47Overall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]-Meier method, along with the median OS and a 
95% confidence interval on the median.
The morbidity of this treatment strategy will be reported using frequencies of complications and 
adverse events as well as any descriptive material needed for clarification.
8.4.4 Safety Analyses
None, other than description of morbidity of the treatment strategy.
8.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Baseline demographic characteristics will be reported.
8.4.6 Planned Interim Analysis
None.
8.4.7 Sub-Group Analysis
None.
8.4.8 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data
None.
8.4.9 Exploratory Analysis
Exploratory analyses on this study will aim to evaluate peritoneal cytology, tumor deposit, and 
plasma circulating tumor cell response. Peritoneal washings for cytology and peritoneal biopsies 
taken at baseline and at the end of course will provide information regarding immediate changes 
due to treatment as well as longitudinal information across treatments. Evaluating the response of 
circulating tumor cells to intraperitoneal delivery of chemotherapy will provide additional insight 
into the overall disease response. Tumor cell expression profiles and peritoneal immune cell 
profiles will be evaluated to identify potential biomarkers that are predictive of response to 
treatment.
Evaluation of circulating tumor cell (CTC) and immune subsets will be undertaken in 
order to determine the impact of the study intervention on the difference in the CTC 
levels between the time points; the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be utilized for 
determination and testing for statistical significance. If multiple statistical tests of these 
laboratory-based parameters are performed, the results will be reported without any 
formal correction for multiple comparisons. 
Pharmacokinetic data from pre- and post-intervention analysis of blood and tumor biopsy 
tissues from study timepoints will be studied using longitudinal and paired analysis 
methods.
Analysis of patient blood for pharmacogenetic studies will be done to evaluate the 
genomic DNA and genotype of targeted drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters 
(DMET).

Patients with a diagnosis of gastric cancer will be eligible for this study. Eligibility assessment will 
be made solely on the patient’s medical status. Recruitment of patients on this study will be through 
standard CCR mechanisms. No special recruitment efforts will be conducted. The investigational 
nature and objectives of this trial, the procedure and the treatments involved, the attendant risks 
and discomforts, potential benefits and potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_847589] a 
signed informed consent. This is particularly important for this study because of the nature by 
[CONTACT_735629]. The patients must subject themselves to a major operative procedure 
with the attendant risks and complications associated with it in order to receive treatment without 
any assurance of benefit from the treatment.

research participation (Section 9.4), all subjects will be offered the opportunity to fill in their 
wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance 
Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can 
make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively 
impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_83859] (ACAT) for evaluation to assess ongoing capacity of the subjects and to identify 
an LAR, as needed.

9.4
EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
The potential benefit to patients undergoing this therapy would be palliation in terms of preventing 
or delaying intra-abdominal tumor progression and metastases elsewhere which can be a 
devastating and painful source of symptoms and cause for demise. In addition, significant tumor 
response may extend progression free and overall survival. The risks for this protocol include the 
risks associated with any abdominal surgery. This includes postoperative bleeding, intraabdominal 
infection, wound healing complications including fascial dehiscence, enterocutaneous fistulas, 
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/[ADDRESS_1178416] the 
patients under risk. A combination of surgery and chemotherapy may decrease healing at a time 
when healing of abdominal wounds and bowel anastomosis is essential for recovery. All attempts 
will be made to avoid unnecessary enterotomies or a bowel resection where feasible. In the case 
of intra-abdominal catastrophe after surgery, patients may require reoperation.
All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurred by [CONTACT_62564]. However, there 
are procedure-related risks (such as bleeding, infection and visceral injury) that will be explained 
fully during informed consent. If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of the biopsies, 
immediate medical treatment is available at the NCI’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Although 
no compensation is available, any injury will be fully evaluated and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_338723].
9.4.[ADDRESS_1178417] benefit 
to individual subjects.
9.4.2 Risks
Potential complications may arise on this study from both the placement and long-term 
management of the intraperitoneal infusion system (refer to Sections 3.4 and 11.3.2) and from risks 
associated with the use of paclitaxel (11.1.2) and capecitabine (11.2.2). Protocol risks also include 
those standardly associated with abdominal laparoscopy, including pain, ileus, ascites, injury to 
organs in the abdomen (such as the intestines, stomach, bladder and blood vessels) and the 
possibility of anesthetic mishap. There may be an increased risk of wound healing or infection 
after surgery due to the use of paclitaxel and capecitabine.
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sampling
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting.
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram (EKG)
This procedure is associated with minimal discomfort.
[IP_ADDRESS] Questionnaires Risk
Questionnaires may contain questions that are sensitive in nature. The patients are asked to only 
answer questions they are comfortable with.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Biopsy 
Needle biopsy is minimally invasive and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a very safe procedure. Depending upon the 
site being biopsied and the type of biopsy being performed, risks can include infection of the 
biopsy site, development of a hematoma, and bleeding. Rarely more significant complications can 
occur when structures near the biopsy target are entered with the needle (e.g., puncture of lung or 
bowel). Surgical procedures for biopsy specimens will not be conducted for the sole purpose of 
research specimen collection.
[IP_ADDRESS] Conscious Sedation
The common side effects of conscious sedation include drowsiness, delayed reflexes, hypotension, 
headache, and nausea. These are generally mild and last no more than a few hours.
Abbreviated Title: IP and IV Paclitaxel for GC
Version Date:06/01/2022
[IP_ADDRESS] General Anesthesia
Risks of general anesthesia include temporary confusion and memory loss, although this is more 
common in the elderly, dizziness, difficulty passing urine, bruising or soreness from the IV drip, 
nausea and vomiting, shivering and feeling cold, sore throat due to the breathing tube.
[IP_ADDRESS] Scans and Contrast 
The most common discomfort is the length of time a patient must lay still during a scan. Patients 
may also become uncomfortable with the closed space of the machines.
There is a small risk of reaction in scans involving contrast. Common reactions include pain in the 
vein where the contrast was given, a metallic or bitter taste in the mouth, headache, nausea and a 
warm or flushing feeling that lasts from 1-[ADDRESS_1178418] agent or anesthetic, which 
may cause pain at the site where the IV is placed and there is a small risk of bruising or infection, 
or inflammation of the skin and vein with pain and swelling.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation 
This research study involves exposure to radiation from 6 PET/CT scans as well as [ADDRESS_1178419] to the roughly the 
same amount of radiation as 32.0 years of background radiation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Physical Risks of Genetic Research
Risk of Receiving Unwanted Information
Anxiety and stress may arise as a result of the anticipation that unwanted information regarding 
disease related DNA sequencing or disease tendencies, or misattributed paternity. Patients will be 
clearly informed that the data related to DNA sequencing and genetic analysis is coded, 
investigational, and will not be shared with patients, family members or health care providers.
Risk Related to Possibility that Information May be Released
This includes the risk that data related to genotype, DNA sequencing or risk for disease tendency 
or trait can be released to members of the public, insurers, employers, or law enforcement agencies. 
Although there are no plans to release results to the patients, family members or health care 
providers, this risk will be included in the informed consent document.
Risk to Family or Relatives
Family members or relatives may or may not want to be aware of familial tendencies or genetic 
risks of disease which may cause anxiety about possible future health problems. As previously 
noted, patients will be notified of any medically significant and actionable incidental findings. 
Study research results will not be shared with patients.
9.5 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting.  A designated study

injury and possible renal failure.  Additionally, bone marrow suppression has been documented 
resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Patients with Dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase deficiency (DPD) are excluded from this study as they may experience serve and 
life-threatening adverse events due to the inability to metabolize 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).  Patients 
currently on anticoagulation therapy are at an increased risk of bleeding.  There are reports of 
increased PT and INR following initial administration of capecitabine, requiring more frequent 
PT/INR monitoring as warfarin dose adjustments.  Patients with a previous history of coronary 
artery syndrome are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity including: myocardial infarction, 
dysrhythmias, electrocardiogram changes, cardiogenic shock and sudden death.  Jaundice has been 
noted in patients with hepatic metastasis on capecitabine, but these patients will be excluded from 
this protocol.  Finally, skin reactions including toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], Steven Johnson

TIMEPOINTS IN P ROTOCOL 13C0176)
Note: This specimen collection appendix is solely for general reference only. Official 
specimen collection timepoints for correlative studies on 13C0176 will be as indicated in 
protocol 13C0176.
The following peripheral blood will be collected for research at Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6, and at 
End of Course (unless otherwise indicated):
8 mL blood in an EDTA Lavender top tube (Baseline only, for genomic DNA);
8 mL blood in a CPT Blue/Black top tube; 
8 mL blood (plasma) in a Sodium Heparin Green top tube; 
8 mL blood (serum) in SST Gold or Marble top tube; 
[ADDRESS_1178429] dose of treatment 
intervention, and then every 6 months during Years 3-5, and then yearly thereafter:
8 mL blood in a Streck Cell Free DNA tube;
8 mL blood (plasma) in a Sodium Heparin Green top tube; 
8 mL blood in a CPT Blue/Black top tube; 
8 mL blood (serum) in SST Gold or Marble top tube; 
45 mL spot urine sample in a urine clean catch container.  
Peritoneal biopsy tumor tissue will be collected as available at Baseline and at End of Course for 
immunohistochemistry. 
Normal and tumor tissue, and tumor tissue with mesothelial metastases for proteogenomic 
analysis, will be collected for research during the IP port placement (see Section 3.6.2). 
Additionally, peritoneal lavage fluid collected during the operation will be sent for 
cytopathologic analysis for research purposes.

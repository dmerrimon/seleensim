 access to legal, safe abortion services in the US.  
Trained ph armacists already successfully deliver care for 
stigmatized hea lth conditions, including sexually 
transmitted infections, family planning, and e mergency 
contraception. In addit ion, pharmacy dispensing of 
mifepristone is already a reality in other coun tries, such 
as Australia, wh ere it has improved access to medication 
abortion, pa rticularly in rural areas (Grossman and 
Goldstone 2015) ; pharmacy dispensing is also be ing 
implemented in Canada (OCP 2017) .  
Pharmacy dispensing of M ifeprex® by [CONTACT_172173] f or women. Mail -order d ispensing in particular 
could allow w omen to by[CONTACT_172174], financial, or 
insurance obstacles to clinic- based care and  receive 
abortion care earlier in pregnancy (Drey, Foster et al. 
2006, Grossman, Grindlay et al. 2013, Jerman, 
Frohwirth et al. 2017)  and h elp to facilitate provision of  
medication abortion through telemedicine, reducing the 
disparity in access be tween rural and urban settings 
(Grossman, Grindlay et al. 2011, Grossman, Grindlay et al. 2013) . In light of a declining number of abortion 
providers in the US  (Jones and Kooistra 2011, Jones and 
Jerman 2014) , mail -order  dispensing could also help 
increase the nu mber of clinicians will
ing and a ble to 
provide medication abortion by [CONTACT_172175] d ispensing the medication at their facilities.  
Mail -order  dispensing of mifepristone would not affect 
the standard of care or recommended c linical protocol 
for medication administration. Mifeprex® would still be 
prescribed to patients by [CONTACT_172176]® following the current standard 
assessment of eligibility for medication abo rtion. The 
only difference i n this study is that the patient would 
obtain the mifepristone by [CONTACT_2319] d irectly from a mail-
order pharmacy , rather than in a clinic facility.   
Home administration of M ifeprex® is now allowed 
under the up dated M ifeprex® labeling (FDA 2016) . 
Study participants will be told by [CONTACT_172177] d take the Mifeprex®, a nd 
participants will be c ontacted within three days of when 
the prescription is sent  to determine if they received the  
Mifeprex® and if they took the medication as  
prescribed.

PRIMAR Y 
ENDPOINT The primary ou tcome will be acceptability  of undergoing 
medication abortion with drugs dispensed by [CONTACT_2319] -order 
pharmacy , measured by [CONTACT_172179] -order service again if they needed 
another abortion, as well as the proportion who report they 
were “satisfied or very satisfied” with the medication 
abortion. We will also capture patient perspectives on 
receiving the medications by [CONTACT_172180]- ended 
responses. In addition, we will ask patients who decline to enroll in the study their reasons, including the reasons why 
they are not interested in receiving the medications by [CONTACT_172181]. 
SECONDAR Y ENDP OIN TS Secondary  outcomes will include feasibility of providing 
medication abortion with drugs dispensed by [CONTACT_2319]-order 
pharmacy, clinical effectiveness and safety  of medication 
abortion with drugs dispensed by [CONTACT_2319]- order pharmacy, 
and provider acceptability of the mail -order pharmacy 
model for dispensing medication abortion drugs. Feasibility will be  assessed by [CONTACT_172182] 2 and by [CONTACT_2006] 3 and whether patients’ confidentiality is maintained 
when they receive the medications by [CONTACT_2319]. We will also 
ask patients whether the medications were lost, stolen or 
damaged, resulting in the patients needing to return to 
clinic, or go elsewhere. We will also assess feasibility 
through open- ended interviews with providers of MA at 
the end of the study. Clinical effectiveness and safety will be assessed through analysis of electronic health record 
data, including the proport ion of patients who experience 
a complete abortion and experience complications, including adverse events, related to the abortion. Provider 
acceptability will be assessed qualitatively through open -
ended interviews with providers and staff involved in the study. We will identify advantages and disadvantages of 
mailing the medications  from the perspective of providers 
and staff.

PLANNED I NTERIM 
ANALYS ES No formal interim analysis is planned. Serious and 
unexpec ted adverse events will be monito red on an 
ongoing basis throughout the study. 
STATI STICS  
Primary Ana lysis Plan We will use descriptive analyses using chi-square and t 
tests where app ropriate to assess patient  satisfaction with 
the model and clinical outcomes of patient participants. 
Rationale for Number of 
Subjects  We aim to recruit up to 25 patients for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_172128] , and an additional 440 (at 
minimum) to 625 (maximum) patients at 15 -20 sites 
across the country. The sample size calculation for this 
study is based on a measure of acceptability: the 
proportion of patients who report they would use 
medication abortion again if they needed another abortion 
(89.7%). We would like to determine if acceptability of 
medication abortion when receiving the medications by 
[CONTACT_172183] 5 percentage points lower than 
89.7%. With a 2- sided alpha of 0.05, 10% adjustment for 
clustering , and 10% loss to follow -up, a  final analytic 
sample size of approximately 400 gives us  79% power, 
and a n analytic sample of 560 gives us 92 % power to 
assess acceptability. We plan to recruit a minimum  
sample of 440 patients (main study).  
 
We a im to interview  up to 50 providers/staff.  This sample 
size will be de termined by [CONTACT_172184]/staff 
involved in  the study at s ites. 
 
 
1 BACKGROUN D 
 
Medical termination of intrauterine pregnanc y, also known as medication abo rtion, is a safe and effective 
alternative to surgical abortion (vacuum  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]). Mifeprex® (generic: mifepristone), a progestin 
antagonist that competitively interacts with progesterone at progesterone- receptor sites, used together 
with m isoprostol is the gold standard regimen for medication abortion. I n studies performed in the United 
States up to 70 d ays gestation using this dosing regimen, 97.4% of  patients reportedly had a  complete 
abortion (FDA 2016) . Another 2.6% received surgical intervention, o r vacuum  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], for reasons 
such as ongoing pregnanc y, patient request, bleeding, medical necessity and i ncomplete exp ulsion. 
 
Medication abortion up to [ADDRESS_201898] been  reported with this treatment, this complication is very rare; only [ADDRESS_201899] 3 million u ses of the medication (FDA 2011) . 
Uterine bleeding requiring medical or surgical intervention is also a known complication of the treatment. 
Heavy bleeding requiring surgical treatment occurs in approximately 1% of patients, and blood 
transfusion is required in <0.1%. Adverse events that are more common i nclude nausea, vomiting, 
weakness, fever/chills, headache, diarrhea and  dizziness (FDA 2016) .

 Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: 12 SEP 2007  
  
In Ma rch 2016, the Food an d Drug Administration (FDA) approved an upd ated label for M ifeprex® to 
reflect recent research pub lished since the drug’s original approval in 2000 (FDA 2016) . The approved 
dosing regimen includes oral mifepristone (200 m g) followed by a dos e of misoprostol (800 mcg) 
administered buc cally 24-48 hour s later. The c hanges made to the label included a more effective dosing 
regimen con taining less mifepristone (200 mg instead of 600 mg) and m ore misoprostol (800 mcg instead 
of 400 m cg) via the buccal route, extension of the gestational age limit for treatment from [ADDRESS_201900] ug’s US  distributor, and the FDA. 
 
In addition, the upda ted label no longer requires that Mifeprex® or misoprostol be taken in the facility 
where they are dispensed. A systematic review of nine studies with over 4,500 p articipants compared 
outcomes of  those who took  misoprostol at home to those who t ook it in a clinical setting (Ngo, Park et al. 
2011) . Complete abortion and com plication rates were not  different between the groups, but women who 
used m isoprostol at hom e were m ore likely to be s atisfied and r ecommend the method t o a friend. I n one 
US study of 400 w omen at  six sites, 32% chose to take mifepristone at hom e, and complete abortion rates 
were similar between those who  took the drug in the clinic and at home (96%-97%) (Chong, Frye et al. 
2015) . Among those who took mifepristone at hom e, 82%  reported taking the medication at the time they 
planne d with their provider, and  no pa rticipant took it after [ADDRESS_201901] demonstrated that MA has a high level 
of accep tability for a majority of women seeking pregnancy termination (Beckman and Harvey 1997, 
Christin -Maitre, Bouchard et al. 2000) . In a meta-analysis of appr oximately 4,500  patients who 
underwent pregnancy termination with mifepristone and m isoprostol, over 85%  of women were  
satisfied w ith the exp erience (Ngo, Park et al. 2011) . Medication abo rtion accounts for a growing share 
of US abortions, from  17% of non-hosp ital procedures in 2008 t o 31% in 2014 (Jones and Jerman 
2017) . Medication abortions a ccoun ted for 45% of all abortions up to nine w eeks gestation in 201 4, up 
from 26% in 2008 (Jones and Jerman 2017) . 
 
Some evidence s ugge sts that improved access to mifepristone is associated w ith a reduction in the 
proportion of abortions performed in the second trimester, which is important from a pub lic health 
perspective because later abortion is associated with a significantly increased risk of complications and 
death compared to early abortion (Zane, Creanga et al. 2015) . In one st udy in Iowa, development of a 
program providing medication abortion using telemedicine w as associated w ith a significant increase in 
the proportions of abortion that were performed wi th medication. A fter controlling for other factors, 
women seeking abortion in the two years after telemedicine w as introduc ed had a significantly higher 
odds  of obtaining a first-trimester abortion compared to the two years prior (Grossman, Grindlay et al. 
2013) . Conversely, in [LOCATION_007], second-trimester abortion increased by 27% in the year after restrictions o n 
access t o abortion were imposed, including limitations on the use of medication abortion  that led to a 
70% decline in use  of this method (Grossman 2017) . 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_172129], there is evidence that some wo men face b arriers 
accessing this method, and this can be particularly distressing when t hey have a strong preference for the 
method (Baum, Wh ite, Hop kins, P otter, & Grossman, 2016) . In particular, the closure of abor tion 
facilities across the cou ntry, which has increased the distance wo men must tr avel to access abortion care, 
may make it harder to access  medication abortion (Cartwright, Karunaratne et al. 2018) . The l onger travel 
distances, which increase the cost and logistical difficulty of getting to a clinic, may create delays that 
push women past the gestational age limit for medication abortion (Baum, White et al. 2016, Fuentes, 
Lebenkoff et al. 2016) .

 Medication abortion in the US is primarily offered by  [CONTACT_172185]. Uptake of medication 
abortion provision among private phy sicians has been less than e xpected—especially in areas not served 
by [CONTACT_172186]. In 2005, t here were only four providers of M ifeprex® medication 
abortion t hat were located more than 50 m iles from any surgical abortion pr ovider (Finer and Wei 2009) . 
One reason for the lack of uptake am ong private physicians may relate to the Mifeprex® Risk 
Evaluation and M itigation Strategy (REMS) p rogram. 
 
The Mifeprex® REMS  program has three component s (FDA 2016) : 
1. Prescribers must be certified with the program by [CONTACT_172187]  
2. Patients must sign a P atient Agreement Form.  
3. Mifeprex® must be dispensed to patients only in certain healthcare settings, specifically clinics, 
medical offices and hospi [INVESTIGATOR_600], by [CONTACT_170156] a certified prescriber. 
 
This third component  requires that prescribers stock the medication in their facilities in order to 
dispense it on s ite. A qualified clinician who ha s not  completed the certification process and arranged to 
stock the drug in his or her office cannot provide timely medication abortion c are to a woman who 
presents unexpectedly. Consequently, treatment of such a patient would be d elayed, which might 
increase her medical risks of complications from more advanced pregnancy and a later abortion 
(Bartlett, Berg et al. 2004, Mifeprex REMS Study Group 2017) . 
 
We r ecently explored this issue in a survey of practicing obstetricians-gyneco logists (Grossman, 
Grindlay et al. 2017, Grossman 2019) . In 2016- 2017, we performed a survey with a representative 
sample of Fellows and Junior Fellows of  the A merican College of Obstetricians and G yneco logists 
(ACOG) . The survey was sent by [CONTACT_172188], and n on-responde rs were mailed pa per 
surveys. 655 c urrently practicing Fellows responde d to the survey (response rate 67%). 99% reported 
seeing patients of reproductive age. 72 % reported having a patient in the prior year who ne eded o r 
wanted an abortion. Only 23.8%  (95% CI 20.5% -27.4%) reported performing an abor tion in the prior 
year; 10.4 % provided s urgical and medication abortion , 9.4%  surgical only, and 4.0%  medication on ly. 
 
Among those not providing medication abortion, 28% said they would provide the method if they cou ld 
write a prescription for mifepristone and their patients could obtain the medication at a pha rmacy. An 
additional 22% said they were unsure if they would provide medication abortion  in this scenario. Our 
findings suggest that the proportion of obstetrician-gyneco logists providing m edication abortion w ould 
at least double (from 14% to 31% ) if the dispensing restriction in the REMS were removed and 
physicians could write a p rescription for Mifeprex® that could be dispensed at a pha rmacy. 
 
Given this evidence that the dispensing requirement represents a barrier to access, we propose to perform 
a study of the acceptability and feasibility of mail- order p harmacy dispensing of Mifeprex®.  For this 
study, all clinical activities will  remain consistent with the current standard of care and M ifeprex® 
REMS pro gram excep t for the dispensing of Mifeprex®.  In particular, patients will be evaluated for all 
contraindications to the method a ccording to the label, and they will sign the Patient Agreement Form. A 
clinician who  has completed the Prescriber Agreement Form  will write a prescription for Mifeprex® 200 
mg for the eligible patient, which will be transmitted to the mail -order pharmacy.  The patient will then

2 STUDY RATIONALE 
 
The proposed study aims to investigate the accep tability, feasibility and e ffectiveness o f mail- order 
pharmacy d ispensing of Mifeprex®; safety data will also be collected. Because of the data reviewed 
abov e that indicate that the dispensing restrictions on Mifeprex® limit the number of providers of MA, 
the results of this study e ventually could lead to changes in the Mifeprex® REMS th at would improve 
access to legal, safe abortion services in the U S.  
 
Trained ph armacists already successfully deliver care related to stigmatized he alth cond itions, 
including sexually transmitted infections, family planning, and e mergency  contraception. In add ition, 
pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone is already a reality in other coun tries, such as Australia, wh ere it 
has improved acce ss to medication abortion , particularly in rural areas (Grossman and Goldstone 2015, 
Hyland, Raymond et al. 2018) ; pharmacy dispensing of  mifepristone is also being implemented in 
Canada  (OCP, 2017 ). 
 
Mail -order pharmacy dispensing of M ifeprex® could improve acce ss to medication abortion f or 
women in a nu mber of important ways. Mail -order  pharmacy dispensing in the U S cou ld allow 
women to by[CONTACT_172174], financial, or insurance obstacles to clinic-based ca re and receive 
abortion care earlier in pregnancy (Drey, Foster et al. 2006, Grossman, Grindlay et al. 2013, Jerman, 
Frohwirth et al. 2017)  and he lp to facilitate provision of  medication abortion t hrough telemedicine, 
reducing the disparity in access be tween rural and urban s ettings (Grossman, Grindlay et al. 2011, 
Grossman, Grindlay et al. 2013) . In light of a declining number of abortion pr oviders in the US 
(Jones and Kooistra 2011, Jones and Jerman 2014) , mail- order pharmacy  dispensing could also help 
increase the number of clinicians w illing and a ble to provide medication abortion by  [CONTACT_172190]. Because some pharmacies may refuse to carry Mifeprex® ef ven if they were allowed to, 
mail- order pharmacies could improve access to the drug in the future.   
 
Mail -order pharmacy dispensing of Mifeprex® w ould not affect the standard of care or r ecommended 
clinical protocol for MA in terms of the medication, dosage, timing, and  follow-up ca re. Mifeprex® 
would also still be p rescribed to patients by [CONTACT_172191]® 
following the current standard assessment of eligibility for medication abortion. The onl y difference in 
the provision m odel to be evaluated in this study is that the patient would obtain the m ifepristone directly 
from a mail -order pharmacy, r ather than i n a clinic facility.  
 
As not ed abov e, hom e administration of Mifeprex® is now allowed un der the updated Mifeprex® 
labeling (FDA 2016) . Study participants will be told by [CONTACT_172192] t hey shou ld take 
the Mifeprex®, and pa rticipants will be contact[CONTACT_172193] t ook the medication as pr escribed. 
 
2.1 Risk  / Benefit Assessm ent 
 
Potential medical risks to medication abortion pa tients participating in the study are the same as those 
they would incur by [CONTACT_172194] a medication abortion outside of the study. Because they are 
unde rgoing the same clinical assessment prior to obtaining MA , there is no reason to believe that 
dispensing of Mifeprex® by [CONTACT_172195].  In addi tion, patients 
will be given de tailed information about warning signs, such as heavy bleeding, that shou ld prompt them 
to seek care.

The main ri sk related to the study is that the patient m ay not take M ifeprex® at t he time they are told 
to—and potentially that th ey may tak e it later t han 70 days’ ge station (the current FDA gestational age 
limit).  There is al so a risk that they may giv e the m edication to someone else. It should be noted th at 
these risks exist curr ently since the Mif eprex® label allows t hem to tak e the m edication at home, and 
there is no reason t o believe that the risks will increa se due to th e study. Pa tients will also b e surveyed 
on Day 3 to be ce rtain th ey received and t ook the Mifepr ex® as instructed. The eligibility criteria for this 
study will limit gestational age of participants to [ADDRESS_201904] udy. Th e partici pating clinics will not b e 
identi fied in any publicati ons. There  is a potential risk that participating clinics w ill expe rience anti-
aborti on pi[INVESTIGATOR_172130] s if participa tion in t he study becomes known, and thi s has been  discussed with the 
management of ea ch clinic.  
 
These dat a will be used to asses s whe ther it is feasible for ob/gyn and primary care clinics to 
provide medication abortion and for patients to receive the medications by [CONTACT_2319], which could help 
to improv e access to early abortion. 
 
3 S TUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
3.1 Primary Objec tive 
 
The primary obj ective of the study i s to assess th e acceptability  of mail- order pharmacy disp ensing of 
Mifeprex®. Our p rimary outcome will be acceptability m easured by [CONTACT_172196] w ith 
medication abortion (including whether they would use this mail-order MA service again if they 
needed another abortion, satisfaction with the medication abortion experience overall, and whether 
they would recommend the service to a friend), satisfaction with receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], 
reasons for dissatisfaction (open ended questions), and perceptions about the wait time to receive the medications. We will also analyze the reasons why patients who decline participation in the study 
report not being interested in receiv ing the medications by [CONTACT_2319], as indicated in close -ended and open-
ended responses.   
 
3.2 S econdary Objec tives 
 
The secondary objectiv es include to assess feasibility  of the mail -order dispensing model (including the 
determination of the proportion of patients who receive the medications by [CONTACT_2006] 2 and by [CONTACT_2006] 3 after the prescription is sent , the quality of the packaging, whether patient confidentiality was compromised 
due to receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], and the proportion of patients who had to go to a clinic to 
obtain the medications); clini cal effectiveness and safety , including adverse events, with mail -order 
dispensing of m ifepristone; and provider acceptability of the mail -order model method through 
qualitative analysis of in -depth open- ended interviews.

4 CRIT ERIA F OR EVA LUATION  
 
4.1 Primar y Endpoint  
 
Acceptability of the mail- order model will be assessed by [CONTACT_172198] w ith MA (including 
whether they would use this mail- order medication abortion  service again if they needed another 
abortion, satisfaction with the medication abortion experience overall, and whether they would 
recommend the service to a friend), satisfaction with receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], reasons 
for dissatisfaction (open ended questions), and perceptions about the wait time to receive the medications. We will also analyze the reasons why patients who decline participation in the study report not bein g interested in receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], as indicated in close -ended and 
open- ended responses.  
 
4.2 S econdary E ndpoin ts 
 
Feasibility  will be as sessed by [CONTACT_172199] 
2 and Day 3 (two and three days after enrollment (Beckman and Harvey), respectively), and whether patients’ confidentiality is maintained when they receive the medications by [CONTACT_2319]. We will also ask 
participants whether the medications were lost, stolen or damaged, resulting in the patients needing to 
return to clinic, or go  elsewhere. Clinical effectiveness and safety will also be assessed using data 
collected from medical records of participants, including pregnancy outcomes, complications and adverse 
events. The study team will maintain contact [CONTACT_172200]: every three months following Day [ADDRESS_201907] the patient, and details on the pregnancy outcome, delivery, and assessment of the newborn on a Continuing 
Pregnancy Outcome form. Provider acceptability of the mail -order pharmacy model will be  assessed  
through open- ended interviews with providers /staff  of medication abortion  at the end of the study.

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery (not including uterine vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]), and emergency department visits 
requiring treatment for an abortion- related condition. We will also collect and report information on 
abortion- related emergency department visits not requiring treatment and uterine vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_172132], bleeding, and other abortion- related conditions. The prevalence of 
serious adverse events (or major complications) in the study will be compared to published estimates of 
less than 0.5%.

The study w ill be perform ed at  15-20 sites around the country. These will include ob/gyn, family 
medicine and internal medicine clinic sit es in the [LOCATION_002] that do not currently stock mifepristone  
and where clinicians have been newly trained to provide MA. Sites may also include current abortion

[LOCATION_004] , [LOCATION_001] , Rhode Island, Delaware, Colorado, and Pennsylvania  and determined there are no 
barriers to dispensing mifepristone via mail -order pharmacy beyond the Mifeprex® REMS. Before 
launching the study in a new state, attorneys will perform analyses of state law and regulations to ensure 
that there are no barriers to dispensing mifepristone via mail -order pharmacy beyond the REMS. When 
identifying sites, the research team will verify that study sites will have referral systems in place to 
connect patients with back -up specialty care as needed and will document clear referral pathways for non -
emergency aspi[INVESTIGATOR_172133]/emergent situations , where blood transfusion and resuscitation may 
be performed .  
 
At each site, we will identify a site investigator who is a physician and who will oversee all clinical 
activities at the site. Each of the site investigators will complete a Form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), which will be submitted to the FDA to document their participation in the IND study. 
The site investigator will also  sign the Danco Prescriber Agreement Form. The site investigator will 
also oversee the extraction of clinical data from the medical records of study participants. Some sites 
may have  more than one site investigator; in this case, only one co- investigator needs to be a 
physician. R ecruiting w ill take place by [CONTACT_172201], and M ifeprex® will be mailed

 7.2 Prohibited Med ications 
 
As not ed in the Mifeprex® label, although spe cific drug or food interactions w ith Mifeprex® have not  
been studied, o n the basis of this drug’s metabolism by [CONTACT_097] 3A4, it is possible that k etocona zole, 
itracona zole, erythromycin, and g rapefruit juice m ay inhibit its metabolism (i ncreasing serum 
conce ntrations o f Mifeprex®). Mifeprex® should be used with caution in patients currently or recently 
treated w ith CY P 3A4 inhibitors; however, these medications w ill not be p rohibited. 
 
CYP 3A4 inducers such as rifampin, dexa methasone, St. John’s Wort, and certain anticonv ulsants 
(such as pheny toin, phe nobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) may induce  Mifeprex® metabolism (lowering 
serum concen trations of mifepristone). Whether this action has an impact on the ef ficacy of the 
regimen is unk nown. As with all patients, it is important to verify that treatment was su ccessful. Again, 
CYP 3A4 inducers will not be prohibited. 
 
Based on in vitro inhibition information, co-administration of Mifeprex® may lead to an increase in 
serum concen trations of drugs that are CYP 3A4 sub strates. Due to the slow elimination of Mifeprex® 
from  the body, such interaction may be ob served for a prolonged pe riod after its administration. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when Mifeprex® is administered w ith drugs that are CYP 3A4 
substrates and have a na rrow therapeutic range; how ever, drugs that are CYP 3A4 subs trates will not be 
prohibited.

Participants will undergo standard clinical follow -up, either in person or by [CONTACT_756], after the abortion. 
This i s in accordance with the FDA’s updated label for Mifeprex, which no longer includes a 
requirement for in -person follow -up after medication abortion. Patients will discuss the follow -up plan 
with their provider at the time of initial recruitment visit, and this  plan will be written down on the 
information sheet that patients take home with them  and will be documented in the patient’s chart .

clinician study site lead at each site; this person will serve as the main point of contact [CONTACT_172212]. This person will inform providers at the study site about the study and invite them to 
participate in the study training and  provision of medication abortion. The training on medication 
abortion provision will take place at the start of the study at each resp ective clinic site and last for a 
duration of about two hours. After the training, providers will be invited to informally evaluate the 
training and provide suggestions for its improvement. At the training, providers will be asked to provide 
their contact [CONTACT_172213]. If a provider joins the clinic after the training has been completed, but is interested in 
participating in the provision of medication abortion, a s econd training will be arranged as needed. Each 
physician site investigator will oversee all clinical activities at their respective sites and will sign the 
Danco Prescriber Agreement Form.   
 
In addition to their participation as collaborators in the research study, providers at the study site will also 
be invited to participate in  an in -depth interview at the end of the study about their experience with the 
mail- order model . Providers may opt to prescribe medication abortion as part of the study but decline to do 
an interview, or they may decline to prescribe and opt to do the interview. Interviews at the end of the 
study will be conducted by [CONTACT_172214] 30 minutes. Providers will be asked to 
provide their oral informed consent before participating in the interview.

following Mifeprex®).  
 8.3.2 Packaging and Labeling 
 
The mail-order pharmacy will provide M ifeprex® in its standard packaging (blister pack of one 200 
mg tablet). The medication will be labeled w ith the patient’s information according to standard 
procedures prior to dispensing to the patient. 
 8.4 Supply of S tudy Drug  
 
Mifeprex® will be procured from  Danco  Laboratories, LLC, by [CONTACT_9154], who is a  licensed 
physician who ha s signed t he Dan co Prescriber’s A greement. We will use the existing distribution 
system for Mifeprex® that Danco Laboratories has established. In the signed Prescriber Agreement for 
the study, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_172148] -order pharmacy as the site to which the Mifeprex® will 
be shipped. This distribution system is considered to be secure, confidential and controlled. UCSF will purchase the medication and have it shipped to the mail -order pharmacy.  
 
The mail- order pharmacy will ensure that the Mifeprex® stock is kept separate from all other drug 
inventories maintained by [CONTACT_172215]. All study Mifeprex® received and dispensed  from the mail-
order pharmacy w ill be recorded.  
 
8.4.1 Dosage/ Dosage Regimen and A dministration 
 
Subjects will receive 200 mg of Mifeprex® to be taken orally at the time agreed on by [CONTACT_172216] c linician. This will be followed by [CONTACT_172178] 800 m cg administered buccally (at 24-48 hour s 
following mifepristone).

 safe disposal site. If the participant does not want to go to the clinic site, the study team will send the 
participant a postage -paid mailer to ship the unused medications to the UCSF study team, who will then 
safely dispose of them.  
 
8.6 Meas ures of  Treatment Compliance 
 
Participant patients will be contact[CONTACT_7699] 3 and Day 14 after the prescription is sent  to complete 
online surveys , which are detailed be low in section 10.2. A s part of these s urveys, patients will be asked 
if and wh en they took the M ifeprex® and if and when they took misoprostol . If they have not yet taken 
the Mifeprex®, they will be asked when they plan to take it, and t hey will be c ontacted after that date to 
complete the Day  3 Sur vey. If they received  the M ifeprex® but decided no t to take it, t hey will be asked 
wheth er they r eturned it to the study clinic as instructed.  
 
The research team will review all participant survey responses upon submission to ensure treatment 
compliance. If a participant reports being seen somewhere else for a complication or reports any 
unusual symptoms in either survey, the research team will in form the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_172150]. In addition, the research team will receive automatic notifications through the 
online survey platform, Qualtrics, in the following cases, after which the team will contact [CONTACT_2416] b y email and/or telephone to follow up:  
• If a participant reports taking the misoprostol vaginally (instead of buccally)  
• If a participant reports not taking the misoprostol after taking mifepristone  
• If a participant reports taking mifepristone at >70 days gestation (based on the gestational age 
dating at initial clinic visit)  
• If a participant reports taking the misoprostol <24 hours or >48 hours after the mifepristone  
• If a participant reports taking the misoprostol but not taking the mifepristone  
This information will enable the research team to monitor and capture all epi[INVESTIGATOR_172151]/or misoprostol.

Demographic information (age, pa rity, race, insurance status, and  ethnicity) will be recorded as part of 
the initial visit and will be abstracted from the medical record. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_172152] U CSF research 
team. Demographic information will also be collected on the Day  3 Sur vey (see section 10.2 ). 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_201928]: date of service past medical 
history current medications blood pr essure, weight, height, and medications p rescribed or dispensed 
(Mifeprex® 200 mg, misoprostol 800 mcg, antibiotics, analgesics, other). A t any follow-up visits, 
unusua l symptoms such as heavy bleeding, excessive pai n, or fever will be recorded, as w ell as any 
treatment given. Wom en wi ll also be asked if they sou ght care elsewhe re since the prior visit, and if so, 
what treatment, if any, they were given. 
 9.1.4 Physical Examination 
 
Blood p ressure, weight, and height will be collected at the initial visit. A targeted phy sical 
examination will be performed at the clinic site acco rding to their current practice. At some sites, 
gestational age of the pregnancy may be determined by [CONTACT_172218].  
 9.1.5 Vital Signs 
 
Vital signs wi ll be recorded at each clinical encounter. 
 9.1.6 Ultrasound 
 
Ultrasound may be pe rformed at  the initial visit to determine gestational age of the pregnancy (if it is not 
performed at  the clinic site, the date and  result of an out side ultrasound will be d ocumented). Ultrasound 
may be pe rformed at  a follow-up visit to determine whe ther the abortion is complete or incom plete or if 
there is an ongoing pregnanc y.

9.2.3 Serum  human chorionic gonad otropin (hCG) 
 
Some patients will have serum hCG measured on the day of Mifeprex® prescription and again 
approximately 8 days after taking Mifeprex ® to assess for completion of the abortion.  These results 
with the date of t he tests will be abstracted from the medical record. 
 
9.2.4 Rhesus  (Rh) factor  
 
Rh factor status will be determined for all patients. If the patient has a documented laboratory result 
of her Rh status, this will be added to her clinical record. If the patient does not have a documented 
laboratory result, a blood draw will be performed  to assess Rh status. Patients who are found to be 
Rh-negative will be contact[CONTACT_172219] (Rhlg) within [ADDRESS_201932] 
information and preferences. Patients may be enrolled during the initial visit if they are eligible based on 
the information available at the time . It is possible that at this point ultrasound results may still be pending 
(for example if the patient need ed to be referred elsewhere for an ultrasound ); if this is the case, patients 
will be tentatively enrolled in the study (asked to complete the informed consent process and the contact 
[CONTACT_982]) and informed that their pa rticipation is contingent on confirmation of their gestational age. Once the 
ultrasound results are known, the provider will update the eligibility form. After determining that a patient 
is eligible for the study, a  clinician at the site will then transmit a  prescription for Mifeprex® 200 mg, 
misoprostol 800 mcg, and any other necessary medications (such as 800  mg ibuprofen) to the mail -order 
pharmacy, and the patient will be given i nformation about when and how to take the medications. The 
patient will be informed that the pharmacy will contact [CONTACT_172220], drug allergies, and whether they have additional questions (note: the patient may also call the pharmacy directly). The patient will be informed to expect the delivery of medications as soon as the following 
business day and no later than 3 business days later.  
 
10.2 Day  3 Survey 
 
On Day 3  (after the prescription is sent) , patient participants will be sent by [CONTACT_172221], 
depen ding on their preference,  a link to an online survey about  their experience receiving the 
medications, a s well as to collect sociodemographic information (see Day  3 survey). If a participant 
prefers, or if she do es no t respond to the email link, she may be contact[CONTACT_172222].  The survey will focus on h er experience 
receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], i ncluding whether and when she received the medications and the 
quality of the packaging, as well as her expe rience taking the Mifeprex®.  We  will also co llect

 information a bout if and when the M ifeprex® and m isoprostol might ha ve been d iverted to another 
person.  If they do not  respond to the survey within two days , participants will be contact[CONTACT_172223]. If a pa rticipant has de cided no t to proceed w ith medication abortion (for 
any reason ), she w ill be enco uraged to complete the Day 3 sur vey, where this information will be 
captured. If a woman ob tained the Mifeprex® and/or misoprostol and h as de cided not to take the 
medication(s), she w ill be as ked to return them to the clinic. 
 
10.3 Clinical f ollow-up 
 
Women unde rgoing medication abortion gene rally undergo clinical follow-up to ensure that the abo rtion 
is complete. Follow up to ensure no ongoing pregnancy at approximately 7- 14 days after the initial visit 
may be completed in one of three ways: 1) an in -person clinic visit with ultrasound, 2) an in- person 
clinic visit with serum hCG (in the case that serum hCG was measured on the day the Mifeprex ® was 
prescribed ; the follow -up laboratory test may be performed at an off -site laboratory ), or 3) a telephone 
follow -up with the clinic at approximately 1 week after Mifeprex® was taken, followed by a urine 
pregnancy test at 3-4 weeks (at home) post medication abortion. Results from these measures will be 
documented in the clinical record and later abstracted for data collection. No study-related activities 
will be p erformed as p art of this clinical follow -up. Pa rticipants with ongoing pregnancy will be 
managed acc ording to the standard practice at the site, and may include an additional dose  of 
misoprostol, repeating Mifeprex® and m isoprostol, or vacuum  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Those who need additional 
medications will receive either a prescription or referral to another facility. If the participant is referred 
to another facility for a vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_172153], the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_172154], abortion outcome (if relevant), and any AEs or SAEs. N o study activ ities 
will take place at follow -up clinical  visits, althoug h clinical information recorded at these visits will be 
later abstracted from  the patient’s record (see section 9.1 ). 
 
10.4 Day 14 Survey 
 
On Day 14 after the prescription is sent , patient participants will be sent by [CONTACT_172221], 
depend ing on their preference, a link to an on line survey about  their overall satisfaction wi th the 
medication abortion process and to obtain information about  whether the abortion has been co mpleted 
(see Day  14 Su rvey), and whether she has sought care at another facility . If she did obtain care at 
another facility, we will ask for details of the care given to determine if an AE or SAE has 
occurred, and we will follow up with the participant by [CONTACT_172224]. If the participant reports being seen at another facility, we will alert the site PI. If a 
participant prefers, or if she does not  respond to the email link, she may be con tacted by [CONTACT_172225] o r sent reminders by [CONTACT_20815]. If the follow -up for the 
abortion is not yet complete  at the Day [ADDRESS_201933] system of the pa rticipating sites. This

[ADDRESS_201935] a needs assessment focused on  provider  knowledge of medication abortion , 
comfort with dispensing Mifeprex®, and a nticipated ch allenges of d ispensing Mifeprex®. This needs 
assessment will be informal, and  conducted through conversations with the site investigator (s). Each o f 
the providers interested in being involved in medication abortion provision a t the study sites wi ll be 
required t o participate in a training. The training will focus on gaps in knowledge identified in the 
baseline needs assessment, including specifics about the medication abortion protocol, mifepristone and 
misoprostol mechanisms of action, side effects, potential complications and fo llow up. After the training, 
providers will be asked to complete a brief  informal  evaluation, which will serve to improve future 
trainings on the topic.  
 
11.1 Provider interviews  
At the end of the study period, providers will be invited to participate in a 30 -minute in -depth interview 
by [CONTACT_52062]. The interview will explore the providers’ experiences w ith providing 
medication abortion and any challenges faced. Providers who participate in prescribing medication 
abortion to study patients may decline to participate in the interview. Providers will be asked for  oral 
consent to the interview  and consent  to record the interview will be confirmed and documented.  
12   ADVERSE  EXPERIE NCE RE PORTI NG AND DOCUM ENTATION  
 
12.1 Adverse Ev ents 
 
Adverse Events (AEs) are to be reported only for untoward medical events that occur in participants after 
they have enrolled in the study.  Only new unto ward events, or a worsening of an existing cond ition, a re 
considered A Es.  C ondit ions that were present before enrollment into the study, and t hat remain stable or 
improve during the study, are not cons idered A Es.  Only serious or unexpected AEs that are possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the research will be submitted to the UCSF IRB. Diversion of 
Mifeprex® obtained in the study to someone other than the participant will also be considered an AE.  
 
Information regarding AEs or  SAEs m ay be first obtained by [CONTACT_172226], as both will 
communicate with the participant at her visits and by [CONTACT_648].  
 
Details abou t each AE o r SAE will be recorded on an AE/SA E Form . This form will require the 
following information t o be collected:  di agnosis, on set date, resolution date, source of information, 
severity, treatment given, relationship to the study, action taken, and comments. 
 
The physician site PI [INVESTIGATOR_172156], will assess AEs and SAEs, 
and will report them to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_30496], who will then report to the UCSF IRB  as 
Protocol Mife Mail -Order Pharmacy 2021 Confiden tial 
Version #9.0 Version Date: 10/2021  Page 29 of 32

 needed . The site PI, in consultation with the study PI, will determine the relationship of the AE  to study 
treatment as definitely related, p robably related, po ssibly related, or unrelated; and the severity of the 
AE as mild, moderate or severe.  For AEs or SAEs that have not  resolved at  the time of learning of the 
event, the study team and the site PI w ill monitor the event until the event is resolved or has stabilized . 
 
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_172157] (IRBs).  
All AEs that are related to the study and a re serious or affect IRB appr oval will be reported by  [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_172158].  UCSF requires that an internal (on-site) AE that the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_172159] s erious o r unexpected shall be reported w ithin 5 w orking days of 
the UCSF PI ’s knowledge. External (off-site) AE’s that chan ge the study ri sks/benefits or requires a 
UCSF IRB modifi cation must be reported w ithin 10 working days of the UCSF P I’s knowledge.  
Diversion of Mifeprex® will be reported to the FDA within 15 days of the UCSF PI’s knowledge.  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a cau sal relationship with the treatment.  An 
AE is therefore any unfavorable and un intended  sign (including an abnor mal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated w ith the administration of an investigational product, whether 
or not related to that investigational produc t.  An unexpe cted AE is one of  a type no t identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency  in the current Mifeprex® label or of greater severity or freque ncy than expe cted 
based on the information in the label. 
 
The following definitions a pply to adv erse events occurring in clinical studies involving drugs: 
 
•  An AE is any health-related reaction, e ffect, toxicity or abnor mal laboratory result 
that a pa rticipant experiences during the co urse of the study, irrespective of 
relationship to study pr oduct use. 
 
In this study, the following routine study measurements will not be considered A Es 
because they a re anticipated participant outcomes:  
• Abortion 
•  Symptoms associated w ith medication abo rtion (pain, vaginal bleeding, fever, chills, 
nausea, vomiting, heada che, weakness, dizziness and diarrhea), unless they are so 
severe as to meet the criteria for a SAE (see section 12.2 below) 
 
12.1.1   Adverse Event  Sever ity 
 
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE  severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. Tab le 1 below should be us ed to grade 
severity.  It shoul d be poi nted ou t that the term “severe” is a m easure of intensity and that a 
severe AE  is not necessarily serious. 
 
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
 
Seve rity (Toxicity Grade) Description 
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no m edical 
intervention or therapy required. The su bject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. 
Mode rate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or  minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.

Version #9.0 Version Date: 10/2021  Page 30 of 32 
 Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: 12 SEP 2007  
 Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hosp italizations possible. 
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due  to the adverse experience a s it 
occu rred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have cau sed de ath if it were more severe. 
 
12.1.2   AE Relationship to S tudy Drug 
 
The relationship of an AE  to the study drug shou ld be assessed using the following the guidelines in 
Table 2. 
 
 
 
Table 2.  AE R elatio nship to Stu dy Drug 
 
Relationship 
to Drug  
Comment 
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of  the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; and t hat is not explained by [CONTACT_93734]. 
Prob ably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_82978]. 
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a num ber of other factors. 
Unrelated An event that can b e determined wi th certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
 
12.2 Serious  Adve rse Ev ents (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
 
•  Is life threatening or results in death. 
 
•  Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172160]. 
 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
 
•  Is a cong enital abno rmality/birth defect (in the offspring of a pa rticipant). 
 
•  Jeopardizes participant and required medical/surgical intervention to prevent 
serious ou tcome, or 
 
•  Any other event that the investigator considers serious.

 the form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the PI’s files. 
 
14.1 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172164] p rior to meeting 
recruitment targets:  
• If there are [ADDRESS_201939] the inclusion criteria to less than 
57 days’ gestation (instead of 63 days) in order to eliminate the possibility that participants 
receive mifepristone past 70 days’ gestation. We will also investigate all cases of medication 
delivery being deliver ed more than [ADDRESS_201940] the study site to make other arrangements to obtain the mifepristone and misoprostol.  
• If there are 12 cases (3% of total sample) where the participant takes mifepristone after 70 days’ 
gestation, we will  assess the need to  stop the study. All cases of use past 70 days will be 
investigated to understand why they occurred and efforts will be made to ensure such errors do 
not occur in the future . There is evidence that the medication abortion regimen works through 11 
weeks of gestation (Kapp, Eckersberger et al. 2019) ; with regard to clinical safety, this is why the 
research team feels comfortable with 12 potential cases beyond 70 days gestation. Finally, if 1% 
of participants (4 cases) take the mifepristone after 84 days (12 weeks), we will stop the study.  
• Every AE and SAE will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9154], and if there is a pattern of definitely- , 
probably- , or possibly- related SAE/AEs that raise concerns about the safety of the mail -order 
model of dispensing mifepristone, the study will be stopped. Based on evidence that 0.3% of 
medication abortions have serious adverse events (Upadhyay, Johns et al. 2018) , we will stop the 
main study if the number of SAEs fall outside of a 95% confidence interval as estimated in a 
sample of 4 65 (-0.24% to 0.84%)  (minimum sa mple of 440 plus 25 pi[INVESTIGATOR_172165]) . Thus 
we will stop the study if more than 0.84% (n= 4) of abortions result in an SAE  that is possibly or 
probably related to the study intervention.

monitoring and review of AEs and SAEs will occur on an ongoing basis through each participant’s 
involvement in the study (up to 6 weeks from day of enrollment). The site PI, in consultation with the 
study PI, will determine the relationship of the AE to study treatment as definitely related, probably related, possibly related, or unrelated; and the severity of the AE as mild, moderate or severe.  For AEs 
or SAEs that have not resolved at the time of learning of the event, the study team and the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_172166]. B ecause Mifeprex® is already 
approved, and there is a great deal of safety data on its use for this approved indication, w e think it is 
reasonable for safety monitoring to occ ur through the standard review of S /AE reports (see section 12). 
 
As part of routine instruction in the FDA’s Mifeprex® Medication Guide provided to women unde rgoing 
medication abortion, pa rticipants will be instructed to return to the study site or a near by [CONTACT_172227] (more than 2 full-size pads so aked per  hour for 2 ho urs),

 16   STATI STICAL METH ODS  AND CONSIDERATI ONS 
 
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) wi ll be written 
describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifi cations to the analysis 
plan described below. 
 
16.1 Data  Sets Analyzed 
 
All eligible patients who receive the dos e of the study drug will be included in the analysis. All 
eligible providers  who  complete an interview w ill be included in the provider  analysis. 
 16.2 Demographic  and Baseline Chara cteristics  
 
The demographic information that will be collected: Age, parity, race/ethnicity. At the initial visit, we 
will also collect: date of service, gestational age and method of determining gestational age , past 
medical and surgical h istory, current medications, and m edications p rescribed or dispensed. Blood 
pressure, weight, and height will be collected. A ll participants will receive the same dos e of Mifeprex®. 
 16.3 Analysis  of Primary Endpoi nt 
Acceptability and satisfaction with the mail -order model among patients will be assessed through patient 
surveys, which will include some open- ended items. The particular variables we will analyze include 
those on overall satisfaction with the medication abortion service (including whether they would use this 
mail- order medication abortion service again if they needed another abortion, and whether they would 
recommend the service to a friend), satisfaction with receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], reasons for 
dissatisfaction (open ended questions), and perceptions about the wait time to receive the medications. 
We will also analyze the reasons why patients who decline participation in the study report not being 
interested in receiving the medications by [CONTACT_2319], as indicated in close -ended and open- ended responses.  
We plan to recruit for the main study a minimum sample of 44 0 participants  and a maximum of 625 
patients. With the addition of 25 patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the  target minimum number of patients 
recruited for the study is 465 and the  maximum number is 650. 
The sample size calculation for this study is based on two measures  of acceptability: the proportion of 
patients who report they would use medication abortion again if they needed another abortion and the 
proportion who report they were “satisfied” or “very satisfied ” with the medication abortion . For both 
power calculations, we assume 10% loss to follow up, 10% adjustment for clustering, a 5% non-
inferiority margin, and a  two-sided  alpha of 0.05. Research with patients obtaining clinic- based 
medication abortion has estimated the proportion who would use medication abortion again as 89.7% 
(Teal, Dempsey -Fanning et al. 2007) . Based on our assumptions, w ith a minimum sample of [ADDRESS_201942] a final analytic sample of approximately 400 patients , which gives us 79% power to assess 
this measure of acceptability;  with a maximum sample of [ADDRESS_201943] a final 
analytic sample of approximately 560 patients , which  gives us 92 % power.   
A meta -analysis reviewed  8 studies investigating  satisfaction with medication abortion  (Ngo 2011) ; of 
those who had a home -based medication abortion (n=3,138), the average proportion reporting they were 
“satisfied or highly satisfied” was 88.4%. Based on our assumptions , with a minimum sample of [ADDRESS_201944] a final analytic sample of approximately 400 patients, which gives us 77% power to assess this measure of acceptability ; with a sample of [ADDRESS_201945] a final analy tic 
sample of approximately 560 patients , which  gives us 9 0% power.

 Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: [ADDRESS_201946] follow-up data had a successful abortion.  
Effectiveness will be defined as the successful completion of abortion (versus incomplete abortion or 
continuing pregnancy), without vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Continuing pregnancy will be defined as a viable 
pregnancy following treatment  and need for vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_172167] 
a patient elects to continue the pregnancy after failed treatment  (Creinin & Chen 2016) . We will 
document vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_172168], including reasons for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], reported by [CONTACT_172228]-up visits. We will compare effectiveness 
(the proportion of our sample that experiences a complete abortion not requiring vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) with 
published estimates (97.4%) (FDA 2016) , using an exact binomial test.  Assuming 10% loss to follow -up 
and 10% adjustment for clustering, and a  two-sided  alpha of 0.025 (to account for type I error), we 
estimate that a final analytic sample ranging from approximately 400 to 560 patients gives us 98 % to 
100% power to determine that mail- order medication abortion  is as effective as in -person dispensing, if 
effectiveness in the mail -order model is no lower than 92.4%. A non -inferiority limit is defined as -5% 
and as an acceptable difference in the proportion of complete abortions.  
We are unable to similarly assess whether the prevalence of clinically significant adverse events differs 
between the mail -order dispensing model and historical controls given the very low frequency of this 
outcome (<0.5%) (Upadhyay, Desai et al. 2015). A sample size of over 10,[ADDRESS_201947] review, we will thoroughly document women’s 
experiences with any adverse events. In particular we will be interested in documenting adverse events 
that could be related to mail -order dispensing. For example, if the delivery of the medication was delayed, 
which caused a patient to undergo medication abortion after [ADDRESS_201948], and sustainability of the mail -order dispensing of mifepristone and misoprostol, 
will be explored through qualitative analysis of in -depth open-ended interviews . We will invite all 
clinicians and staff who were involved in identifying and recruiting patients, communicating with the mail-order pharmacy, and/or following up with patients about their clinical care in the study, to 
participate in an interview at the end of the study period.

 An interim descriptive analysis may be conducted when approximately half of the minimum sample is 
recruited . Unexpected and seriou s adver se events will be monitor ed as  noted abov e (see section 12). 
 
16.6 Sample  Size  
 
In addition to the 25 patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to recruit a minimum of 440 and a maximum of 
625 patient s for this study, across 15 -20 sites . The sample size calculation for this study is based on a 
measure of acceptability:  the proportion of patients who report they would use medication abortion again 
if they needed another abortion. Research with patients obtaining clinic- based MA has estimated that 
proportion as 89.7% (Teal, Dempsey -Fanning et al. 2007). We would like to determine if acceptability of 
medication abortion when receiving the medications by [CONTACT_172183] 5% lower than 89.7%. Assuming 10% loss to follow -up, with a minimum sample of [ADDRESS_201949] a final analytic 
sample of approximately 400 patients; with a sample of [ADDRESS_201950] a final analytic sample of approximately 560 patients. With a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 and 10% adjustment for 
clustering , a final analytic sample size of approximately 400 gives us 79% power, and an analytic sample 
of 560 gives us 92% power to assess this measure of acceptability.   
 
We aim t o interview  all the providers (or staff administrators) involved in medication abortion provision 
at the study sites, up to 50. Thi s sample size w ill be de termi ned by [CONTACT_172229] /staff  at the

(COPI[INVESTIGATOR_8571] -Simulation)  
 
Principle Investigator: Ithan Peltan, MD, MSc  
 
Purpose of the Study:  Our long -term goal is to improve patient outcomes after in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164132] 
(IHCA) , an event often referred to as a “Code Blue.” The current project will evaluate the effect of 
telemedical consultation by [CONTACT_193778] e care physi cian to assist local IHCA teams.   
 
Research Questions:  Does  remote consultation by [CONTACT_193779] “copi[INVESTIGATOR_48409]” improve the 
quality of resuscitation delivered by [CONTACT_193780] ? 
 
Study summary: We will conduct a multicenter randomized trial using in -situ cardiac arrest simulations 
(“mock codes”) to test the eff ect of adding a telemedical intensivist “copi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]” to IHCA teams on chest 
compression quality, ACLS protocol adherence, team function, and provider experience.  
 
Hypothesis:  Intensivist support of the IHCA team during mock codes improves chest compression qu ality.  
 
Background and Significance: Only 15 -30% of patients who suffer in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164132] (IHCA) 
survive to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].1,[ADDRESS_230220] compressions, prompt administration of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and swift defibrillation of eli gible arrhythmias.3-6 Unfortunately, resuscitation teams 
provide suboptimal care to 25 -40% of IHCA victims, with significant variation in IHCA outcomes and 
process adherence documented between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].3,7 Resource limitations and less -experienced 
providers may exp lain lower IHCA at small hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193756].8,9 Although 
educational and technological interventions ma y improve patient outcomes, the gap between optimal 
and actual resuscitation practice remains large.1,10 Barriers to effective IHCA resuscitation countered by 
[CONTACT_193781]’ ad hoc formation and variable structure and member 
expertise.11-[ADDRESS_230221] Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training provides little instruction non -
technical skills critical for high -functioning IHCA teams.12,14,15 A dedicated, leadership -trained “copi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]” 
on cardiac arrest resuscitation teams may improve IHCA outcomes by [CONTACT_193782]  —

correction — for the resuscitation team leader that an airplane copi[INVESTIGATOR_193757] -

to be filled by [CONTACT_193783] -term cost and resource efficiencies, particularly in smaller hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193758].  
 
Research subjects:  We will conduct mock codes at Intermountain Healthcare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], specifically 
Intermountain Medical Center, LDS Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Riverton Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], The Orthopedic Specialty Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
McKay -Dee Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Park City Medical Center, and American Fork Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
• Local IHCA team: Int ermountain Healthcare employees, resident physicians, and affiliated care 
providers who are either designated members of each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s IHCA response 
COPI[INVESTIGATOR_193754] [ADDRESS_230222] as volun tary responders to announced mock codes will be eligible to participate. 
The number of on-site participants for each simulated IHCA event is expected to average 15-25.  
• Telemedical intensivist IHCA copi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: Board -certified  or board -eligible  critical care m edicine 
physicians on the staff of the Intermountain Healthcare Telecritical Care Center will act as IHCA 
team copi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. The total number of e xpected participants is up to 30.  
 
Recruitment:  
• Local IHCA team: IHCA team activation  will employ  the participatin g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s standard  
mechanism. A sign posted  outside the room used for the mock code will indicate that a video -
recor ded simulation is taking place.  After completion of the simulation, participants will receive 
an information sheet about the study.  
• Telemedical intensivist IHCA copi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: Eligible telemedical intensivists will be invited to participate 
by [CONTACT_193784].  
 
Methods/Procedures:   
• Study design: Randomized, multicenter, simulation -based clinical trial   
• Intervention : Standardized consultation to IHCA  team by  [CONTACT_78150]-site intensivist  via two -way 
audiovisual link using a mobile telemedicine cart  
• Control: Display of silent, pre -recorded, non -interactive videotape of an ICU physician. The on -
site participants will be told that an intensive care physician is observing the mock code.  
• Rando mization: Each  event will be randomly assigned to intervention or control using block 
randomization by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• Procedures:  
o All e vent will be randomly pre-assigned to intervention (participation via telemedicine 
link by a remote critical care physician) or control (prerecorded video of telemedicine 
physician displayed on mobile telemedicine cart).  
o A research coordinator will arrange a time for mock code with l ocal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193759] . The remainder of the IHCA team will n ot be 
informed that the announced event is a simulation prior to team activation.  
o The research coordinator and an experienced simulation technician will set up  
simulation equipment in an unused patient care room on the general medical or surgical 
ward at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , including video recording device and mobile telemedicine cart.  
o Research coordinator will obtain final confirm ation  with the on duty clinical leadership 
that simulation will n ot interfere with patient care.  
o The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s  on duty IHCA resuscitation team will then be activated via the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
standard mechanism.  
o Upon arrival to the room, members of the designated IHCA team and other care 
providers will be informed via a posted sign that the event is a videorecorded resea rch 
simulation. They will then begin participate in the simulation  at their discretion . 
o We will adapt existing, tested cardiac arrest simulation scenarios for use in this study.  
While the provided case histories will describe patients of different ages, g enders, and 
presenting complaints, all scenarios will feature cardiac rhythms demanding 
substantively identical resuscitative actions  (Figure 1) .  
o The telemedical link (or a control video) will be activated by [CONTACT_193785] , whichever occurs 
first. At this time, the coordinator will also provide simple, brief, and scripted “just -in-
COPI[INVESTIGATOR_193754] 10 , 201 7 
 4 time” training to the mobile telemedicine cart and, for intervention events, the 
telemedical inte nsivist copi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  
o For mock codes randomized to intervention, critical care  physicians with experience in 
telecritical care who consent to participate in this study will provide standardized 
consultation to the on -site team. 
These IHCA team “copi[INVESTIGATOR_48409]” will 
advice and assistance to the on -
site team leader including help 
with ensuring high -quality, 
minimally -interrupted chest 
compressions and prompt 
defibrillation, assisting 
situational awareness, 
encouraging etiologic evaluation, 
and promoting leadership 
beha viors.  
o The event will be terminated when team performs an action that was pre -determined 
for the scenario to result in return of spontaneous circulation. The simulation will be 
terminated no later than [ADDRESS_230223] 10 -12 minutes.   
o After simulation termination, participants will complete a brief, anonymo us questionnaire.  
o Local code team leadership and/or the on -site code team leader will lead a debrief of 
the event. As needed, the research coordinator or simulation specialist will facilitate 
discussion of the simulation.  
o In progress mock code simulations  may be terminated by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] -duty hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193760].  
• Mock codes terminated in progress due to competing clinical priorities prior to simulated return 
of spontaneous circulation wi ll be excluded from the final analysis. If this occurs, the simulation 
event may  be rescheduled at the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a later date, with the rescheduled mock code 
assigned to the same study arm as the aborted mock code.  
• If systematic problems interfering with study implementation, data collection, or interpretation 
are identified after study initiation , the study may be halted temporarily while the systematic 
issues are addressed. Affected events where data is invalid will be considered part o f a roll -in 
phase of the study and will be excluded from data analysis. For each assigned to roll -in event 
status , we will schedule a make-up event  at the affected  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Make -up events will be 
assigned to the same study arm as the roll-in event being re placed  and will be interposed  
randomly with other events at the affected study site.  
• Data collection: A research coordinator will be present at all mock codes. Besides study 
implementation duties,  the coordinator will record team composition and function, processes of 
care, and leadership behaviors. Additional data will be obtained from (1) the simulator device, (2) 
the defibrillator device, (3) videotaped recording obtained via the mobile telemedicine carts, and 
(4) a brief questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_193786].  
• The primary outcome for the study will be the fraction of time between activation of the 
telemedicine cart and beginning of the pulse check following the subsequent second full cycle of 
CPR that the IHCA team does not deliver chest compressions ( “no-flow fraction”). Secondary 
outcomes are shown in Table 1.  
 On-site IHCA team members will complete a brief questionnaire (attached) to measure 
the subjective experience of individual and team f unction and — when applicable,

equipment malfunction or simulation termination precluding event analysis for 15% of mock 
codes, we will require 76 completed mock codes (38 in each arm) to achieve 80% power to 
detect a 31% relative decrease (9% absolute decrease) in the mean no -flow fraction.

Data analysis:  
The primary analysis will include completed simulation where CPR quality data is complete and 
non-corruprted. Simulations for which equipment malfunction preclude  measurement of compression 
quality will be  excluded from analysis.  Simulation events where malfunction of audiovisual recording 
equipment or major deviations during simulatio n implementation  prevent accurate evaluation of 
resuscitation team performance and protocol will be excluded from analyses addressing these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. 
Prematurely terminated simulation events and s imulation events classified as  run-in events  will be 
excluded from all analyses.  
Between -group comparisons for continuous variables will employ two -sided t -tests with 
unequal variance. Comparisons for binary or categorical variables will employ Fisher’s exact test or chi -
squared test as appropriate. Given clustering within simulations, between -group comparisons of of 
survey responses will employ multilevel logistic (for binary variables) or linear (for continuous variables) 
regression with a random effect for simulation event. Comparisons of Likert -style variables wil l use the 
rank -sum method described Datta/Satten.28 
 
Sample size/power analysis: Assuming a baseline no -flow percentage of 0.285, a best -case no -flow 
fraction of 0.08 (protocol guidelines advise a single [ADDRESS_230228] compressions for a pulse 
and cardiac rhythm check every two minutes), and equipm ent malfunction or simulation termination 
precluding event analysis for 15% of mock codes, we will require 76 mock codes (38 in each arm) to 
achieve 80% power to detect a 31% relative decrease (9% absolute decrease) in the mean no -flow 
fraction. We therefo re expect to enroll 1900 on -site IHCA team members as study subjects (although 
some participants may participate in >1 mock code).  
 
Waiver of Informed Consent  and HIPAA Authorization  (for on -site IHCA team members) : 
We are requesting a waiver of informed c onsent and HIPAA authorization for on-site IHCA team 
study  participants  of this study . Participation in this study is similar to standard training for IHCA team 
members and involves no more than minimal risk to the subject. Individuals will be notified by [CONTACT_3553] 
a prominently displayed poster(s) that a simulation -based research project with video recording is in 
progress. Such notification will address individuals reasonable expectation of privacy. We will not use 
video recordings for any purposes except research, and digital video recordings will be stored securely 
and then transferred to a secure, approved server of the Intermountain network. We will not 
systematically collect individually identifiable information. The research therefore involves no more  than 
minimal risk to the subjects; the only potential risk is a breach of confidentiality, and protections are in 
place to safeguard the data. Because risk is minimal, the waiver of consent and authorization will not 
adversely affect the rights or welfare of subjects.  ACLS protocol errors of commission, timing and omission

Finally, f or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193769] a public address system, additional ad hoc participation by [CONTACT_193788]. For all of these reasons, we are unable t o identify and consent in advance 
individuals who will participate in simulations. Moreover, including on IHCA simulation teams only those 
subjects for whom advance consent could be obtained would compromise the scientific validity of the 
study and preclud e useful conclusions, as a large proportion of the data would be eliminated if obtaining 
consent were a requirement. Informed consent would markedly increase the response burden for 
participants, thereby [CONTACT_193789].  
Similarly, o btaining consent after IHCA team activation  and individual’s arrival to the simulation 
site but prior to an individual beginning participation in the s imulation is also not feasible. T his would 
preclude the necessarily rapid formation of a IHCA response team and abolish the simulation’s fidelity to 
actual cardiac arrest event, introducing  significant bias into the results and compromising the scientific 
validity of the data obtained.  
On-site p articipants in code simulations will be provided an information sheet about study 
participation at the time the simulation concludes.  
Safeguards will be in place to protect subject identity. The data will be protected from improper 
use or disclosure.  The study data will be kept on encrypted, pa ssword -protected computers.  The data 
will only be accessible to members of the research team, and all members of the research team with 
access to identifiable data have completed Human Subjects Protections training and understand the 
importance of protecti ng subject privacy and confidentiality.  These computers are Intermountain 
Healthcare devices, which are routinely used for storage of patient data and research data including 
subject identifiers. No individual subject data will be presented in any presenta tion, publication,  or 
report related to this research. Data will be presented only in aggregate or as results of statistical 
analyses and will not include any individual -level data that could be traced to a particular subject.  
 
Risks:  Both the off -site co pi[INVESTIGATOR_193770] -site study participants may find participation in simulated IHCA 
events stressful. This expected stress related to the simulation is similar to the stress participants would 
experience during performance of their routine job duties  or routine training related to these duties . 
On-site participants will have an opportunity to discuss their experience during the simulation during 
post -event debriefings.  
 
The only other risk involved with this study is a potential breach of confidentiality.  There is a minimal 
risk of a pri vacy and confidentiality breach. H owever, this risk is low given the secured databases and 
computers that will be employed for data storage.  
 
Benefits:  It is unlikely that there will be any direct benefit to  you as a result of participating in this study. 
Participation in simulated IHCA events may improve the skills used by [CONTACT_193790] -site IHCA team members 
and the telemedical copi[INVESTIGATOR_193771] . Improved 
understa nding of cardiac arrest resuscitation could  improve outcomes for all patients suffering IHCA.

Data Collection:  A research coordinator will be present at all mock codes. Besides study implementation 
duties, the coordinator will record team composition and function, processes of care, and leadership 
behaviors. Additional data will be obtained from (1) the simulator d evice, (2) the defibrillator device, (3) 
review of video  recording  of simulation event , (4) a brief questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_193791], and (5) a brief questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_193792][INVESTIGATOR_2268].

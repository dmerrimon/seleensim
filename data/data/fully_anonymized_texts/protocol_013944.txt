 Objectives of the Study 
 
•  To determine the safety profile, dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of Clostridium novyi –NT ( C. novyi- NT) in humans with treatment-refractory solid tumor 
malignancies when administered as a single intratumoral (IT) injection. 
 
•To document preliminary anti-tumor activity of both the injected tumor and an overall 
response after administering a single IT injection of C. novyi- NT in humans with 
treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies . The evaluation of anti-tumor activity 
will include: 1) a response for the inject ed tumor and 2) an overall response. 
 
•To study the presence of circulating C. novyi- NT spores after administration as a single IT 
injection to humans with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies (see Section 4.1 Study 
Calendar , Table 4  and Section 8.2 C. novyi-NT  detection in circulation and/or abscess 
material/post-dose tumor sample ). 
 
•To measure the host immune and inflammatory response to C. novyi- NT administered as 
a single IT injection in humans with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies.

targeted the inner hypoxic core. The inner core of a tumor has unique characteristics that differentiate 
it from normal tissues. The core has a poor vascular supply and is therefore deficient in nutrients and oxygen. As a site of active cellular necrosis, the lack of a functional vascular supply limits the clearance of noxious cell breakdown and results in a low pH.

[ADDRESS_262102] 
spores of Clostridium histolyticum into tumor-bearing animals3. Remarkably, the bacteria germinated 
only in the necrotic core of the tumor and liquefied it. In the 1950s and 1960s, spores from Clostridium 
butyricum were injected into patients with a variety of very advanced solid tumor malignancies4-6. Many 
patients had significant germination and destruction of large portions of their tumors, but the very poor 
health and advanced stage of these patients made their management difficult and the absence of complete clinical responses subdued further pursuit of this approach. 
1.1 Clostridium novyi -NT 
The agent presented for use in humans in this Phase I study is C. novyi- NT. It was developed after a 
large panel of anaerobic bacteria was screened for the ability to germinate and populate in mouse 
tumor models1. The anaerobe Clostridium novyi (ATCC #[ZIP_CODE]) had the best anti-tumor efficacy in this 
screen. It was subsequently rendered nonpathoge nic by [CONTACT_20683] a clone without the major toxin 
(α-toxin) responsible for systemic toxicities associated with this organism1,7,8. The resulting clone, 
named Clostridium novyi- NT, where the NT stands for non-toxic, was employed in a series of 
preclinical studies based on a strategy termed Combination Bacteriolytic Therapy (COBALT) that 
combined C. novyi- NT therapy with traditional chemotherapy or radiation1,7. 
1.2 Preclinical PK of C. novyi -NT spores9 
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that C. novyi- NT spores, when administered intravenously (IV) to 
mice, are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_218205] (> 99% spores are cleared within 1 hour) and sequestered 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 13 of 67  
 within the reticuloendothelial system. Long-term distribution studies reveal that these spores are 
eventually eliminated from all tissues by [CONTACT_122467]. Delivered in spore form (dormant stage), 
C. novyi- NT germinates (transitions from the spore to the vegetative state) when exposed to the 
hypoxic regions of tumors. Thus, the systemic toxicities of C. novyi- NT have been shown to be greater 
in tumor-bearing than in non-tumor-bearing animals. 
 
1.3 Toxicity Studies of C. novyi -NT in Non-Tumor-Bearing Animals9 
Non-tumor-bearing mice and rabbits showed no clinically  apparent signs (morbidity, mortality, or clinical 
appearance) of toxicity regardless of treatmen t dose administered intravenously. However, 
examination of tissues at necropsy revealed both gross and microscopic inflammatory changes that 
appeared to be treatment-dose dependent. These find ings, primarily in the liver, spleen, and adrenals, 
were noted at doses of 5 x 108 spores/kg or greater. Non-tumor-bearing animals receiving lower doses 
showed no gross or microscopic abnormalities at necropsy. In animals that received high doses, 
resolution of inflammation was evident on Day 28 and all signs of inflammation were absent in all animals by 1 year. To determine if C. novyi- NT spores would germinate in non-tumor hypoxic tissue, 
studies in elderly mice with atherosclerotic plaq ues and experimental myocardial infarctions were 
treated with C. novyi- NT. There was no evidence of spore loca lization or germination within these 
vascular lesions. At the conclusion of the study, no clinical or pathologic abnormalities (other than the pre-existing cardiovascular lesions) were noted in these mice. These studies demonstrated that C. 
novyi- NT is an agent with no clinical and minimal pa thologic toxicity in non-tumor-bearing animals. 
 
1.4 Efficacy and Toxicity Studies in Tumor-Bearing Animals 
Intravenous injection of spores into immune-competent tumor-bearing mice leads to lysis of the tumor and an intense inflammatory response. In mice, on e of three outcomes is typi[INVESTIGATOR_218206]: One 
subset (25 to 35% of mice) are cured (no tumor recurrence after one year of observation) and develop 
long-term immunity to the original tumor
8. Another subset (65 to 75%) demonstrates complete clinical 
responses, but experiences recurrence with regrowth of  the original tumor. The remaining subset (0 to 
20%, depending on the experiment) demonstrates tu mor destruction but develops significant clinical 
toxicity 2 to 5 days after the initiation of therapy.  Relatively simple measures, such as hydration, are 
adequate to reduce this toxicity, often entirely eliminating it9. Studies in larger animals (rabbits) show 
the same cure and recurrence rates with IV C. novyi- NT therapy, but do not show the life-threatening 
clinical toxicity observed in a subset of mice. Tr eatment-related death was observed in tumor-bearing 
mice, but not in rabbits, treated with C. novyi- NT spores9. In these studies toxicity was related to both 
spore dose and tumor size and appeared to be at leas t partially related to dehydration, as it could be 
effectively managed with supportive care (hydration) and/or antibiotics. In moribund mice, no specific clinical laboratory or pathologic end-organ damage was noted and the only significant finding was 
reversible hepatosplenomegaly. Cured mice had rare  remnant inflammatory changes in the liver and 
spleen, but were otherwise no different than untreated animals. These studies show that toxicity in tumor-bearing animals can be pronounced (death) in mice with large tumors, but was minimal in larger 
animals (rabbits), and was manageable in mice with hydration or antibiotics.

 1.5 Exploratory Study of Intra tumoral Administration of C. novyi -NT in Companion Canines 
Bearing Spontaneous, Natura lly Occurring Solid Tumors 
C. novyi -NT has been evaluated in an exploratory and open -label study at multiple veterinary oncology 
centers in companion canines with spontaneous, natu rally occurring solid tumors with tumor histology 
enriched for soft tissue sarcomas (STS). The study  was designed to evaluate multiple cycles of 
intratumoral (IT) injections of C. novyi -NT spores in canines. The study has been completed. Findings are 
summarized as follows.  Study Conduct :  
In this study, 16 companion dogs received between one and four treatment cycles of intratumoral (IT) 
administrations of C. novyi- NT spores at [ADDRESS_262103] received fewer than four treatment cycles due to tumor ablation (2), toxicity (2), or progressive di sease (1). There were 10 males and 6 females with 
average age of 11 years and average weight of 31 k ilograms. The tumor types treated in this study were 
soft tissue sarcoma (13), osteosarcoma (1), melanoma  (1), and mast cell tumor (1). The study follow-up 
period was three months.  
 Safety :  
Most adverse events were mild in severity, with hy perthermia/fever and tumor inflammation being the 
most common AEs expected. All fever events were Grade I or II. Tumor inflammation and abscess 
events, generally considered desired mechanisms of th e treatment, were limited to Grades I or II for all 
dogs but one (who experience d Grade III inflammation).  
SAEs were observed in 25% (4/16) of dogs treated; three out of 4 of  the events were associated with 
tumor inflammation that required prol onged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. It is unclear if the remaining event, cervical 
steatitis causing neck pain, was associated with C. novyi- NT or metastasis given the necropsy findings of 
a melanoma lesion in the fat of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
When comparing C. novyi- NT at 1 x 108 spores/dog IT treatment to 1 x 108 spores/m2 IV treatment in the 
C-100 study, dogs receiving IT treatment experienced far fewer severe AE (Grade III or IV). Twenty-five 
percent (4/16 dogs) receiving IT treatment exp erienced severe AE compared to 57% (8/14 dogs) 
receiving IV administration of C. novyi- NT in the C-100 study.  
 Efficacy:  
The incidence of objective response was 38% and included dogs with soft tissue sarcoma and mast cell tumor. Though debriding was perf ormed in 3/6 dogs with objective response, this procedure was 
undertaken to eliminate necrotic cellular debris and to potentiate the healing of C. novyi- NT induced 
abscesses; complete healing was observed in 2-4 w eeks for all dogs whose tumors were debrided. The 
progression-free rate (at Day 90) was 88%. Four of the eight dogs evaluable at Day 90 had no surgical 
debridement during the study, including one high grade STS - a tumor type and grade not expected to be 
progression-free in 90 days without therapy. 
1.6 Rationale for Intratumoral Treatment of C. novyi -NT in Human Patients 
The favorable risk/benefit profile observed from the preliminary results of the ongoing companion 
canine study with C. novyi -NT IT treatment provides a compel ling rationale for translating the 
intratumoral administration of C. novyi -NT to a Phase I investigational study in human patients with 
solid tumors that are either refractory to standard therapy or without an available standard therapy. 
The Phase I study of intravenous administration of C. novyi -NT spores in patients with treatment-
refractory solid tumors [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] has been closed  so that all efforts could be directed to the 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 15 of 67  
 intratumoral program. The IT treatment protocol will target patients with superficial tumors 
measureable, palpable or clearly identifiable under ultrasound or ra diographic guidan ce and amenable 
to intratumoral injection of C. novyi -NT spores.  
1.7 Management of Adverse Effects Related to Treatment with C. novyi -NT  
 
Local Effects 
As highlighted in the ongoing companion canine studies ( Section  1.5 Exploratory Study of Intratumoral 
Administration of C. novyi-NT  in Companion Canines Bearing Spontaneous, Naturally Occurring Solid 
Tumors ), C. novyi- NT germination can occur within tumor tissues following IT dosing, and may lead to 
tumor inflammation and tumor destruction. Expected inflammatory sequelae may include local 
erythema, warmth, pain, and tenderness near a tumo r injection site. These changes may progress and 
result in tissue abscessation in the tumor lesion. 
 
Preliminary experience from the ongoing canine stud y also demonstrates that tumor inflammation can 
be managed by [CONTACT_218245]. Supportive care during the period of 
time when a localized C. novyi -NT infection is being established can result in successful abscess resolution 
as well as subsequent clinical responses. Similarly, application of antibiotics can be delayed in favor of 
other interventions including, hydration, anal gesia, and abscess lancing and drainage.  
 Systemic Effects  
The current protocol administering C. novyi -NT spores via an intratumoral ro ute is expected to result in 
minimal systemic side effects. However, in order to predict and respond to early signs of systemic 
toxicity, this study will utilize the SOFA score ( Table 1 ) to guide antibiotic initiation.  
 
Validated scoring strategies exist that can predict th e risk of death from systemic insults, including 
infection. Originally developed for stratifying septic  patients, the SOFA scoring system (Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment) has been used to predict mortality10-12. The SOFA score criteria and scoring system 
are shown below. Scores can range from 0 to 24 and are calculated from the sum of the six organ systems evaluated (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, central nervous system [CNS], and renal). 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 16 of 67  
  
Table 1: The SOFA Score (Ferreira et al., 2001.)[ADDRESS_262104] shown SOFA scores are good predictors of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
setting. Scores at time of admission and the highest score achieved during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218207] ( Figure 2 )10. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using admission (initial) and the 
highest SOFA scores for prediction of mortality repe atedly show area under the curve (AUC) values of 
between 0.79 and 0.90, respectively ( Figure 3 )10. Sequential organ failure assessment scores determined 
from the optimal threshold (best cut-off point) to discriminate between survival and non- survival in both 
cases were greater than 8. With scores above 8 pred icting mortality rates averaging 55% (range 26 to 
95%) and those below this threshold averaged 13% (range 0 to 21%).

 Figure 2: Mortality rate in relation to the change s in SOFA scores at (A) time of admission or (B)

Figure 3: Comparison of the area under the ROC curves for prediction of mortality using SOFA 
scores at time of admission or at the high est measured SOFA score achieved during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. (Ferreira et al., 2001.)10 
 
In addition, when applied to bacteremic patients, SOFA scores at time of bacteremia were significantly 
lower in the survivor groups who averaged 7.3 as compared with the non-survivors at 10.0 (p < 0.001)13. 
The best cut-off SOFA score in this group of patients was calculated to be 7.[ADDRESS_262105] every 8 hours or when there is a change in status. Although SOFA scores 
below 7.5 to 8.0 were the derived thresholds to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors, this 
protocol is designed to start antibiotics in a more  conservative manner. Therefore, antibiotics will be 
initiated when: 
 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 18 of 67  
 a. The total SOFA score is 5 or greater; or 
b. The SOFA score in any of the following organ systems reaches 2 (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], coagulation, 
cardiovascular, CNS); or 
c. The SOFA score in either the liver or renal systems reaches 3; or 
d.  A patient is found to have 2 temperatures > 38.5°C lasting >12 hours beginning 5 days following 
administration of th e study agent; or 
e. Initiation of antibiotics is indicated ba sed on the investigator’s clinical judgment. 
 
The decision to start antibiotics will be based on the patient’s progress, temperature and the SOFA score. 
Once the decision to start antibiotics is made, parenteral pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]/tazobactam and oral or parenteral metronidazole will be administered until the patient is  afebrile, clinically stable and has negative blood 
cultures for C. novyi -NT for at least 48 hours. The patient will then receive oral or parental metronidazole 
for 6 weeks (if the parenteral route is chosen, then a temporary central line will be placed) followed by 
[CONTACT_218246] 100 mg orally twice per day indefini tely. Alternate options for antibiotic coverage for 
patients with allergies can be discussed in  consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
 Patients in whom the criteria for starting IV antibiot ics are never met during in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218208] (100  mg orally twice per day)  on Day 7, even in the 
absence of symptoms attributable to  the study agent. Oral doxycyclin e will be continued indefinitely.  
Specifically, Day 7 CT/MRI will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_152567]/her study team prior to patient discharge. If CT/MRI scan indicates evidence of abscess formation, the patient will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218209] (see Sec. 5). If no evidence of abscess is identified, the patient will be discharged 
as planned on PO antibiotics (doxycycline 100 mg orally twice per day indefinitely).
 Supportive care 
measures, including antipyretics, analgesics, fluids and pain control, will be managed by [CONTACT_218247] (PI) and Medical Monitor. In preclinical studies vigorous intravenous hydration appeared to improve outcomes following C. novyi -NT injection in 
tumor-bearing animals. Need for surgical or percutaneous drainage will be assessed in a case by [CONTACT_218248].

17. History of a significant medical illness deemed by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_218211]. For example: 
  i. Symptomatic congestive heart failure 
  ii.  Psychiatric Illness/social situation that may make study dangerous  
  iii.  Unstable angina pectoris 18. Asplenia. 19. Antibiotic allergies that would preclude treatment for a C. novyi -NT infection. 
20. Treatment with antibiotics within 2 weeks (14 days) of dosing.
 
21. Active and clinically significan t systemic or localized infection. 
 
3. Study Design  
Patients who provide informed consent will underg o screening procedures within 21 days prior to C. 
novyi- NT spore administration. Patients will report to the clinical site within 24 hours of Day 0 to 
reconfirm eligibility and for baseline assessments as described in Table 4 . Eligible patients will be 
admitted and enrolled sequentially into a dosing cohort (see Table 3 and dose escalation details below). 
Spore administration will occur on Day 0, and patien ts will remain in-house for observation through Day 
7 (a total of 8 days). Patients may be allowed for an  extended in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218212] a tumor 
abscessation and destruction develops in the treated tu mor lesion site. Patients w ill return to the clinical 
site for follow-up visits at the following time points: Days 11, 14 (Week 2), 18, 21 (Week 3), 25, 28 (Week 
4) and 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_262112]-dose. Assessments of safety, efficacy, and disposition of C. novyi- NT 
will be performed at scheduled time points th roughout the study (see Study Calendar and Table 4 ). 
 
A standard “3+3” dose escalation will be used. Th e following definitions and rules will be employed: 
 
•Toxicity Criteria will be those listed in the Nati onal Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, which is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
•An adverse event (AE) of Grade 3 toxicity lasting thr ee (3) days or longer or Grade [ADDRESS_262113] possibly related to study agent will be considered a DLT. Signs and symptoms of C. novyi -NT infection which are associated with a SOFA score > 5 that 
require invasive intervention including percutaneo us drainage of an abscess or that result in 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (> 5 da ys) will also qualify as DLTs.  
•DLT assessment period is defined as [ADDRESS_262114] patient in a cohort. 
•Toxicity will be assessed from administ ration of study agent up to 8 weeks. 
•The following dose escala tion rules will apply (see Table 2 ):

1 out of 3 Three more patients will be enrolled at this dose level  
• If zero of these three patients experience a DLT, then dose escalati on 
will proceed to the next dose level. 
• If one or more patients suffer a DLT, then dose escalation will stop. 
This dose will be the maximally administered dose (i.e., the minimum  
intolerated dose). Three additional patients will be entered at the 
next lowest dose level (i.e., the MTD) if only three patients were 
treated previously at that dose. 
 
 
> 2 Dose escalation will be stopped. This dose level will be declared the  
maximally administered dose (i.e. the minimum intolerated dose). Thre e 
additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level (i.e., th e 
MTD) if only three patients were treated previously at that dose. 
 
•Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to achieve a total of six patients at that 
dose level if fewer than six patients were treated previously at that dose. 
•Doses will be increased in successive cohorts until the MTD is reached or until complete germination and tumor regression occurs, making higher doses unnecessary. 
•The MTD (or dose at which complete germination and tumor regression occurs) will be the recommended dose for future Phase II C. novyi- NT IT administration studies. 
 
Patients will be closely monitored by a dedicated team of clinicians for infectious complications or other 
treatment-emergent adverse events with the objective of deciding if and when to initiate antibiotics 
and/or additional interventions ( Section 5. Management of Study Agent-related Toxicity ). Patients will be 
followed with serial imaging studies for therapeuti c response. We will observe the first patient in a 
cohort for a minimum of 2 weeks before treating th e second patient, while th ere will be no required 
minimum observation interval before subsequent patients in the same cohort can be dosed. We will observe for a minimum 4-week interval between cohorts. The planned follow-up period for every patient who receives C. novyi- NT will be 1 year. 
3.1 Dosing 
3.1.1 Starting Dose Rationale 
The starting dose (Cohort 1) is 1x104 spores administered as a single IT injection. The starting dose is 
about 700x lower than the Cohort 1 total dose administered in the Phase 1 safety study for intravenous 
injection of C. novyi -NT spores ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in which a starting dose of 1x105 spores/kg, equivalent to 
a total dose of ~7x106 spores, was administered to an average 70  kg patient. The starting IT dose of 
1x104 spores is 10,000x lower than th e IT study in companion dogs ( Section  1.5 Exploratory Study of 
Intratumoral Administration of C. novyi-NT  in Companion Canines Bearing Spontaneous, Naturally 
Occurring Solid Tumors ). 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 22 of 67  
 3.1.2 Dose Escalation Scheme 
Three to six patients will receive IT treatment with C. novyi- NT at a dose corresponding to assigned 
cohort ( Table 3 ), starting with Cohort 1. C. novyi- NT spores will be administered as an IT injection into 
the target lesion. Radiographic guidan ce may be used at the investigator's discretion to aid in targeting 
an area of necrosis in the target lesion. Pati ents will be given IV hydration after dosing.

Dose 
(x 104 spores)  
[ADDRESS_262115], C. novyi- NT spores, are packaged in vials and stored in a refrigerator with 
temperature maintained between 2 – 8 qC. The concentration of spores is   
suspended in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS).  The actual concentration may vary slightly among 
the GMP lots.  
 The investigational drug preparation will occur on the day of administration to the patient. The dilution 
of concentrated spore suspension will be performe d at the time of administration in normal sterile 
saline infusion bags of appropriate size to achiev e the required dose based on dose level in each 
respective cohort. The injectable volume will be 3 mL  and will be withdrawn from the saline bag with 
an appropriate size of syringe (3cc or 5cc) and needle (22-24 gauge). The injection of [ADDRESS_262116], prescribed or over-the-counter, including herbal and other non-traditional 
remedies, is considered a concomitant medication. Prior and concomitant medication use will be recorded for the 4 weeks prior to screening until the final study visit. Antibiotic usage is prohibited 
during the 14 days prior to study agent administration (Day 0). 
 
Concomitant medications will be used for the manageme nt of adverse effects related to treatment with 
C. novyi- NT spores and for the treatment of unrelated AEs. 
 Treatment with antibiotics (parenteral pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]/t azobactam and metronidazole; oral or parenteral 
metronidazole; oral doxycycline) may be needed. Please refer to Section 5. Management of Study 
Agent-related Toxicity  for full details . CCI

A patient will be discontinued from st udy if any of the following occur: 
 
•The investigator withdraws the patient from the study in agreement with the Sponsor and 
Medical Monitor. 
 
•The patient withdraws consent at any time afte r agent administration. Every effort will be 
made to determine why any subject withdraws from the study prematurely. 
 
•The patient is lost to follow-up. A genuine effort must be made to determine the reason(s) 
why a patient fails to return for the necessary visits. If the subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_3652]. 
 
•Disease progression in the injected tumor site ba sed on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_262118]-dos ing. (Caution should be taken in assessing 
progression in the injected tumor prior to 8 weeks since C. novyi -NT germination may cause 
inflammatory changes resulting in “pseudoprogression”.) 
 
•The patient starts a new anti-cancer therapy or enrolls in another interventional clinical trial.  
 
After discontinuation, further radiographic assessment  will not be required and SAEs will no longer be 
reported, unless they are assessed as related or possibly related to C. novyi -NT treatment by [CONTACT_978]. 
Every effort will be made to collect survival informat ion even after discontinuation, including phone calls 
on a quarterly basis for 12 months to the patient, patient’s relatives or primary oncologist. 
 
All patients who withdraw prematurely prior to [ADDRESS_262119] study agent-related mortality. The sponsor may terminate the trial if toxicity observed indicates an unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio.

 4. Study Procedures 
Potentially eligible patients will be referred to the cl inical site staff for study screening by [CONTACT_218249]. Co nsent will be administered by [CONTACT_218250]. The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to 
determine if the patient qualifies for the study. Once the patient is deemed eligible, a date for study 
agent administration will be determined. Patients mu st begin treatment within 21 days of screening.

Monitoring for AEs will occur from the time of informed consent until the patient completes his/her 
participation in the study. The post-dosing observation period will begin with an 8-day inpatient stay (Days 0 to 7). This inpatient stay can be extended and requires that at least 2 days elapse from the 
resolution of any signs of infectio n or serious AEs (SAEs; defined in  Section 6. Adverse Event Reporting  
below) before discharge.  During the inpatient observation period, the patient will be assessed for safety per the schedule of events. Sequential organ failure assessment scoring will be performed every [ADDRESS_262132]-treatment, patients will be 
followed in two ways; all patients will be required to  be evaluated during scheduled visits on Days 11,

Management decisions regarding all day-to-day or emergent matters will be performed by [CONTACT_218251]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_218216]. 
 After spore injection and during the initial 8 days, supportive care measures, including antipyretics, 
analgesics, fluids, and pain control, may be managed by [CONTACT_218252] [INVESTIGATOR_218217].  Initiation of antibiotics will be based on assessment s by [CONTACT_218253]. 
The guiding criteria for initiating antibiotics will be as follows:  
1. A total SOFA score of 5 or greater; OR 
2.  An individual organ system SOFA score of 2 or greater within the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiac, 
coagulation, or central nervous systems; OR 
3.  An individual organ system SOFA score of 3 or greater within the liver or renal systems; OR 
4.  Antibiotics will be initiated if a patient is  found to have 2 temperatures >38.5°C lasting >12 
hours beginning 5 days following administration of the study agent; OR 
5.   Initiation of antibiotics is indicated based on  the investigator’s clinical judgment and regardless 
of the SOFA score. 
 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scor e calculation is described in detail in Appendix 3: SOFA Score 
Calculations . 
 Patients in whom the criteria for starting IV antibi otics are never met during in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218208] (100  mg orally twice per day)  on Day 7, even in the 
absence of symptoms attributable to  the study agent. Oral doxycyclin e will be continued indefinitely. 
Specifically, Day 7 CT/MRI will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_152567]/her study team prior to patient discharge. If CT/MRI scan indicates evidence of abscess formation , the patient will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218209] (see Sec. 5). If no evid ence of abscess is identified, the patient will be 
discharged as planned on PO antibiotics (doxycyc line 100 mg orally twice per day indefinitely). 
 Antibiotics will be administered ac cording to the following schedule: 
 
1. Parenteral pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]/tazobactam and metronidazole until the patient is afebrile and clinically 
stable for 48 hours, switch to 
2. Six weeks of oral or parenteral metronidazole. If the parenteral route is chosen, then a 
temporary central line will be placed after terms in #1 are met, followed by 
3. Indefinite oral doxycyc line (100 mg twice daily) 
 Substitution for any antibiotics can be made for patients with allergy or if intolerance or hypersensitivity develops. Choice of replacement antibiotic will be based on the sensitivity profile of C. novyi- NT, which 
will be provided by [CONTACT_24351](s),  and input from Infectious Diseases as appropriate. 
 
Need for surgical drainage will be assessed on a ca se-by-case basis, and surgical consultation will be 
requested as the case dictates. When surgical draina ge of the tumor is conducted a material sample will 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 30 of 67  be collected for culture and banking. 
6. Adverse Event Reporting 
6.1 Definitions 
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical 
condition in a clinical investigation subject administer ed an investigational medicinal product, even if it 
does not have a causal relationship with that prod uct. Any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of the study agent, whether or not it is considered study 
agent-related will be considered an AE. This includ es any newly occurring event or previous condition 
that has increased in severity or frequency since th e administration of the study agent. An unexpected 
AE is any AE that is not explicitly described in the Investigational New Drug (IND) application, protocol, 
or informed consent document. 
 All Grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory results that represent an increase in severity from baseline will be reported as AEs. A Grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abno rmality should be reported as an AE only if it is 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
•  Results in death.  •  Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the patient is at immediate risk of death from 
the reaction as it occurs; it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might cause death 
had it occurred in a more severe form. 
 
•  Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218218]-existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218219]. This does not include scheduled admissions for 
study-related issues (e.g., inpati ent IT injection of study agent) 
 •  Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 •  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  •  Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered an SAE when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient and may require an 
intervention (medical or surgical) to prevent one of the outcomes listed above as a definition of SAE (e.g., bronchospasm). 
 Clarification of the terms ‘severe’ and ‘serious’ should be made. These terms are not synonymous. ‘Severe’ is a measure of intensity and may describe  a non-serious AE. Intensity is graded as mild, 
moderate, or severe. ‘Serious’ is a term that characteri zes events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or 
important bodily function.

7. Efficacy Evaluation 
Response and progression will be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_190793]  (RECIST) Committee (version 1.1: http://www.eortc.be/recist/ ). 
 
Objective responses will be measured by [CONTACT_218257]. Overall response, based on CT/MRI scan results, will be based on observation 
of measurable and non-measurable disease as co mpared to baseline and nadir in target and non-
target tumors per RECIST 1.1. CT or MRI scans may be submitted to a third party vendor for review.  
 
8. Correlative Studies  
Correlative samples will be collected and stored for up to [ADDRESS_262141]-injection 
site abscess material samples will be collected and stored (for up to 5 years). Archived tissue may be used for correlative studies provided that informed consent from the subject is obtained, or when not 
possible, a waiver of consent is granted by [CONTACT_1201]. Comprehensive information on sample acquisition, 
handling and storage are to be found in the study manual. Sample tube labels should include the 
patient identification number/protocol code, sample number and visit number and will be detailed in the study laboratory manual. Refer to study manual for samples storage conditions at the study center until shipment under appropriate conditions to the third party laboratory vendor and/or sample storage location.  Samples will be used to evaluate the following parameters: 
 
8.1 Measurement of the anti- C. novyi -NT immune and inflammatory responses 
 
The immune and systemic inflammatory responses during C. novyi- NT treatment will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_218258]- C. novyi- NT antibodies, CRP, selected cytokines, and analysis of selected 
immune cell populations in blood. C-reactive protein and certain cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, etc.) are markers of systemic inflammation. Patient whole blood and serum samples will be obtained as 
indicated on the study calendar and, when perf ormed, pre-dose and post-dose tumor samples and 
abscess material will be collected.  
 
8.2 C. novyi -NT detection in circulation and/or ab scess material/post-dose tumor sample 
 
Scheduled whole blood sampling will take pl ace as indicated in the study calendar ( Section 4.1 Study 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 35 of 67  Calendar ) and Table 4 . Anaerobic blood cultures and/or abscess material/post-dose tumor sample 
(when performed) will be assessed to determine the presence (from circulation) of C. novyi- NT. 
 
9. Statistical Considerations 
Before database lock, a statistical analysis plan (S AP) will be issued as a separate document, providing 
detailed methods for the analyses outlined below. Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated clinical study report.  
Markers of systemic inflammation, such as CRP and cy tokines, will be graphed as continuous variables 
over time, and descriptive statistics will be provid ed for these variables. Exploratory graphs will be 
constructed to show the relationship between these responses and their time course.  
Individual patient safety data will be listed. Continuo us safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_218259], and categorical safety da ta will be summarized by [CONTACT_218260]. Shift tables and categorical frequency tables will be presented for safety data as appropriate. 
 
10. Ethical, Legal, and Administrative Requirements 
10.1 Data Recording, Management, and Monitoring

the clinical site(s) and the Sponsor and/or their representative is essential to ensure that the safety of 
the study is monitored adequately. The investigator(s) will make all appropriate safety assessments on 
an ongoing basis. The Medical Monitor may review safety information as it becomes available throughout the study.   All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored with respect to GCP and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable go vernment regulations by [CONTACT_218261]. The 
study monitor will have access to all records necessary to ensure integrity of the data and will review the progress of the study with the PI/local investigator.  
10.2 Access to Source Data/Documents 
 
Data collection for this protocol will be ac complished using electronic data capture. 
 
The local investigator will ensure the accuracy, comple teness, and timeliness of the data reported to the 
Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures  will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A co mplete audit trail will be maintained of all data 
changes. The investigator or de signee will cooperate with the Sp onsor’s representative(s) for the 
periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capture 
system at each scheduled monitoring visit. 
 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 36 of 67  The investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents 
(medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, etc.) 
designed to record all observatio ns and other pertinent data for each patient receiving study agent. 
 The investigator will allow contract designees, author ized regulatory authority in spectors, and the IRB to 
have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study.

Study Agent Development/Purification  
C. novyi- NT is a gram-positive obligate anaerobe rendered nonpathogenic through selection of a clone in 
which the bacteriophage carrying the major systemic toxin ( α-toxin) gene is absent. The α-toxin is the 
major toxin responsible for pathogenicity of this organism, and was eliminated by [CONTACT_218269]. A resultant clone, termed C. novyi- NT, 
was shown not to carry the α-toxin and subsequently used for all pre-clinical work and for Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade agent development for use in humans.  
Packaging/Labeling  
Omnia Biologics, Inc. is responsible for the manufacturing and for the formulation of C. novyi- NT spores. 
The C. novyi- NT spores are packaged in glass vials at a concentration of approximately  
 suspended in sterile PBS and will be labeled with the following information: identity of test 
article, number of particles contained and volume, directions for use, storage requirements, caution statement, lot number.  
Storage and Security Conditions  
Vials of C. novyi- NT spores will be stored at 2-8°C controlled temperature environment under 
constant temperature monitoring with access limited to authorized study personnel. 
 
Study Agent Preparation  
The preparation of the injectable dr ug suspension will take place on the day of IT administration. The 
vial(s) containing C. novyi- NT spores will be diluted using the appropriate volume of sterile 0.9% 
sodium chloride (NaCl). C. novyi -NT spore preparation and dilution will take place in a designated 
biological safety cabinet (BSC) and may be carrie d out at room temperature. The vial should be 
vortexed to ensure an even suspen sion of spores before the appropriate volume of aliquot is drawn 
for dilution. The appropriate volume of spores wi ll be drawn from the vial and added into an 
appropriate size of sterile saline infusion bag for dilution. The resu lting saline bag will be inverted 
multiple times to ensure that the spores are mixed co mpletely with the saline and there are no visible 
particulates.  3 mL of the diluted spore suspension  will be withdrawn from the saline bag with an 
appropriate size of syringe (3 mL or 5 mL) for injection. The proper volume of the concentrated spores 
and the proper size of the saline bag for dilution w ill be determined by [CONTACT_218270], and the exact information will be in cluded in the Investigational Drug Manual. 
 
Study Agent Administration  
The study agent will be administered starti ng with Cohort 1 at a dose of 1 x 104 spores followed by [CONTACT_218271] 3. Study Design . The patient will be given IV hydration after dosing. IV 
fluids and duration are at PI’s discretion. 
 
Study Agent Disposal  
In the event of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_218221], a clean-up protocol exists ( Appendix 2: Study Agent Spi[INVESTIGATOR_218222] ). This protocol and the supplies necessary will be on hand at the time of study agent 
administration. Otherwise, dosing administration su pplies will be collected and sealed in a biohazard 
bag and destroyed. The vial(s) and dilution bag will be destroyed per the institution’s standard for 
biohazard waste.  CCI

The SpO 2/FIO 2 or PaO 2/FIO 2 ratio:  
The PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio can be determined from an arterial blood gas (ABG) or estimated from a SpO 2 
measurement obtained from a saturation monitor. It is important to note that SpO 2/FiO [ADDRESS_262152] 
not been validated for SpO 2 values greater than 97%. Thus, for patients receiving supplemental 
oxygen (more than room air [O 2 in room air = 21%]) the site staff will need to either reduce the 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_218239] a reading to be determined below 97% or perform an ABG to obtain a 
PaO2. (For patients who have a SpO 2 value of > 97% on room air, the site can use the PaO 2 conversion 
value since the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_218240], and any SpO 2 value > 98% while 
receiving room air will yield a converted SpO 2/FiO 2 of > 512). SpO 2 measurements below 90% 
warrant a blood gas evaluation.

“Objectives of the Study”  
The third objective has been modified  
 Changed text:   
To study the disposition  presence of circulating C. novyi- NT spores after administration as a single IT 
injection to humans with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies (see Section 4.1 Study 
Calendar, Table 4 and Section 8.2 C. novyi- NT detection in circulation and/or abscess material/post-
dose tumor sample). 
 
Rationale:  ‘Presence’ is a better terminology since the assays for detection of C. novyi -NT spores are not likely to be 
adequate to document the route of elimination.  Section “1.1 Clostridium novyi- NT”  
First paragraph has been modified.  Changed text: 
The agent presented for use in humans in this Pphase I study is C. novyi- NT. It was developed after a 
large panel of anaerobic bacteria was screened for the ability to germinate and populate in mouse 
tumor models1. The anaerobe Clostridium novyi (ATCC #[ZIP_CODE]) had the best anti-tumor efficacy in this 
screen. It was subsequently rendered nonpathogeni c by [CONTACT_20683] a clone without the major toxin ( α-
toxin) responsible for systemic toxicities associated with this organism1,7,8. The resulting clone, named 
Clostridium novyi- NT, where the NT stands for non-toxic,  was employed in a series of preclinical 
studies based on a strategy termed Combination Bacteriolytic Therapy (COBALT) that combined C. 
novyi- NT therapy with traditional chemotherapy or radiation1,7. 
 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 48 of 67  Rationale: To define NT for clarity.  
 
Section “1.2 Preclinical PK of C. novyi -NT spores9 
 
Changed text:  Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that C. novyi- NT spores, when administered intravenously (IV) to 
mice , are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_218205] (> 99% spores are cleared within 1 hour) and sequestered 
within the reticuloendothelial system. Long-term distribution studies reveal that these spores are 
eventually eliminated from all tissues by [CONTACT_122467]. Delivered in spore form (dormant stage), C. novyi-
NT germinates (transitions from the spore to the vegetative state) when exposed to the hypoxic regions of tumors. Thus, the systemic toxicities of C. novyi- NT have been shown to be greater in 
tumor-bearing than in non-tumor-bearing animals. 
 
Rationale: To provide clarity on the specie s in which the information was obtained.  
 
Section “
1.5 Exploratory Study of Intratumoral Administration of C. novyi -NT in Companion 
Canines Bearing Spontaneous, Naturally Occurring Solid Tumors” 
 
Changed text:  
C. novyi -NT i s being  has been  evaluated in an ongoing exploratory and open-label  study at multiple 
veterinary oncology centers in companion canines wi th spontaneous, naturally occurring solid tumors 
with tumor histology enriched for soft tissue sarc omas (STS). The study was designed to evaluate 
multiple cycles of intratumoral (IT) or intravenous (IV)  injections of C. novyi -NT spores in canines. The 
study has been completed. Findings are summarized as follows.  
 
Study Conduct:  
In this study, 16 companion dogs received between one and four treatment cycles of intratumoral (IT) 
administrations of C. novyi-NT spores at 1 x 108 spores diluted in 100 μL of saline. Eleven out of 16 
dogs received all four treatment cycles. Dogs may ha ve received fewer than fo ur treatment cycles due 
to tumor ablation (2), toxicity (2), or progressive disease (1). There were 10 males and 6 females with 
average age of 11 years and average weight of 31 kilograms. The tumor types treated in this study 
were soft tissue sarcoma (13), osteosarcoma (1), melanoma (1), and mast cell tumor (1). The study 
follow-up period was three months.  
 
Safety:  
Most adverse events were mild in severity, with hyperthermia/fever and tumor inflammation being 
the most common AEs expected. All fever events we re Grade I or II. Tumor inflammation and abscess 
events, generally considered desired mechanisms of th e treatment, were limited to Grades I or II for all 
dogs but one (who experienced Grade III inflammation).  
SAEs were observed in 25% (4/16) of dogs treated; three out of 4 of the events were associated with 
tumor inflammation that required prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. It is unclear if the remaining event, 
cervical steatitis causing neck pain, was associated with C. novyi-NT or metastasis given the necropsy 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 49 of 67  findings of a melanoma lesion in the fat of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
When comparing C. novyi-NT at 1 x 108 spores/dog IT tr eatment to 1 x 108 spores/m2 IV treatment in 
the C-100 study, dogs receiving IT treatment experien ced far fewer severe AE (Grade III or IV). Twenty-
five percent (4/16 dogs) receiving IT treatment experienced severe AE compared to 57% (8/14 dogs) 
receiving IV administration of C. novyi-NT in the C-100 study.  
 
Efficacy:  
The incidence of objective response was 38% and incl uded dogs with soft tissue sarcoma and mast cell 
tumor. Though debriding was performed in 3/6 dogs with objective response, this procedure was undertaken to eliminate necrotic cellular debris an d to potentiate the healing of C. novyi-NT induced 
abscesses; complete healing was observed in 2-4 weeks for all dogs whose tumors were debrided. The 
progression-free rate (at Day 90) was 88%. Four of the eight dogs evaluable at Day [ADDRESS_262155] exposure to C. novyi -NT. 
Subjects may be followed long-term for progression and survival. 
 
Sixteen canines received IT therapy (Table 1 and Table 2). The study revealed that objective disease 
response can occur following germination of C. novyi -NT spores in tumors dosed via IT injection into a 
single tumor. Germination is evidenced by [CONTACT_218276], warmth and tenderness in and around the 
injection site. In a subset of cases, these tumor re actions progress and lead to the formation of tissue 
abscesses and concurrent tumor destruction. Furthermore, robust germination appears to occur in the 
absence of severe syst emic adverse effects. 
 
1.5.1 Study Objectives and Key Eligibility Criteria in Companion Animals   
The objectives of the study include 1) safety evaluation of IT administration of C. novyi -NT spores at 
a dose of 1 x 108 spores per injection per cycle for up to 4 cycles of weekly dosing; and 2) anti-tumor 
efficacy evaluation per RECIST 1.1 guidelines. 
 
Notable inclusion criteria limit eligibility based on tumor size ([ADDRESS_262156] diameter) and 
tumor location (amenable to intratumoral injectio n).  Cases are excluded if they have received 
antibiotics within [ADDRESS_262157] received systemic or local anti-cancer therapy 
within 21 days of enrollment.   
 
Enrolled cases can be treate d with up to 4 cycles of IT administration of C. novyi -NT spores at a 
weekly interval, or at an interval determined jo intly by [CONTACT_218277], Medical Monitor and 
Sponsor based on observed  adverse reactions and/or efficacy foll owing completion of each cycle.

Preliminary Safety Evaluati on in Companion Animals  
An intratumoral dose of 1 x 108 C. novyi -NT spores was well tolerated in cases receiving 1, 2, 3 or 4 
cycles of therapy.  The adverse events (AEs) were almost exclusively limited to Grade [ADDRESS_262160] were consistent with the anticipated tumor inflammatory  reactions resulting from the 
mechanism of action of the C. novyi -NT therapeutic. The AEs were managed effectively following 
clinical management with hydratio n, NSAIDs, and tumor debridement. 
 
Grade 3 AEs were noted in two cases. In one case (#16-R03), Grade 3 diarrhea, tumor swelling and 
lameness occurred within 4 days following the second cycle of therapy. All symptoms were stable and 
resolved over the subsequent 7 days following effective management  with hydration, NSAIDs, and 
tumor debridement. The second case (#10-R01) experienced Grade [ADDRESS_262161] regained full strength over the subsequent 10 days.  
 
A Grade 4 AE was noted in one case (#11-R01).  Thrombocytopenia (Grade 4) was identified at the Day 
[ADDRESS_262162] been evalua ted with a partial resp onse (PR), [ADDRESS_262163] been evaluated with stable disease (SD) , and 3 of 12 subjects ha ve been evaluated with 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014 Page 51 of 67  progressive disease.  A preliminary objective response  rate of 33% (4 of 12 subjects) to-date has been 
observed; these cases are summarized in Table 2. Complete response is difficult to ascertain in the 
short term given changes to tissue via remodeling that may be occurring at the treatment site post 
abscessation.  CT imaging and other modalities may better distinguish healthy versus tumor tissue at 
the tumor site. 
 
In those cases with partial response, the tumor site exuded necrotic or liquefied tissue fragments after 
limited debridement and drainage. Two of the resp onders (04-R03 and 11-R01) were assessed to be 
grossly tumor free at their most rece nt evaluation at day [ADDRESS_262164]-
R03 has no visible remnants of tumor tissue on ex amination. Subject #11-R01 appears to be tumor 
free with only remnants of scar ti ssue on evaluation. Their clinical courses are summarized in Table 3.

Rationale: To provide final findings of the completed canine study. 
 Section “1.6 Rationale for Intratumoral Treatment of C. novyi -NT in Human Patients”  
First paragraph has been modified. 
 
Changed text:  The favorable risk/benefit profile observed from the preliminary results of the ongoing companion 
canine study with C. novyi -NT IT treatment provides a compe lling rationale for translating the 
intratumoral administration of C. novyi -NT to a Phase I investigational st udy in human patients with solid 
tumors that are either refractory to standard therapy or without an available standard therapy. In 
conjunction with the current ongoing The Phase I study of intravenous administration of C. novyi -NT 
spores in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] has been closed so that all 
efforts could be directed to the intratumoral program. T the IT treatment protocol will target patients 
with superficial  tumors measureable, palpable or clearly id entifiable under ultrasound or radiographic 
guidance and amenable to intratumoral injection of C. novyi -NT spores. 
 Rationale: To update the study status of the IV C. novyi -NT trial and to reflect the eligibility criteria 
changes.   
 
1.7 “Management of Adverse Effects Related to Treatment with C. novyi- NT “ 
Second paragraph has been modified. 
 
Changed text: 
 
Preliminary experience from the ongoing canine stud y also demonstrates that tumor inflammation can 
be managed by [CONTACT_218278].  Supportive care 
during the period of time when a localized C. novyi -NT infection is being es tablished can result in 
successful abscess  management,  resolution as well as subsequent clinical responses. Similarly, 
application of antibiotics can be delayed in favor of  other interventions including, hydration, analgesia, 
and abscess lancing and drainage.    Rationale: to provide clarity in the AE management.  
 
2.1 “Patient Population”  
 
Changed text: 
 
The study population is patients with  solid tumor malignancies that are refractory to standard therapy or 
without available standard therapy. Men and women and members  of all races and ethnic groups are 
eligible for this trial. 
 Rationale: To simplify the language for patient population.   Section “2.2.1 Inclusion Criteria” 
Inclusion criterion #1 has been modified.  
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION, BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014  Page 54 of 67

and < [ADDRESS_262167] be no clinical, no 
functional, and no radiographic evidence of bone involvement at the site of the target lesion.     
 Rationale: To achieve greater consistency in the location of lesions injected.  
 Section “2.2.2 Exclusion Criteria”  Exclusion criterion #7 has been modified.  
Changed text:  
Treatment with an investigational drug within the past 30 days or 5 half-lives of that drug , whichever is

 Changed text:   
Antibiotic allergies which  that would preclude treatment for a C. novyi -NT infection. , in the event that 
antibiotics are required.  
 
Rationale: Per the study protocol, all patien ts will receive antibiotics starting D7.  
 Section “3. Study Design” Second paragraph has been modified.  Changed text:   
A standard “3+3” dose escalation will be used.  The following definitions and rules will be employed: 
 
•Toxicity Criteria will be those listed in the Nati onal Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, which is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html 
•An adverse event (AE) of Grade 3 toxicity lasting thr ee (3) days or longer or Grade [ADDRESS_262168] possibly related to study agent will be considered a DLT. Signs and symptoms of C. novyi -NT infection which are associated with a SOFA score > 5 that 
require invasive intervention including percutaneo us drainage of an abscess or that result in 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (> 5 da ys) will also qualify as DLTs.  
•DLT assessment period is defined as [ADDRESS_262169] patient in a cohort. 
•Toxicity will be assessed from administ ration of study agent up to 8 weeks. 
•The following dose escalati on rules will apply (See Table 5  2): 
•Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to achieve a total of six patients at that dose level 
if fewer than six patients were treated previously at that dose. 
•Not more than six patients will be treated at any dose level. 
 PHASE I C. NOVYI -NT IT ADMINISTRATION , BVD-CNV2 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  2, 02SEP2014  Page 55 of 67  •Doses will be increased in successive cohorts until the MTD is reached or until complete 
germination and tumor regression occurs, making higher doses unnecessary. 
•The MTD (or dose at which complete germination and tumor regression occurs) will be the 
recommended dose for future Phase II C. novyi- NT IT administration studies. 
 
Rationale: To clarify that 4 weeks is the required DL T observation period and to  align with the 4-week 
required interval between cohorts (Sec. 3.0). To al low cohort enlargement when indicated by [CONTACT_218279].   3.1.1 “Starting Dose Rationale”  Changed text:   
The starting dose (Cohort 1) is 1x10
4 spores administered as a single IT injection. The starting dose is 
about 700x lower than the Cohort 1 total dose administered in the current Phase 1 safety study for 
intravenous injection of C. novyi -NT spores ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) in which a starting dose of 1x105 spores/kg, 
equivalent to a total dose of ~7x106 spores, is was administered for to an average 70 kg patient. The 
starting IT dose of 1x104 spores is 10,000x lower than the current dose being used in the ongoing  IT 
study in companion dogs ( Section 1.5 ). 
 
Rationale: To reflect the discontinuation of the IV C. novyi -NT study.  
 
3.1.2 Dose Escalation Scheme 
Changed text:   
Three to six patients will receive IT treatment with C. novyi- NT at a dose corresponding to assigned 
cohort ( Table 3 ), starting with Cohort 1.  C. novyi- NT spores will be administered as an IT injection into 
the target lesion. Radiographic guidan ce may be used at the investigator's discretion to aid in targeting 
an area of necrosis in the target lesi on. Patients will be given IV hydration for 2 hours  after dosing.  
 
Rationale:  
To update IV hydration after dosing to be consistent wi th “Table 4: Schedule of Assessments” for clarity.   
 3.1.[ADDRESS_262170] been modified.  Changed text: The investigational product, C. novyi- NT spores, are packaged in vials and stored in a refrigerator with 
temperature maintained between 2 – 8 qC. The concentration of spores is  
spores/mL suspended in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The actual concentration may vary 
slightly among the GMP lots.  
 The investigational drug preparation will occur on the day of administration to the patient. The dilution 
of concentrated spore suspension will be performe d at the time of administration in normal sterile 
saline infusion bags of appropriate size to achiev e the required dose based on dose level in each 
respective cohort. The injectable volume will be 3 mL and will be withdrawn from the saline bag with 
an appropriate size of syringe (3cc or 5cc) and needle (22-24 gauge). The injection of [ADDRESS_262171] sites in the tumor to achieve ad equate dispersal of spores throughout 
the tumor. The injection may be carried out under radiographic guidance.  
 Rationale:  To update packaging information.  To broaden the language to allow the use of alternate injection 
device for C. novyi -NT injection. 
 
Section “3.3 Patient Discontinuation” First and second paragraphs have been modified.  
 Changed text: 
A discontinuation occurs when an enrolled patient ce ases participation in the study, regardless of the 
circumstances, prior to completion of the protocol. The investigator must determine the primary reason 
for discontinuation.  An attempt will be made by [CONTACT_218280], at a minimum, the procedures done at the final visit (i.e., 
the 12 Month visit).   
A patient will be discontinued from st udy if any of the following occur: 
 
•The investigator withdraws the patient from the study in agreement with the Sponsor and 
Medical Monitor. 
 
•The patient withdraws consent at any time afte r agent administration. Every effort will be 
made to determine why any subject withdraws from the study prematurely. 
 
•The patient is lost to follow-up.  A genuine effort must be made to determine the reason(s) 
why a patient fails to return for the necessary visits.  If the subject is unreachable by 
[CONTACT_756], a registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_3652]. 
 
•Disease progression in the injected tumor site ba sed on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_262172]-dosing. (Caution should be taken in assessing 
progression in the injected tumor prior to 8 weeks since C. novyi-NT germination may cause inflammatory changes resulting in “pseudoprogression”.)  
 
•The patient starts a new anti-cancer therapy or enrolls in another interventional clinical trial.  
 
Rationale: To provide more clarity.

Appendix 1: Study Agent Information 
Changed text: 
Packaging/Labeling  
The Johns Hopkins Cell Processing and Gene Therapy Facility (CPGT)  Omnia Biologics, Inc. is 
responsible for the manufacturing and for the formulation of C. novyi- NT spores.  The C. novyi- NT spores 
are packaged in threaded cryovials  glass vials at a concentration of approximately   
spores/mL suspended in sterile PBS and will be labeled with the following information: identity of test 
article, number of particles contained and volume, directions for use, storage requirements, caution 
statement, lot number.  
 
Storage and Security Conditions  
Cryovials Vials  of C. novyi- NT spores will be stored at 2-8oC controlled temperature environment 
under constant temperature monitoring with access limited to authorized study personnel. 
 
Study Agent Preparation  
The preparation of the injectable dr ug suspension will take place on the day of IT administration. The 
vialcryovial (s) containing C. novyi- NT spores will be unsealed and  diluted using the appropriate 
volume of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). C. novyi -NT spore preparation and dilution will take 
place in a designated biological safety cabinet (BSC ) and may be carried out at room temperature. The 
vial should be vortexed to ensu re an even suspension of spores before the appropriate volume of 
aliquot is drawn for dilution. The appropriate volume of spores will be drawn from the vial and added 
into an appropriate size of steril e saline infusion bag for dilution.  The resulting saline bag will be 
inverted multiple times to ensure that the spores are mixed completely with the saline and there are 
no visible particulates.   3 mL of the diluted sp ore suspension will be withdrawn from the saline bag 
with an appropriate size of syringe (3 mL or  5 mL) for injection. The proper volume of the 
concentrated spores and the proper size of the saline  bag for dilution will be determined by [CONTACT_218285], and the exact informati on will be included in the Investigational Drug 
Manual. 
 
Study Agent Administration  
The study agent will be administered starti ng with Cohort 1 at a dose of 1 x 104 spores followed by [CONTACT_218286] ( Section 3 ).  The patient will be given IV hydration for 2 
hours after dosing.  IV fluids and duration are at PI’s discretion.  
 
Study Agent Disposal  
In the event of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_218221], a clean-up protocol exists ( Appendix 2: Study Agent Spi[INVESTIGATOR_218222] ).  This protocol and the supplies necessary will be on hand at the time of study agent 
administration.  Otherwise, dosing administrati on supplies will be collected and sealed in a 
biohazard bag and destroyed. 
The vialcryovial (s) and dilution bag will be destroyed per the institution’s standard for biohazard 
waste.  
 
Rationale: To update manufacturing location and pack aging information.  To up date IV hydration after 
dosing to be consistent with “Table 4: Schedule of Assessments” for clarity.   CCI

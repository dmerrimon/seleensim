Statistical methods The analysis for PoCC and dose-finding will be performed using 
multiple comparison and modelling techniques (MCPMod) whereby [CONTACT_195873] (patterns) will be evaluated, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_517353] I error at 2.5% (one-sided) to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models. A plausible and diverse range of monotone dose response patterns will be used for this purpose, with placebo mean response assumed to be zero and the mean response at the highest BI 456906 dose assumed to be -10.0 (i.e. a percentage reduction from baseline in body weight of 10%).A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis will first be carried out. The MMRM will include fixed effects for baseline body weight and baseline by [CONTACT_517375], and treatment, gender, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors. Unstructured covariance will be used to model the relationship between pairs of endpoint measurements taken at different visits on the same patient. Adjusted mean percentage change in body weight at Week [ADDRESS_670498] controlled for the family–wise type I error rate at one sided α = 2.5%. If PoCC is 
established, the statistically significant (best fitting) model(s) from the above candidate set will be refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters from the data. The target dose(s) will be estimated from the best fitting model(s) by [CONTACT_195910]. The primary analysis of percentage change from baseline in body weight at Week 46 will be performed using the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and who have analysable data for at least 
one efficacy endpoint. Patients will be assigned to the randomised 
maintenance dose. The analysis will include all available data without regard to whether patients started the maintenance period with a lower dose than the one randomised to. For patients who discontinued treatment early, a distinction will be made according to whether this is due to a COVID-[ADDRESS_670499] data handled after discontinuation as if they were missing (hypothetical strategy).

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Obesity is a chronic, complex, heterogeneous disease caused by [CONTACT_517379]. Obesity substantially 
increases the risk of metabolic diseases (for example type 2 diabetes mellitus and fatty liver 
disease), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke), musculoskeletal disease (osteoarthritis), Alzheimer disease, depression and some types of cancer (for example, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney and colon). In addition, obesity can lead to reduced quality of life, employment disparities, lower productivity and social disadvantages. For example, osteoarthritis — a common consequence of obesity — is one of the leading causes of disability and early retirement. Importantly, the World Obesity Federation and other organizations, including the American and Canadian Medical Associations, have declared obesity a chronic progressive disease clearly distinct from being a risk factor for other diseases and suggest that weight loss can improve these outcomes[R20-1944 ].
Obesity was previosly regarded solely as a lifestyle or behavioural disorder caused by 
[CONTACT_517380]; however, current evidence suggests that obesity is caused by a disruption of homeostatic control of body weight and a failure to maintain constant body fat mass. Regulation of physiological body weight set point involvesnumerous arrays of central nervous system circuitry and peripheral metabolic feedback signals of either energy abundance or deficit, influenced by a  of genetic, developmental, biological, environmental, behavioural and iatrogenic factors. The abnormal regulation of body weight triggers a biological resistance to weight loss and a predisposition to weight gain. Currently, there are four major FDA-approved medications for chronic weight management: orlistat, phentermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_298726] (ER), naltrexone sustained release (SR)/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_517355], however those medications only provide modest reduction of body weight. Most of these drugs work through CNS pathways that either reduce appetite or enhance satiety, with the exception of orlistat, which decreases the absorption of fat [R20-1943 ]. Considering neurobiological resilience to energy homeostatic perturbations, 
combined with the heterogeneous pathophysiology of human metabolic disorders, targeting 
of multiple signalling pathways (including CNS and peripheral organs) is probably necessary. This will help patients with obesity to achive more significant improvements in weight management and might reverse the progression of these metabolic disorders and related co-morbidities. 
Targeting multiple pathways has become a standard treatment strategy in other 
diseases such as T2DM, hypertension, heart failure. It is anticipated that obesity will prove no 
different, with simultaneous activation of multiple target mechanisms, i.e. anorectic and 
thermogenic pathways, producing enhanced metabolic benefits such as improved glucose 
intolerance and lipid metabolism thereby [CONTACT_517381]-morbidities.

It is expected that the increased energy expenditure will contribute to a longer lasting negative energy balance than GLP1-R agonism alone, while achieving a favourable benefit/risk profile ( c14085752-05 )

Rates of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea appeared to be dose dependent for GLP-  agonists, and the proportion of patients reporting nausea was 20% lower in patients with dose escalation than without dose escalation [ R17-4311 ].
Accordingly, for a number of compounds of this class it has been shown that dose escalation 
steps are able to significantly improve tolerability in clinical practice. Cardiac conduction disorders were described for GLP-1R agonists in clinical trials and in the prescribing information for Saxenda [ R19-1407 ], reported as first-degree atrioventricular 
block, right bundle branch block, or left bundle branch block, as well as QT-prolongation. 
BI 456906 has been studied in healthy volunteers in a single rising dose trial (1404-0001). 
Similar to other GLP-1 agonists, nausea and vomiting were seen with increasing doses up to 1.2 mg and the study was discontinued early due to severe nausea and vomiting in a number of healthy volunteers. BI 456906 has also been studied in otherwise healthy volunteers with obesity or overweight 
in a multiple rising dose trial ( c21168858-06 ) with dose escalation to investigate the safety 
and tolerability of different dose escalation schemes to determine a dose escalation scheme 
that minimizes gastrointestinal adverse events. Data from the completed 6-week MRD trial
(c21168858-06 ) where BI 456906 was administered in 4 different escalation schemas (one 
once-daily dose group and 3 once-weekly dose groups, all with weekly dose escalation) were 
analysed. The most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, in participants who received BI [ADDRESS_670524] of the reported GI AEs were transient, mild or moderate in intensity. Severe AEs of gastrointestinal disorder were reported for 9 out of 45 patients treated with BI 456906. No deaths, SAEs, or protocol specified AESIs, were reported in this trial to date. 
For a more detailed description of the BI 456906 profile, please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

safety. Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_670530] of the reported AEs were transient, and mild or moderate in intensity. To date, one Always serious AE from study 1404.3 occurred. It was reported as‘paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differential diagnosis ventricular tachycardia’. A 24-hour ECG (Holter Monitor) recorded from the subject at baseline (the subject had not received any dose of BI 456906) identified isolated polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles, a ventricular salve (9 beats), isolated supraventricular extrasystoles, and a supraventricular salve (4 beats). The Holter (V6/D5) used for diagnosis of the above events confirmed these findings. Initially, the investigator assessed the event as not serious. However, the event was recently upgraded to serious due to the medical significance, according to the BI Global Pharmacovigilance case processing procedure linked with the new version of the ‘Always Serious Events List’ that was implemented on 04 May 2020 and in which the event Ventricular Tachycardia was included. No deaths, or protocol specified AESIs, were reported.Overall, the potential benefits, coupled with an acceptable safety profile and a well-controlled clinical trial environment support the initiation of the trial.

The overall purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy on weight loss and maintenance, and tolerability of four different doses of BI 456906 compared to placebo in patients with obesity or overweight (BMI ≥ 27kg/m
2), without type [ADDRESS_670532] the target dose(s) for 
phase III clinical development. The results of this dose-finding study will serve as Proof of Clinical Concept in patients with obesity or overweight.
2.1 MAIN OBJECTIVES, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
2.1.1 Main objectives
This trial will characterize the dose response curve for BI 456906 in patients with BMI ≥ 27 
kg/m

The primary treatment comparison will be randomised, without regard to whether patients 
discontinued treatment early (and whether they subsequently received any permitted anti-obesity treatments), or whether patients started the maintenance period with a lower dose than the dose that they were randomised to.
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint is:
- Percentage change in body weight (%) from baseline to week 46
2.1.3 Secondary endpoint(s)
Secondary endpoints are:
- Weight loss of ≥5% of baseline weight at week 46
- Weight loss of ≥10% of baseline weight at week 46
- Weight loss of ≥ 15% of baseline weight at week 46 
- Absolute change in body weight (kg) from baseline to week 46- Absolute change in waist circumference (cm) from baseline to week 46- Absolute change in systolic blood pressure (mmHg) from baseline to week 46- Absolute change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) from baseline to week 46

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN 
This is a 46 week randomised, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled, multi-
national and multi-centre study with 4 different maintenance doses (ranging from 
0.6mg/week to 4.8mg/week) in patients with obesity or overweight (BMI ≥ 27kg/m2), and 
without diabetes. Patients in all treatment arms including placebo will receive counselling for a reduced-calorie diet with an energy deficit of approximately 500 kcal/day by a dietician, as well as increased physical activity counselling (recommended minimum 150 minutes/week) by a qualified person on a monthly basis.
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 active dose arms of BI 456906 or 
placebo at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio.
The different treatment arms and the dose escalation scheme are presented in Table 4.1.4:1 .
There will be a screening period of minimum one week (time needed to obtain all 
examination results), that could be extended up to 12 weeks as needed to check eligibility criteria. The lab criteria “at screening” remain sufficient for checking lab eligibility criteria at randomisation. 
The treatment duration is 46 weeks in total including a dose escalation phase of 20 weeks to 
minimize GI side effects of BI 456906. This is followed by a 26-week maintenance phase, and a 3-week ([ADDRESS_670537] dose) follow-up period.
Figure 3.1:1  Dose escalation scheme 
Screening period: Minimum 1 week, and up to 12 weeks maximum
Randomisation period: 
- Dose escalation phase: up to 20 weeks (see section 4.1.4 )
- Maintenance phase: 26 weeks
Follow up: [ADDRESS_670538] drug injection
One interim analysis will be performed during the trial. Please refer to section 7.2.7

3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A sufficient number of patients will be screened to ensure that an adequate number of 
patients will be randomized.A total of 350 patients in approximately 45 sites, 13 countries will be randomised. More sites may be initiated depending on recruitment rate. To ensure sufficient enrolment of men, recruitment of women will be capped at 70 % and the randomisation will be stratified according to sex.Screening of patients for this trial is generally competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. The sponsor may require some site or country to stop recruitment in case they dominate the recruitment in a way that might cause variety or quality issues. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial.A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is enrolled in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria on the day of enrolment), the sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_15608].
Re-screening is not allowed. Re-testing (of assessments) should be discussed with Clinical 
Trial Manager (CTM). 
Re-testing: 
If the investigator believes that an ineligible lab test result is the result of an error or extenuating circumstance, then that lab test can be retested once without the patient having to be re-screened. The retest should be carried out as soon as possible so the laboratory test results will be received within the next planned visit windows in order to avoid protocol window violations. 
Patients must have had a stable weight for 3 months before entering the trial. If this criterion
cannot be documented, it is possible to extend the screening period up to 12 weeks to allow checking the weight stability. Documentation upon patients’ interview is acceptable. 
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
The main diagnosis for patients to enter the trial is BMI ≥27 kg/m
2without diabetes at 
screening.
Please refer to section 8.3.1 (Source Documents) for the documentation requirements 
pertaining to the in- and exclusion criteria.

Pregnancy
If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, the trial medication will be stopped, the patient
will be followed up during the trial and until birth or termination of the pregnancy (see furtherdetails in section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). The patient will be expected to attend the regularly scheduled 
study visits as outlined above.
There is no evidence of risk for partners of male participants, thus no need for male contraception.
Malignancies
In case of occurrence of malignant neoplasm, the Investigator should discontinue treatment 
with the trial medication, and notify the Sponsor. Diagnostics and treatment should be initiated according to local standard of care.
Suicidality
In case of signals of suicidal ideation or behaviour, the Investigator should discontinue 
treatment with the trial medication, notify the Sponsor and the patient should be referred to an appropriate psychiatric clinic.If new efficacy/safety information becomes available, Boehringer Ingelheim will review the benefit-risk-assessment and, if needed, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all patients or take any other appropriate action to guarantee the safety of the trial patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of consent to trial participation
Patients may withdraw their consent to trial participation at any time without the need to 
justify the decision.If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion with the patient and explain the difference between trial treatment discontinuation and withdrawal of consent to trial participation, as well as explain the options for continued follow-up after trial treatment discontinuation, please see section [IP_ADDRESS] above.

Maintenance dosing phase (week 21- week 46)  
No dose adjustments or titrations will be allowed during the maintenance phase. No patients 
will start the maintenance phase at week 21 with any dose which is not one of the planned maintenance doses (0.6, 2.4, 3.6 or 4.8mg), and the dose will not be changed from week 21 until the final study visit at week 46.

If 2 consecutive doses of study medication are missed, the patient may recommence the study treatment if considered safe as per the investigator’s discretion and the patient does not meet any of the discontinuation criteria”.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical visits to the sites may need to be restricted to ensure patient safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the investigator may still decide to continue the trial treatment and trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if acceptable according to local law and regulations, for more details see section 6.2.2
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patients, investigators, central reviewers, and everyone involved (except as noted below) in
trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after database lock.
The DMC will be provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review safety and to 
fulfil their tasks as outlined in the data monitoring committee charter. An independent team, not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, will provide the unblinded results to the DMC.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics during the course of the trial to 
allow for the exclusion from the analyses of pharmacokinetic (PK) and antidrug antibodies (ADA) samples taken from placebo patients. Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurements until the trial is officially unblinded.
One interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_517388] 20. Details are given in Section 7.2.7 , including how 
access to unblinded data and results will be controlled.
The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.The ECGs do not represent a risk of unblinding.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only be used in
an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must be known to the investigatorin order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trial

Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the PV database system and not be shared further. 
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by [CONTACT_23292] a designated CRO. Syringes 
will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Re-supply to the sites will be managed via an IRT system, which will also monitor expi[INVESTIGATOR_15567].For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.

RESTRICTIONS
4.2.1 Other treatments and emergency procedures
[IP_ADDRESS] Diet and physical activity counselling 
During the trial, subjects in all treatment arms including placebo will receive diet and 
physical activity counselling every month. Patients will be given an e-diary in which they will keep tracking their level of activity everyday as well as a paper diary to track their daily dietary compliance. The subject’s dietary compliance and the average daily level of physical activity will be evaluated and recorded every month by [CONTACT_517389] e-CRF
Diet Counselling
At visit 2 (randomisation) subjects will receive diet counselling by a dietician or equivalent 
qualified delegates according to local standard with an energy deficit of approximately 500 kcal/day compared to the subject’s estimated total energy expenditure (TEE).[ R20-2315 ]
TEE = Basal metabolic rate (BMR) x Physical activity level (PAL) of 1.3 
The hypocaloric diet is to be continued after randomisation and throughout the treatment 
period. The TEE should be re-calculated at regular intervals based on the changes in body weight and daily physical activities during the treatment period. If a BMI ≤ 22 kg/m

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
5.1.1 Anthropometry 
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight measurement
It is important to minimise variability in body weight measurement. On site, weight 
measurements should be done on the same scale for one patient throughout the course of the trial (mechanical and digital scales are acceptable), and the equipment must be calibrated according to the directions for use and at a minimum once a year. Weight should be recorded with one decimal (kg)In order to get comparable body weight values, shoes, coats/jackets, and any headgear should be taken off, and pockets should be emptied of heavy objects (i.e. keys, coins etc.). Headgear worn for religious reasons are acceptable, but this should be consistently worn for all weight measurement in the trial. Patient should empty the bladder before weight is measured. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Self-measurement of body weight at home
All patients will be provided a scale for use at home during the trial for self- measurement of 
body weight. Patients must use the provided scale for all home weight measurements and 
measure body weight on a weekly basis. The body weight should be measured with an empty 
bladder, without shoes and only wearing light clothing, in fasting state at the same time of the day, preferably morning fasting time, throughout the trial. The measure is then recorded in an eDiary.
[IP_ADDRESS] Height 
Height is measured at screening without shoes in centimetres (one decimal) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Body mass index (BMI)
Body mass index will be calculated within the eCRF from visit 1 (screening) data.
[IP_ADDRESS] Waist measurement
Waist circumference measurements should be made around a patient’s bare midriff, after the 
patient exhales while standing without shoes and with both feet touching the ground and arms hanging freely. The measuring tape should be made of a material that is not easily stretched.The tape should be placed perpendicular to the long axis of the body and horizontal to the floor and applied with sufficient tension to conform to the measurement surface. Waist circumference should be measured against the skin, at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest.

from baseline or any other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified, the investigator will assess the symptoms (e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], near syncope, and syncope) and decide if the patient will continue in the study. The investigator must also ensure that patient does not meet any criteria for discontinuing study treatment (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ), such as tachycardia, arrhythmia or conduction disorders. Any new findings 
or deterioration of previous findings observed during the trial will be recorded as AEs/SAEs

Additionally, all C-SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type [ADDRESS_670586] be reported as separate SAEs by [CONTACT_093]. For ‘Self-injurious behaviour, no suicidal intent’ (Type 11) standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be applied. For each negative report (suicidal ideation type 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the investigator is to decide based on clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the protocol, and if it is considered an AE then it must be reported accordingly.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_517368] 29 Apr 2022

In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Adverse Event (AE) coded shall cross referenced against the Always Serious List (ASL). 
Non serious cases will be upgraded to serious. Cardiac related events included in the ASL, shall be fully processed as serious and expedited
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in [IP_ADDRESS] , subsections “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_670589] (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by [CONTACT_35961]: 
∀an elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold
ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, or

[IP_ADDRESS].6 Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
As GI and cardiac AEs have been shown to be associated with pharmacological doses of
GLP-1R agonists and glucagon, the intensity of such AEs is defined as follows for thisclinical trial:

∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.

all AEs (serious and non-serious) and all AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s end of study: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should only report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), but not on the CRF.
Vital Status Data Collection
Patients who discontinue trial medication prematurely, who agree to be contact[CONTACT_517391], should be followed up as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] , 
withdrawal from trial treatment. From then on until the individual patient’s end of the trial the 
investigator must report all deaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs the investigator becomes aware of. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_670597] report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately (within 24 hours ) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific contact [CONTACT_15626]). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions,the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable”, or no further information can be obtained.

As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.

5.5 BIOBANKING
Participation in biobanking is voluntary and not a prerequisite for participation in the trial.
Biobanking will only occur after a separate biobanking informed consent has been given inaccordance with local ethical and regulatory requirements. No samples will be taken for biobanking from patients at sites in China due to regulatory restrictions.
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily
donate biospecimens for banking. If the patient agrees, banked samples may be used forfuture biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to identify patients that aremore likely to benefit from a treatment or experience an AE, or to gain a mechanistic orgenetic understanding of drug effects and thereby [CONTACT_195883][INVESTIGATOR_014].Samples will be stored for testing for a period consistent with local regulations.
5.5.1 Methods and timing of sample collection
Detailed instructions on sampling, preparation, processing, shipment and storage are provided 
in the laboratory manual. For sampling timepoints see Flow Chart .
Approximately 48 mL blood will be drawn for DNA, Plasma, and Serum banking.

After giving his/her Informed Consent, the patient will be screened for inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for the study at visit 1. Visit 2 will be scheduled after visit 1, after results from central laboratory are obtained, as well as ECG central review. The minimum interval between screening and randomization is 1week. The patient will be randomized at visit 2 if all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are fulfilled.During the treatment period, there will be a dose escalation period of 20 weeks followed by a dose maintenance period. Total treatment period is 46 weeks.
Windows of ±1 or ±2 days is allowed to accommodate scheduling problems. If a delay is 
observed for a particular visit, the original calendar schedule should be kept for subsequent visits (delays should not accumulate). If a visit is missed the patient should be instructed to reach out to the investigator as soon as possible. Handling of missed drug injections is described in section 4.1.[ADDRESS_670603] may need to be adjusted, strictly consistent with local public 
health guidance and regulations.If, in order to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, physical visits should be avoided , the use of remote visits (via phone and/or internet-based means of communication) and local laboratory services for safety and efficacy parameters measurements should be considered if possible.

Considering all aspects, the investigator will decide upon each patient’s (continued) 
participation in the planned trials. BI as the sponsor, where required, will support the investigator in their decision finding. It is acknowledged that the investigator may decide to implement protocol deviations where this protects the safety, wellbeing and/or is in the best interest of the patient. All home/remote visits need to be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_456]`s trial team. Local regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country still applyAll COVID-19 related deviations from the original schedule of visits and procedures will be documented and the implications considered for the analysis of the trial data.

6.2.1 Screening and run-in period(s)
Screening Period
Following informed consent, the patient will undergo visit 1/screening assessments as 
indicated in the Flowchart . Once the patient has consented, the patient is considered to be 
enrolled in the trial. The patient should be recorded on the enrolment log and be registered in 
the IRT.The assessments must all fall within the acceptable screening visit window but do not need to be performed on the same day.
Re-testing for certain eligibility criteria can be performed once as outlined in section 3.3 . 
The screening phase can be extended up to a maximum of 12 weeks (from visit 1 to visit 2), 
when needed to allow proper documentation of weight stability. If the patient meets the entrycriteria, visit 2 should occur as soon as possible once it has been confirmed that the patient iseligible to continue.If the patient does not meet the entry criteria, (i.e. fail to meet one or more of the inclusioncriteria, and/or meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) following Visit 1 procedures, they should be registered as a screen failure in IRT.
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Before visit 2, patients will have to record their food intake in a 3-days food diary (see 
section 5.1.5 ). 
Patients who meet all the protocol criteria will be randomized at visit 2. After randomization, 
patients will start the treatment period which includes a dose escalation phase, followed by [CONTACT_517392] 3.1: [ADDRESS_670605] 10 hours without food intake.  Water intake is allowed. On days when fasting is required, the clinic visit should ideally be scheduled in the mornings, if this is convenient for the patient.

7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
Analysis Sets
Statistical analysis will be based on the following analysis sets: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomised patients who received at least one 
dose of study treatment and who have analysable data for at least one efficacy endpoint.
The Treated Set (TS) is defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of 
study treatment.
The Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS) is defined as all patients in the TS who provided at least one 
BI 456906 concentration which was not excluded due to non-evaluability or an important protocol deviation relevant for PK. 
Important Protocol Deviations
Important protocol deviation (IPD) categories will be defined in the IPD specification 
document. IPDs will be identified no later than in the Report Planning Meeting (RPM).
IPDs may include (but not necessarily be limited to) the following:
∀Violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria
∀Major deviations from scheduled timing of assessments
∀Non-compliance with trial medication

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_670612]-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019∀Treatment dispensing errors
∀Use of prohibited or restricted concomitant medication.
Definition of baseline
In general, unless otherwise specified in the TSAP, the last non-missing measurement on or 
prior to the date of first dose of study treatment will be used as baseline for efficacy and safety variables. 
Definition of on-treatment
For the purposes of on-treatment efficacy analyses, the definition of “on-treatment” will be 
given in the TSAP.
For the purposes of on-treatment safety analyses, an assessment (or AE start date) will be 
considered “on-treatment” if the assessment date (or AE start date) is between the date of first dose and [ADDRESS_670613] dose of study treatment.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
The analysis for PoCC and dose-finding will be performed using multiple comparison and 
modelling techniques (MCPMod) [ R10-1424 ] whereby [CONTACT_417825] (patterns) will be evaluated, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_517353] I error at 2.5%
(one-sided) to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models. 
To account for repeated body weight measurements over time and for inclusion of baseline 
covariates in the model, a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis will first be 
carried out. The MMRM will include fixed effects for baseline body weight and baseline by [CONTACT_517375], and treatment, gender, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors. Unstructured covariance will be used to model the relationship between pairs of endpoint measurements taken at different visits on the same patient. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The TSAP will specify approaches to be taken to resolve possible non-convergence issues, including if necessary, the selection of a simpler covariance structure.
Covariate-adjusted fixed effect estimates of mean percentage change in body weight at Week 
[ADDRESS_670614] be pre-defined. The following model assumptions and resulting graphs ( Figure 7.2.2: 1 ) have been selected to cover a plausible and diverse range of 
monotone dose response patterns, with placebo mean response assumed to be zero and the 
mean response at the highest BI 456906 dose assumed to be -10.0 (i.e. a percentage reduction from baseline in body weight of 10%):

For patients who discontinued treatment early, a distinction will be made according to whether this is due to a COVID-19 pandemic-related reason or not. Patients who discontinued treatment early due to a pandemic-related reason (e.g. direct COVID-19 infection, drug supply issue, site closure, quarantine preventing site access) will have data handled after discontinuation as if they were missing. Patients who discontinued treatment early for any other reason will have all available data included after discontinuation, irrespective of whether such patients subsequently received any permitted anti-obesity treatments.
The above approach to the primary analysis specifies a hypothetical strategy for the 
intercurrent event of pandemic-related early treatment discontinuation, and a treatment policy strategy for the intercurrent event of non-pandemic-related early treatment discontinuation.
The primary endpoint will be summarised descriptively overall, and by [CONTACT_094]-specified 
subgroups (to be specified in the TSAP, but which may include e.g. subgroups based on gender, baseline BMI and age at screening).
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
The responder secondary endpoints (percentage change from baseline < -5.0% and < -10.0%
in body weight at Week 46, respectively) will be summarised descriptively. 
Logistic regression with treatment group and gender as factors and baseline body weight as a 
continuous linear covariate will be used to estimate the odds ratio for each active BI 456906 dose compared with placebo, and to provide covariate-adjusted estimates of the proportion of responders at each BI 456906 dose.

the underlying continuous endpoint to generate multiple imputed datasets, each one containing complete data for every patient. A minimum of 100 imputed datasets will be used for this purpose. The imputation model will assume that a patient with missing data follows a similar trajectory to a patient without missing data in the same treatment group (with similar baseline covariates and observed values). The responder endpoints will be derived from the complete data in each of the imputed datasets, and then analysed using the logistic regression model specified above. Finally, the estimates from the logistic regression model will be combined across the imputed datasets in a way which correctly accounts for the within and between imputation variance. Further technical details of the multiple imputation will be provided in the TSAP.
Continuous secondary endpoints measured repeatedly over time will be summarised 
descriptively and analysed using an MMRM similar to the one specified in Section 7.2.2, except that baseline body weight will be replaced in the model by [CONTACT_517393]. The model will be used to obtain covariate-adjusted mean estimates of differences between active BI 456906 doses and placebo at the relevant time point. 
MCPMod dose finding analyses will not be performed for any secondary endpoints.

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period (REP), a period of [ADDRESS_670622] dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
Safety analyses will be performed on the Treated Set (TS), using the actual maintenance 
treatment received. Key safety analyses will also be performed using the randomised maintenance treatment (if this is different for any patient). 
In general, safety analyses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No 
hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_195912] (MedDRA) at database lock.

7.5: 1 below. 
A success was defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria:
1. Null hypothesis of flat dose response was rejected in favour of at least one of the 
alternative candidate models, and  
2. A target dose was selected within the dose range using the following criterion: 
difference in mean between selected dose and placebo < -9.0%, and
3. Proportion of patients in the highest dose group meeting the responder definition 
(percentage change in body weight from baseline < -10.0%) was greater than 35%.

designees, or by [CONTACT_1744] / IEC or by [CONTACT_12721]. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
CRFs for individual patients will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. See section [IP_ADDRESS] for rules 
about emergency code breaks. For drug accountability, refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make at least one documented attempt to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_517370]. Before sending or uploading those copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers (e.g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social security number) have properly been removed or redacted from any copy of the patients’ source documents. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the participant’s medical file.
For eDiary, the electronic record is the source document.

documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.[ADDRESS_670634] access to source data and documents
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source documents/data, including progress notes, copi[INVESTIGATOR_15587], which must be available at all times for review by [CONTACT_2689], auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA).

8.7 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL
The trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_23347] (BI).
A Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_88800]. Tasks and responsibilities are defined in a contract. 
An independent external committee (Clinical Event Committee, [CEC]) will be established to 
adjudicate some events, as specified in section 5 , jointly with trial 1404-0043 (BI 456906 
dose finding trial in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)).
Events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_517395]; both in a 
blinded fashion. Events to be reviewed will be defined in a charter.
Events may either be defined by [CONTACT_23281]/or relevant adverse events or 
both.
For qualifying events, relevant source documents generated from any medical evaluations of 
these events will be requested including for example laboratory values, histological analysis, reports from ultrasound, CT, MRI, scintigraphy, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15588], and medical reports from other physicians. All evaluations will be performed in a blinded fashion. 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established, jointly with trial 1404.43.
Members of the DMC are independent of BI, they are physicians experienced in the treatment of the disease under investigation and a statistician. The DMC will evaluate safety data. The DMC will receive urgent significant safety concerns, and cases of DILI, for immediate evaluation. While DMC members may be unblinded, measures are in place to ensure the blinding for everyone else involved in the trial. Regular DMC meetings will be held at specified intervals. The DMC will recommend continuation, modification or termination of the trial as detailed in the DMC charter. DMC recommendations as well as the final BI decision will be reported to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities (RAs)/Health Authorities (HAs), IRBs/ECs, and to investigators as requested by [CONTACT_1769]. The tasks and responsibilities of the DMC are specified in a charter.
Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators (e.g. their curricula 
vitae) will be filed in the ISF.

10.2 BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE
Initially, blood pressure should be taken in both arms. If the pressures differ by [CONTACT_726] 10 
mmHg (as in the presence of a subclavian steal syndrome), obtain readings in both arms. The arm with the highest pressure (either systolic or diastolic) should be used for all subsequent measurements.  Blood pressure measurements should be performed on the same arm and, if possible, by [CONTACT_517398]. The same method and device must be used throughout the trial for a patient.After patients have rested quietly, in the seated position for five minutes, three blood pressuremeasurements will be taken two minutes apart and all three results will have to be entered inthe CRF. The seated pulse rate will be taken during the two-minute interval between thesecond and third blood pressure reading.
Blood pressure measurements should be recorded to the nearest 2 mmHg when applicable

Statistical analysis and sample size calculation: ................................................ 7-[ADDRESS_202204] and QOL Study Protocol Version 1 12.31.18  3 1. Description of the study:   The purpose of this study is to determine whether bacterial decolonization of the nares and skin prior to treatment with radiotherapy (RT) for patients with cancers of the head and neck or breast, can prevent high-grade radiation dermatitis (RD) and improve quality of life. This study is being conducted because prior studies from this research group have found bacterial colonization in the nose prior to initiation of RT to be associated with an increased risk of high grade RD. Patients in the treatment arm will receive pretreatment with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_172728], while patients in the control arm will receive standard of care treatment. Bacterial cultures will be taken from the nares, radiated skin, and site contralateral to radiation at baseline and at completion of RT from all participants. If severe infection requiring systemic antibiotics occurs, we may obtain additional cultures. Participants will also participate in a quality of life questionnaire before and after RT.  2. Background:  RD is a common and often debilitating adverse event associated with the use of fractionated external beam RT for the treatment of numerous cancers. RD may occur within hours to weeks of exposure to radiation and often worsens throughout the course of treatment.[ADDRESS_202205] occurs in up to 95% of patients who receive RT for curative cancer treatment and rates are highest amongst patients treated for breast, head and neck, and anogenital cancers.[ADDRESS_202206], the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (the CTCAE), grades RD on a scale of 0-5, with higher grades indicating more severe involvement as seen in figure 1.[ADDRESS_202207] shown that secondary infection with bacteria such as Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) has been implicated in RD, and they propose that bacteria exacerbates dermatitis via activation of MHC class II molecules on immune cells.[ADDRESS_202208] was also confirmed in a small study which found that 23% of RD patients had secondary skin infections and that a large subset of those patients (57%) developed grade [ADDRESS_202209] of care in the intensive care unit and prior to orthopedic surgery in order to prevent infectious complications. For example, Huang et al found that universal SA decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_172729] (MRSA) prevalence and MRSA-associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54992] a county-wide study.[ADDRESS_202210] and head/neck cancer, as these cancer types are associated with the highest incidence of RD. Anogenital cancers will not be included in this study, as too few patients from this category were recruited in our preliminary study to achieve statistical significance. Furthermore, this study excludes patients receiving RT for palliative intent as these patients receive few treatments and are unlikely to develop radiation dermatitis. By [CONTACT_67940] a similar decolonization protocol in patients receiving RT, we hope to prevent the development of RD and improve quality of life.  3. Objectives and endpoints: 1. The primary goal is to determine if bacterial decolonization prior to RT prevents development of high grade RD (grade 2-5). The primary endpoint is the incidence of high grade RD at the end of the trial. 2. The secondary goal is to assess if the intervention improves quality of life compared to the control arm. The secondary endpoint is the quality of life, assessed by [CONTACT_172737]-16. 4. Study Design:  4.[ADDRESS_202211] inclusion criteria: 1. Age ≥ [ADDRESS_202212] or head and neck with plans for fractionated RT (≥ 15 fractions) with curative intent, including post-operative patients deemed eligible for RT by [CONTACT_172738]  4.2 Patient exclusion criteria: 1. Prior RT to the region of interest 2. Existing dermatologic condition affecting the treatment area (eg: atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and non-healing wounds)  3. Known allergy to chlorhexidine or mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]  4.3 Recruitment:  Patients will be recruited from the Montefiore-Einstein Department of Radiation Oncology.  Study physicians will identify patients seen in their clinics that meet the study’s inclusion criteria.  We aim to recruit up to [ADDRESS_202213]. Therefore, all participants, regardless of baseline culture results, will be 1:1 randomized to one of two arms: the intervention arm and the control arm. The randomization will be performed in a stratified manner within each of the two cancer types (breast cancer or head and neck cancer).   All patients, regardless of treatment arm, will receive a complete history and physical exam during their screening visit. Patients in the control arm will be treated according to standard of care without any RD prophylaxis. Patients in the intervention arm will receive a decolonization regimen, which is accepted as standard of care and commonly used in other patient populations (ICU and prior to orthopedic surgery). The decolonization regimen will consist of intranasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_172730]. This combined regimen will be conducted by [CONTACT_172739] [ADDRESS_202214]’s note in the electronic health record will be used in place of clinical photographs. Research funds from the division of dermatology and radiation oncology will be used to pay for bacterial culture swabs, wound culture laboratory fees, mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], and chlorhexidine solutions.

Finally, de-identified samples from superficial skin swabs will be placed in a storage buffer meant to preserve bacterial nucleotides and kept in a freezer at -80C for 
Bacterial Decolonization RCT and QOL Study Protocol Version 1 12.31.18  6 future microbiome analysis. Bacterial RNA and DNA will then be extracted from the samples in order to perform skin microbiome analysis via whole-community metagenomics sequencing and RNA transcriptomics sequencing.  Of note, only bacterial samples from culture swabs will be stored for future microbiome analysis of the skin flora. No DNA from participants will be stored.   Study evaluations will include:  Before RT and within two weeks of completion of RT:  • Bacterial cultures obtained via a superficial swab from (1) the nares, (2) skin at the irradiated site and (3) contralateral or other non-radiated skin. This is a non-invasive test using a cotton-tipped applicator inserted into the nostrils or rubbed on the skin. • Superficial swabs from the same 3 sites will be obtained in the same manner to be stored in a -80° C freezer for future de-identified microbiome analyses. • Standardized photographs of skin at radiated site to be graded by a dermatologist blinded to study arm. Additional photographs or notes from the chart may be taken in the case of that severe RD develops during treatment. • Quality of Life assessment using the Skindex-16 questionnaire.10  Before and during RT: • Patients will be asked to initial each date on the supplied calendar when they complete the decolonization protocol in order to assess compliance.   4.5 Study Calendar and Study Timeline  Study Calendar:  Screening  Pre-RT     (-5 days) Radiation Therapy Week 2  Radiation Therapy  Week 4 Radiation Therapy  Week 6 (if applicable) Radiation Therapy  Week 8 (if applicable) Last day of RT or within 2 weeks of RT completion Informed Consent X       Complete History and Physical X      X Randomization X       Bacterial Culture Swabs* X      X Photographs of skin at radiated site X      X Skindex-16 Questionnaire X      X Decolonization Regimen  XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX  Patient Medication Calendar** X X X X X X

Study Timeline:  April 2019- April [ADDRESS_202217] randomization and the study coordinator will hold the randomization key. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the interventional arm and the control arm using 2-sample t-tests for continuous variables and using Pearson’s chi square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Primary endpoint analysis: The primary study endpoint is development of higher grade radiation dermatitis (RD) (grade 2-5) compared to lower grade RD (grade 0-1) during the course of external beam radiotherapy. While grades 3-5 are normally considered "high-grade radiation dermatitis,” we will be considering and analyzing grades 2-5 as “higher grade radiation dermatitis” versus grades 0-1 as “lower grade dermatitis.” No patients in our previous study experienced grades 4-5 radiation dermatitis, so this groupi[INVESTIGATOR_172732].		Pearson’s chi square or Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare the incidence rates of high-grade (grade 2-5) radiation dermatitis between the interventional arm and the control arm to assess whether the intervention is 
Bacterial Decolonization RCT and QOL Study Protocol Version [ADDRESS_202218]. Logistic regression models will be used to assess this association while adjusting for covariates including age, gender, BMI, cancer type, radiation dose, and concurrent chemotherapy.  Secondary endpoint analysis: Secondary endpoint, quality of life (QoL), will be assessed before and after the radiotherapy. Paired t-tests will be used to compare the QoL summary score between baseline and at the end of the trial within each arm. The 2-sample t-test will be used to compare the QoL score change from baseline to the end of radiotherapy between the two arms. Linear regression models will be used to compare the changes in QoL scores between the 2 arms while adjusting for covariates including age, gender, BMI, cancer type, radiation dose, and concurrent chemotherapy. Missing data will be minimized by [CONTACT_094]-emptively implementing effective participant follow-up strategies and by [CONTACT_172740]. In the subsequent analyses, we will evaluate the type and mechanisms of missing data, for example whether it is missing at random (MAR). Multiple imputations may be used to impute missing data. Results obtained from data with imputation will be compared to those obtained from complete data to assess the influence of missing data. Reasons and characteristics of loss-to-follow-up will be documented and examined in order to assess the extent to which patient attrition could bias our results.  Power Analysis: Based on previous studies, we expect that ~50% of our recruited patients will have breast cancer and ~50% will have head/neck cancer. To control for this, we plan to randomize patients in a stratified manner, so that 30 patients with each subtype of cancer will be recruited into each arm (interventional and control arm).	With 30 patients in the interventional arm and 30 patients in the control arm, assuming a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, the study has 0.[ADDRESS_202219]. The sample size was calculated based on results from a previous study from our lab, in which the incidence rate of grade 2-3 radiation dermatitis in the control arm was 0.38. Assuming a conservative 25% attrition rate in the study, we plan to recruit a total of 80 patients (40 each arm) in order to ensure a final sample size of 60 (30 each arm).   6. Data Monitoring and Safety    6.[ADDRESS_202220] access to the data. Patient identifying information will be recorded to allow for appropriate medical chart review, which will be important for the study’s analyses. The clinic’s data managers will help oversee that all patient data and information is protected and confidential. All patients will receive an identification code that will be kept in a password protected excel spreadsheet associated with their MRN. All other patient study information will be kept separate from any of their identifying information.   
Bacterial Decolonization RCT and QOL Study Protocol Version [ADDRESS_202221] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: • What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study • Who will have access to that information and why • Who will use or disclose that information • The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. • In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  6.3 Source Documents  Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  6.4 Adverse Event Monitoring and Reporting  As this is an interventional protocol, any adverse events will be recorded and reported. Both mupi[INVESTIGATOR_172733], therefore few adverse events are expected. Because this is small single site study with no more than minimal risk expected, the study principle investigator (PI) will monitor closely for adverse events. The treating radiation oncologist will assess for adverse events at each radiotherapy visit as well. Any unanticipated or serious events (grade 3 or higher) related to participation in this study will be investigated by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_172734].  All adverse events will be recorded in an electronic document that is de-identified. This adverse events log, attached in the appendix, will then be submitted to the IRB at the time of protocol renewal.  Unanticipated problems, defined by [CONTACT_19819] (OHRP) include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
Bacterial Decolonization RCT and QOL Study Protocol Version 1 12.31.18  10 2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  Any incident that meets all three criteria will be reported study and clinic staff to the Principle Investigator within 48 hours.  All serious events related to study participation and death among participants will be reported to the Einstein IRB via:  Phone: [PHONE_3735] Email: [EMAIL_3433]     Events that require reporting will be graded according to the CTCAE version 5.0.  All study related clinic sites have access to this form and it can be downloaded at http://ctep.cancer.gov.  Already in place in and distinct from the study, all safety monitor and reporting will be done by [CONTACT_172741]. There will be no Data Monitoring Committee.  Any serious events will be reported to both the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397].  The study PI, co-investigators and key personnel will be charged with assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance, interim monitoring of accumulated data from research activities to assure the continuing safety of participants, relevance of the study question, appropriateness of the study, and integrity of the accumulating data.              7.

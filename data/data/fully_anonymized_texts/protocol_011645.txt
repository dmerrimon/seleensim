dose adjustment of afatinib is an effective measure to reduce 
treatment -related AEs without affecting therapeutic efficacy .
The objective of this non- interventional study (NIS):
Real-World Data will help to understand if dose modifications are 
done similar as in LUX -Lung 3 trial and if the outcome on safety and 
effectiveness are as in trial settings. Furthermore, data on modified 
starting dose s, the underlying reasons and effects on safety and 
outcome will be collected .
Research question 
and objectives:Primary objective:
To assess the effects of Gi(l)otrif®dose modification on the frequency 
and severity of adverse drug reactio ns, time on treatment and time to 
progression with Gi(l)otrif®in real -world set ting and compare with 
data from LUX -Lung 3 trial in a descriptive manner.
Secondary objective:
To obtain information on frequency and reasons for a modified starting 
dose of Gi(l )otrif®in real -world setting.
Study design: Non-interventional, multi -country, multi -sitestudy based on existing 
data from medical records of patients treated with Gi(l)otrif®as part of

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_948772] marketing approval of afatinib was granted on 12 Jul 2013 in the [LOCATION_003] (trade name 
[CONTACT_698792]®) for the indication of first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCL C) whose tumors have epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) exon 19 
deletions or exon 21 (L 858R) substitution mutations as detected b y an FDA -approved test.
It was approved in the European Union on 25 Sep 2013 (trade name [CONTACT_698793]®) as monotherap y
indicated for the treatment of EGFR TKI-naï ve adult patients with locally  advanced or
metastatic NSCL C with activating EGFR mutation(s).
The approval of G iotrif®was based on the results observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076] L UX-Lung 3
study . The LUX -Lung 3 study  investigated the efficacy  of chemotherapy  compared with 
afatinib, a selective, orally  bioavailable ErbB family  blocker that irreversibly  blocks signaling 
from epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR/ErbB1), human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2 (HE R2/ErbB2), and ErbB4 and has wide -spectrum preclinical activity  against 
EGFR mutations. A total of 1,269 patients were screened, and 345 were randomly  assigned to 
treatment (afatinib or chemotherap y).Median progression- free survival (PFS)was 11.1 
months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI , 0.43 
to 0.78; P .001). Median PFS among those with exon 19 deletions and L858R EGFR 
mutations (n 308) was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherap y (HR, 0.47; 
95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P .001). The most common treatment related adverse events were 
diarrhea, rash/acne, and stomatitis for afatinib and nausea, fatigue, and decreased appetite for 
chemotherap y. Patients reported outcomes ( PROs ) favored afatinib, with better control of 
cough, d yspnea, and pain (P13-[ZIP_CODE] ).
Afatinib 40 mg/day  (oral) is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced EGFRm+ 
NSCL C. Dose adjustments are recommended based on pre -defined tolerability  criteria .A 
post- hoc anal yses of the effects of afatinib dose reduction on adverse events (AEs), 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and PFS in the phase III LUX -Lung 3 trial showed that dose 
reductions occurred in 53% (122/229) of patients; the majority  (86%) within the first 6 
month s of treatment. In patients who dose reduced, decreases in the incidences of drug -
related all grade (grade ≥3) AEs were 99.2% (20.5%) to 46.7% (4.1%) for diarrhea, 88.5% 
(26.2%) to 38.5% (3.3%) for rash/acne, 77.0% (12.3%) to 27.9% (0%) for stomatitis, and 
44.3% (16.4%) to 36.9% (4.9%) for nail effects. Dose reductions tended to be more common 
in female patients, older patients, patients of Eastern Asian ethnicit y, and patients with lower 
body  weight. Dose reduction was more likely  in patients with higher plasma concentrations 
of afatinib. On Day  43, patients who dose reduced to 30 mg ≥ 4 day s previously  (n=38) had 
geometric mean plasma afatinib concentrations of 24.4 ng/mL, vs 23.7 ng/mL  in patients who 
remained on the 40 mg dose (n=126). Median PFS was [ADDRESS_948773] 6 months of treatment, vs 11.0 months in patients who did not 
(HR=1.25 [95% CI , 0.91–1.72]). [ASCO 2015, Yang et al, # 8073] (P15-[ZIP_CODE] ).
Post-hoc anal yses from LUX- Lung [ADDRESS_948774] that tolerability -guided dose adjustment of 
afatinib is an effective measure to reduce treatment -related AEs without affecting therapeutic

9.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a non- interventional, multi -country , multi- sitestudy  based on existing data from 
medical records of patients treated with Gi(l)otrif®as part of the routine treatment according 
to the approved label.
Key study  outcomes are:
Effec ts of Gi(l)otrif®dose reduction on frequency of ADRs, and time on treatment, 
time to progression
Proportion of patients starting with modifie d 
Gi(l)otrif®dose andthe underly ing 
reason(s) 
Data on diagnosis, gender, date of birth, ethnicit y, body weight and height , Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology  Group performance score (ECOG) ( R14-
0080 ), EGFR mutational 
subgroup (Del19/L858R), starting dose of Gi(l)otrif®, start date of Gi(l)otrif®  treatment ,dose 
modifications with date, 
ADR s, concomitant medication s(limited to medication for 
management of diarrhea, skin effects, mucositis/stomatitis as dichotomous variables (e.g. 
received anti -diarrhea medication y es/no), reason for dose modification of Gi(l)otrif®, 
treatment duration of Gi(l)otrif®, time to progression and ty pe of progression (clinical, 
radiographic or both clinical/radiographic progression) will be collected from patients 
medical records b y investigator s.
9.2 SETTING
The NIS will be conducted in about 25-30 sites gl obally which are experienced in lung cancer 
treatment. An average of 8-10 patien
ts per site (with a maximum of up to 15 patients per site)
is expected. 
Patient participation in this NI S is voluntary . Patients were treated and are treated according 
to the standard of care independent of patient’s consent to participate in this NI S.
9.2.1 Selection of s tudy population
Site selection:
Sites in countries with launch dates prior to 1stJan 2015 and known to prescribe Gi(l)otrif®
on a regular basis will be chosen. Asian and Non- Asian countries will be included.
Inclusion criteria:
All consecutive patients willbe included if all the following criteria are present:
Age ≥18 years

Patients with EGFR mutation (common mutations), TKI -naïve advanced NSCL C, 
treated wit h Gi(l)otrif®as the first-line treatment for NSCL C within the approved 
label
Signed and dated written informed consent per regulations. ( Exemption of a written 
informed consent for retrospective observational studies in some countries per local 
regulations and legal requirements
.)
Exclusion criteria:
Patient won't be included if any  of the following criteria is present:
Any contraindication t o Gi(l)otrif®as specified in label.
Patients with uncommon mutations are excluded as uncommon mutations are not 
within label in all participat ing countries (e .g.[LOCATION_003]).
Patients still on treatment with Gi(l)otrif®will be excluded unless treatment period is 
≥6 months.
Patients treated with Gi(l)otrif®within an interventional trial.
A log of all patients included into the study will be maintained in the I SF at the
investigational site.
Patients treated with Gi(l)otrif®in interventional trials are excluded to ensure the non
-
intervention al setting of this study . The threshold of ≥ 6 months treatment with Gi(l)otrif®for 
patients being still on treatment was chosen to avoid earl y censoring and enable collection of 
mature data on A DRs and treatment duration. However, patients who stopped Gi(l)otrif®< 6 
months will be included to avoid bias. All patients fulfilling inc lusion and exclusion criteria 
from a site will be entered to avoid bias. The maximum of 15 patients per site was chosen to 
avoid bias by [CONTACT_698782] .
BI reserves the right to discontinue the study  overall or at a parti cular study site at any  time 
for the following reasons:
1. F ailure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular study  site.
2.Violat ion of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (as applicable), the Study  Protocol, or the 
contract b y a stud y site or invest igator , disturbing the appropriate conduct of the 
study .

9.4 DATA SOURCES
NIS based on existing data from patients’ medical records. Data will be collected in the 
eCRF. SDV will be performed on about 30% of included patients .
9.[ADDRESS_948777] -hoc analy sis of LUX -Lung 3 providing the rationale for this study was based on 229 
patients with 53% patients experiencing dose reduction. With a sample size of [ADDRESS_948778] data. It will be 
sufficient to anal yse the effects of dose modification on patients ’safet y and eff ectiveness and
tocompare it with data from L UX-Lung [ADDRESS_948779] 25- 30% patients starting with a lower dose.
There will be around 50 patients starting with a modified dose, and around half of them with 
further de -/-escalation. This is a sufficient sample size to get some impression on the reasons 
of a modified starting dose in real -world setting .

9.6 DATA MAN AGEMENT
Patients’ data will be gathered inRemote Data Capture (RDC) s ystem.
The data management procedures to ensure the quality  of the data will be described in detail 
inthe Statistical and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_698777] (SEAP) available in TMF .
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
9.7.1 Main analysis
All collected data will be anal ysed separatel y for patients starting with 40mg and ≤ 30mg. 
Although due to anticipated low sample size in patients starting with ≤ 30mg, it will be 
mainly  for exploratory  purpose. Baseline demographics will be anal ysed with descriptive 
statistics (N, median, mean, 25%, 75% percentile, SD) and compared descriptively  between 
patients who have dose modification swithin the first 6 months of Gi(l)otrif®treatment and 
those who do not. All the demographics , safety and efficacy data from this study in real -
world setting will be compared with data from LUX -Lung 3 trial in descriptive manner.
Analysis of Safety :
Safety  anal ysis will include all patients treated wi th Gi(l)otrif®and be descriptive in nature. 
Incidence and severit y of ADR saccordi ng to Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE )criteria (version 4.0) (R15-5988 )when available will be summarized and 
display ed in number/percentage. For patients who had Gi(l)otrif®dose modifications within 
the first 6 months of Gi(l)otrif®treatment , frequency  and severity  of the common ADR s pre-
and post -dose modification will be a nalysed (≥ 40mg vs < 40mg; and ≥ 30mg vs < 3
0mg).
Missing or incomplete A DRdates will be imputed according to BI internal SOPs .
Analysis of Effectiveness:
Effectiveness analysis will include all patients treated with Gi(l)otrif®. Time on treatment is 
from the date of first dose of Gi(l)otrif®treatment to the date of last dose of Gi(l)otrif®
treatment. Time to progression is from the date of first dose of Gi(l)otrif®treatment to the 
earliest date of documented progression (clinical, radiographic or both clinical/radiographic 
progression) or death
. Time on treatment and time to progression will be estimated using 
Kaplan -Meier method, and the median along with two -sided 95% CI will be display ed(use 
the Greenwood’s formula for estimation of standard errors). Log- rank test will be applied to 
compare between patients with and without dose modifications. Time on treatment and time 
to progression will be compared between patients who dose reduced to < [ADDRESS_948780] 6 months of Gi(l)otrif®treatment and those who remained on Gi(l)otrif®40mg once 
daily . This is in analogy  to the anal ysis made on LUX -Lung [ADDRESS_948781] survival analy sis techniques. For patients still on treatment, time on treatment 
will be censored at the date of data collection. For patients still on treatment and without 
progression, time to progression will be censored at the date of data collec tion. For patients 
stopped treatment and without progression/death or progression/death date missing, time to

implausi ble entries to the data entry  clerk/doctor.
If corrections are necessary after the data are saved, these will be documented in an audit 
trail.
For the further quality  assurance of the documented patient observations, a sample- size based 
source data verific ation will be performed on about 30% of included patients. An additional 
inspection/quality  assurance check of this NIS can be performed in case of any  deviation.
9.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METH ODS
The generalization and consequently  the external validit y of the stud y results, may be limited 
by [CONTACT_698785] y sites that prescribe Gi(l)otrif®on a regular basis to 
ensure sufficient patient recruitment. Patients treated by  [CONTACT_1697] s with less experience 
might experience more side effects during their treatment with Gi(l)otrif®.
Methodological efforts have been taken to minimize selection bias: these efforts include the 
recommendation to include consecutive patients meeting each of t
he inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria. In addition, this possible selection bias may  be limited by  [CONTACT_698786] , data that have been alread y collected at the time of 
the study . Linked to this aspect is then the limitation due to data availability . Indeed, no 
additional data will be collected for the stud y purpose. So if the data is not available in the 
patient files, then this will be considered as missing data.
In addition, to reduce error in data colle ction, a standard study eCRF will be used, ensuring a 
measure of consistency  among the collectors.
Another limitation is coming from the diverse handling of data collection from deceased 
patients which is allowed without informed consent in some countries 
but not in all. 
However, no country -based anal yses will be done. G iven the median overall survival (31.6 
months in LUX -Lung 3) and that time from launch of Gi(l)otrif to data collection in the 
participating countries i
s shorter than the median overall survival ( OS)the majority  of the 
patients are expected to be alive .

10. PRO TECTION OF HUMAN SUB JECTS
10.1 INFORMED CONSENT, DA TA PROTECTION, STUDY RECORDS
The study  will be carried out in compliance with the protocol, the principles laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation
(ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP (to the extent applicable to the NI S setting
and required b y local regulations), Good Epi[INVESTIGATOR_148722] (GEP), Guidelines for
Good Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_80642] (GPP), and relevant BI SOPs. Standard medical care
(proph ylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) remains in the responsibility  of the
treating investigator of the patient.
The investigator should inform the sponsor immediately  of any  urgent safety  measures taken 
to protect t he study  subjects against any  immediate hazard, and also of an y serious breaches 
of the protocol, ICH GCP and Japanese GCP regulations (Ministry of Health and Welfare 
Ordinance No. 28, March 27, 1997).
The rights of the investigator and of the sponsor wit h regard to publication of the results of 
this trial are described in the investigator contract. As a general rule, no trial results should be 
published prior to finalisation of the Study  Report.
10.1.1 Study approval, patient information, and informed consent
This study  will be initiated only  after all required legal documentation has been reviewed and 
approved b y the respective I RB / IEC and competent authority  (CA) according to national 
and international regulations. The same applies for the implement ation of changes introduced 
by [CONTACT_15635].
In some countries, retrospective observational studies can be exempt from a written informed 
consent per local regulations and legal requirements, I RB / IEC often grants a waiver of 
consent for retrospective char t review studies. In order to avoid bias b y exclusion of subjects 
that cannot be given informed consent for any reason like death, missing contact [CONTACT_698789]., exempt from a written informed consent should be asked for such situations.
In case such a waiver is not given, prior to patient participation in the study , written informed 
consent must be obtained from each patient (or the patient’s legall y accepted representative) 
according to ICH GCP and to the regulatory  and legal requirements of the parti cipating 
country .
Each signature [CONTACT_577123] y dated b y each signatory  and the informed consent and an y 
additional patient- information form retained b y the investigator as part of the trial records. A 
signed cop y of the informed consent and an y additional patient information must be given to 
each patient or the patient’s legally accepted representative.

11. MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS/ ADVERSE DRUG REACTIO NS
11.1 DEFINITIONS OF ADVER SE EVENTS
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and
unintended sig n (e.g. an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the
medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise 
from use of the p roduct within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -
label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any  AE which
-     results in death,
-     is life -threatening,
-
    requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or
-
    prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],
-     results in persistent or significant disability  or incapac ity, or
-
    is a congenital anomaly /birth defect
Life-
threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at
the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hy pothetically  might have caused
death if more severe.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_698779].
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_687355]. Any  suspected transmission via a medicinal product of
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
For Japan, a n AE which possibly  leads to disability  will be reported as an SAE
.
Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)
Boehringer Ingelheim Page 27of 38
Protocol for non -interventional studies based on existing data
BI Study Number 1200.270 c09038525-01
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_948789] be collected b y the investigator in the eCRF from signing the informed
consent onwards until the end o f the stud y:
all ADRs (serious and non- serious)
all AEs with fatal outcome
for Japan:  an AE which possibly leads to disability  will be reported as an SAE
All ADRs, including those persisting after stud y completion must be followed up until they
are reso
lved, have been sufficientl y characterized, or no further information can be obtained.
The investigator carefully assesses whether an AE constitutes an ADR using the information
below.
Causal relationship of AEs
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event (AE). An adverse 
reaction, in contrast to an AE, is characterized by  [CONTACT_49392] a causal relationship between a
medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected.
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge,
confounding factors such as concomitant med ication, concomitant diseases and relevant
history .
Arguments that may  suggest a reasonable causal relationship could be:
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class .
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re
-introduced

BI Study Number 1200.270 c09038525-01
Proprietary confidential information © 2016 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
No medically sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. 
preexisting or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response ( i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days/weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_698780], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
Additional ar guments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the study  drug treatment continues or 
remains unchanged.
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the CTCAE 
criteria (version 4.0 ) (R15-5988 ) in the eCRF.
Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a study . Once a subject has been enrolled into the 
study , after having taken Gi(l)otrif®the investigator must report any  drug exposure during
pregnancy ,which occurred in a female subject or in a partner t o a male subject to the Sponsor 
by [CONTACT_15627] A of the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form. The outcome of the pregnancy  
associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be followed up and reported b y 
means of Part B of the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form.
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and Part B).
In the absence of a reportable AE, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form must be completed,
otherwise the NI S AE form is to be completed and forwarded as well within the r espective
timelines.
Expedited Reporting of AEs and Drug Exposure During Pregnancy
The following must be reported by [CONTACT_698790]:

Gi(l)otrif®[ADDRESS_948790] the requirement to complete and fax the NI S AE form.
Information required
For each reportable AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the
appropriate eCRF pages and the NIS AE form .
Reporting of related AEs associated with any other BI drug
The investigator is encouraged to report all AEs related to any  BI drug other than Gi(l)otrif®
according to the local regulatory  requir ements for spontaneous AE reporting at the
investigator’s discretion by  [CONTACT_660354]. The
term AE includes drug exposure during pregnancy , and, regardless of whether an AE
occurred or not, an y abuse, off- label use, misuse, medication error, occupational exposure,
lack of effect, and unexpected benefit.
11.3 REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES
Adverse event reporting to regulatory  agencies will be done by  [CONTACT_698791]. 
Expedited reporting of serious adverse events (SAE), e.g. suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to health authorities and IECs/I RBs, will be done according to 
local regulatory  requirements. Further details regarding this reporting procedure are provided 
in the I SF.

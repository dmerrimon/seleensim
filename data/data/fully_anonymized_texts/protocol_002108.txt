ObjectivesPrimary
• To determine the transplant related mortality (TRM) of this novel
reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIT)
conditioning regimen in a patient population usually not eligible or
unable to tolerate a full myeloablative allogeneic transplant.
Secondary
• To evaluate clinical response, progression free survival (PFS) at
one year, engraftment rate, and graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD)
incidence with this novel RIT regimen that utilizes a higher dose of
melphalan than the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_225196] a variety of
hematological conditions.
• Correlative studies will include chimerism analysis by [CONTACT_225238].
Study DesignThis trial is designed as an open label, non-randomized, single
institution study. The primary objective of this study is estimation
of the true population TRM rate by [CONTACT_4475] 100 for patients with co¬
morbidities undergoing RIT who would not be otherwise eligible
for or unable to tolerate a full myeloablative transplant. This study
will build on our previous experience on Clinical Trial 118807

which utilized a lower dose of melphalan.
Eligible patients will receive conditioning regimen and allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplant as the following:
Fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on days -5 to -2
Melphalan 75 mg/m2 on day -2
Total body irradiation (TBI) 400 cGy (two fractions of 200 cGy
each) on day -[ADDRESS_270833] stage of accrual (41
evaluable patients), data will be reviewed to decide if the study
should be terminated due to unacceptable toxicity.
Evaluable patients are defined as patients who do not have
disease progression within day 100. Non-evaluable patients
will be excluded for the primary objective—day 100 TRM
evaluation. Non-evaluable patients will be included in the
secondary objective analysis including clinical response, PFS at
one year, engraftment rate, and GvHD incidence.
Accrual Target / Duration Accrual target is [ADDRESS_270834] 12 months after
recruitment completion, so total study duration will be 5 years.
Evaluation CriteriaSafetv Assessments: The primary end point of this study is 1KM at
day 100. Safety will be evaluated on an ongoing basis with weekly
outcome assessment and grading for the first [ADDRESS_270835]
transplant. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe safety and
other outcomes. Toxicity will be scored according to the Bearman
Criteria in Appendix I, oral mucositis by [CONTACT_225239], acute GvHD according to the criteria in Appendix III
and chronic GvHD by [CONTACT_225240].
Survival: PFS at one vear

mi 11 iprams/meter^. the nrimarv obiective is to evaluate dav 100
TRM to ensure this remmen remains safe without excessive
toxicity. The samnle size is determined based on the orimarv
obiective: assess the day 100 TRM rate of the study treatment as
compared to historical controls. The day 100 TRM for the historical
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FluCy) is 10% but it has a high day
100 rate of disease progression at 20%. The day 100 TRM for
fludarabine/melphalan 140 mg/m2 (FluMel) is 16% and the day 100
disease progression is 9%. The day 100 TRM from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_225198] 50 mg/m2 melphalan (protocol No. 1-118807)
is 11% with a day 100 disease progression rate of 11%. This
protocol increases the melphalan dose from 50 mg/m to 75 mg/m
with the goal of providing better disease control. We will study
whether or not this results a TRM rate betweenl 0% and 20%. The
sample size calculation is based on testing the hypotheses
concerning the proportion of the population who experience a TRM
at 100 days:
H0:p> 20%,
H0:p< 20%.
This two-stage design requires a potential total of 81 patients in
order to achieve approximately 80% power to detect differences of
10 percentage points (20% versus 10%).
Survival: The estimated distributions of overall and progression
free survival will be obtained using the product-limit based Kaplan-
Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier methodology will allow for
incorporation of the censored observations thereby [CONTACT_225243] a
more efficient estimate of the true distribution than if this
information was not used. Estimates of quantities such as median
duration will be obtained.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Title: A PHASE II TRIAL OF REDUCED INTENSITY ALLOGENEIC STEM
CELL TRANSPLANTATION WITH FLUDARABINE, MELPHALAN AND
LOW DOSE TOTAL BODY IRRADIATION
Precis:
Reduced intensity conditioning during allogeneic hematopi[INVESTIGATOR_225199]
(HSCT) reduces transplant related mortality (TRM) by [CONTACT_225245]-versus-
malignancy effect rather than the conditioning regimen to eradicate disease. Reduced
intensity conditioning regimens can provide a curative option for patients with
hematologic malignancies who might otherwise not be candidates for myeloablative
(intensive) transplantation because of age or poor performance status. Since the ability to
perform transplant safely is the primary measure of efficacy for reduced intensity
conditioning, TRM is the appropriate measure of efficacy of the conditioning regimen.
Reduced intensity transplantation (RIT) is also the standard of care for certain bone
marrow failure states. However, at minimal levels of conditioning intensity such as with
the fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FluCy) or the Fludarabine/200 cGy Total Body
Irradiation (Flu/200cGyTBI) regimens, high rates of relapse have been noted,
particularly in the myeloid malignancies (AML/MDS). Further improvement in reduced
intensity transplantation technique could therefore be achieved by [CONTACT_225246]
(by [CONTACT_225247]) or to hasten the development of GvL
(by [CONTACT_225248]). In our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_225200] (RIT), we explored a lower dose
melphalan of 50 mg/m2 in combination with fludarabine (40 mg/m /day x 4 days) and a
lower dose TBI (400 cGy) (FluMelTBI) (Protocol No. 1-118807). While the regimen
was safe (Day 100 TRM^l 1%), the disease progression rate at day 100 was at 11%. In
this trial, we propose to increase the melphalan dose to 75 mg/m2 in combination
with fludarabine (40 mg/m2/day x 4 days) and low dose TBI with the intention to
improve cytoreduction and hence improve the disease control rate, while preserving
the low rate of TRM. Therefore, TRM will remain the primary objective and day 100
response rate, PFS at one year, engraftment rate, and GvHD incidence are the secondary
objectives.
Objectives:
Primary: To determine the TRM of this RIT combination in a patient population who
would be at risk for excessive TRM during a full myeloablative allogeneic transplant.
Secondary: To evaluate clinical response, PFS at one year, engraftment rate, and GvHD
incidence with our RIT regimen across a variety of hematological conditions. Correlative

studies will include chimerism analysis by [CONTACT_225249].
Rationale For Regimen Dose Selection:
Fludarabine, a purine nucleoside analog is a potent immunosuppressant that will help
prevent donor cell rejection by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_841]. Doses range from 120-200 mg/m over 4 or
5 days and this protocol will utilize 40 mg/m2/ per day x 4 days.
Melphalan is an alkylating agent and doses above 140 mg/m2 are considered
myeloablative. In our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_225201], we evaluated a lower dose of 50 mg/m2 in combination with fludarabine
(40 mg/m2/day x 4 days) and lower dose TBI (400 cGy) (Protocol No. 1-118807). While
the regimen was safe (The day 100 TRM is 11%), the day 100 disease progression rate is
11%. In this trial, we propose to increase the melphalan dose to 75 mg/m x 1 dose in
combination with fludarabine (40 mg/m2/day x 4 days) and lower dose TBI (400 cGy) (2
doses over 1 day) with the intention to improve cytoreduction and improve disease
control while preserving the low rate of TRM.
Total Body Irradiation (TBI) is considered myeloablative above 500 to 600 centiGray
(cGy). There is extensive experience with lower dose TBI with fludarabine in
nonmyelobalative conditioning, usually at [ADDRESS_270842] myeloablative Mel 140 mg/m2/1200 cGy
TBI regimen. We therefore consider the dosing range of our regimen to lie within the
parameters that define "reduced intensity" and to be a regimen that will not generate
excess TRM.
Trial Design:
A total of up to [ADDRESS_270843] stage of accrual (41 evaluable patients), data will be
reviewed to decide if the study should be terminated due to unacceptable toxicity.
Schedule:
Fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on days -5 to -2 (4 total doses)
Melphalan 75 mg/m2 on day -2 (1 total dose)
TBI 400 cGy (two fractions of 200 cGy each) on day -1

1. INTRODUCTION
Early allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT), beginning in the late
1960s, utilized a high-dose pretransplant preparative (or conditioning) regimen to deliver
myeloablative anti-leukemic treatment. The fully myeloablative cyclophosphamide plus
total body irradiation (TBI) regimens pi[INVESTIGATOR_225202], et al resulted in donor cell
engraftment but still resulted in small level of relapse.1 Although increasing the dose of
conditioning intensity reduced relapse rates, overall survival was not improved because
of higher non relapse mortality or treatment related mortality (TRM).2 Regimen related
toxicities (RRT) limited the application of conventional allogeneic HSCT to patients less
than 50-[ADDRESS_270845] had a potentially curative graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect in addition to the
anti-leukemic action of the myeloablative conditioning regimen. Leukemic relapse was
higher in patients who do not develop acute or chronic graft versus host disease, " who
undergo syngeneic (identical twin) transplant6"[ADDRESS_270846] and eradicate the relapsed
disease.10"[ADDRESS_270847].
RIT regimens are characterized by: 1) Reversible myelosuppression and autologous
hematopoietic recovery without allogeneic stem cell support (usually within 28 days). 2)
Mixed chimerism in a proportion of patients early after transplant. 3) Low rates of non-
hematologic toxicity. We now have over a decade of data pertaining to reduced
intensity conditioning regimens and over 10,[ADDRESS_270848] been
reported worldwide.

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: [ADDRESS_270849] with varying immunoabiative and myeloablative
potential. The allogeneic conditioning regimen can be reduced in intensity yet still ^
achieve lymphoid and myeloid engraftment. Initially, up to 17% of patients conditioned
with 200 cGy low-dose TBI alone rejected the transplant,18 but the incidence was
decreased to < 3% with the addition of fludarabine (Flu).19 Rejection rates for Flu-based
conditioning regimens are <5% suggesting that Flu (120-200 mg/m ) can play a critical
role in the establishment of engraftment in RIC transplantation. Flu, as the
immunosuppressive component of the conditioning, has been successfully combined
with variety of other agents (TBI or alkylating agents) to create regimens of different
intensities. Of the alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide, busulfan and melphalan have
been frequently used. Cyclophosphamide is the most immunosuppressive; whereas
busulfan and melphalan provide greater degrees of cytoreduction. FluCy is extremely
immunoablative but not very stem cell toxic. Using the standard FluCy regimen, Childs
et al showed that donor T-cell engraftment precedes myeloid engraftment and that GvHD
and GvL effects only occurred after full donor T-cell chimerism.[ADDRESS_270850], the
Seattle group, using low-dose TBI regimens reported the early donor myeloid
engraftment, followed later by T-cell engraftment, demonstrating that the regimen was
more myelosuppressive than immunosuppressive. ' '
RIT is generally used when conventional myeloablative conditioning would not be
tolerated (due to age or comorbidities) or when conventional myeloablative conditioning
is not required (bone marrow failure states, indolent malignancies). The primary
measure of efficacy of RIT is the ability to allow safe transplantation.
Consequently, a TRM <20% is conventionally considered an appropriate measure
of efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning regimens.
RIT is dramatically safer in patients who are ineligible for standard myeloablative
conditioning regimen because of advanced age or co-morbid illness. The Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI) has been used to evaluate outcomes in myeloablative and RIT
and has proven useful in predicting TRM and overall survival in related and unrelated^
transplants in a group of patients who are increasingly older and heavily pretreated.
However the CCI lacks sensitivity; only 35% of RIT patients had co-morbidities
identifiable by [CONTACT_225250] 12% for myeloablative transplants. A recent refinement has
been the validated HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) which is more
discriminant than the CCI at low scores.[ADDRESS_270851] a 2-year TRM of 40-43%; in contrast the remaining 72% of patients had a
pretransplant HCT-CI of [ADDRESS_270852] a 2-year TRM between 9-27%.
First generation RIT regimens (FluCy, Flu/ 200cGyTBI and Flu/Bu) have proven to be
reliable in donor engraftment, and in reducing TRM. Slow growing malignancies and

Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2, 10/7/14 Page 17 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: [ADDRESS_270853] experienced high rates of progression and
relapse in the myeloid malignancies (AML/CML/MDS).26 29 These increased rates in
progression and relapse can be attributed either to inadequate cytoreduction (such as with
FluCy) or slow achievement of complete donor lymphoid chimerism, a prerequisite for
GvL (such as FIu/200cGyTBI, the Seattle regimen). Consequently, further improvement
in RIT requires greater cytoreduction (without increasing toxicity) to control the
underlying disease until GvL is exerted and/or to hasten the onset of GvL by [CONTACT_225251].30 Newer generation RIT regimens
are being developed by [CONTACT_225252]/200cGyTBI for greater cytoreduction. The Flu/Bu/TBI conditioning regimen is
reported to be safe with 25% day 180 TRM and 50% 1 year overall survival rate. The
incidence of relapse at 3 years is still high at 25% with a low 25% 3 year progression free
survival (PFS).31,[ADDRESS_270854]-transplant lung toxicity is a concern when
combining busulfan and TBI due to the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_225203]. Melphalan is
the alternative myeloablative chemotherapy that can be combined with Flu/TBI to
improve cytoreduction. The overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_225204], melphalan, and TBI
have are immunosuppression and myelosuppression which are both desired in HSCT.
To date, there is no published data using FluMelTBI RIT conditioning regimen.
We are currently completing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_225205] (1 118807) using the novel combination of
fludarabine, low dose melphalan (50 mg/m2), and low dose TBI (400 cGy). In this novel
regimen, we intensified the Flu/200cGyTBI regimen because of high relapse rate and
added melphalan and a higher dose of TBI for improved disease control.
Fludarabine, a purine nucleoside analog is an important component of reduced intensity
regimens because of its potent immunosuppressive effects at doses ranging from 120-200
mg/m2 over 4 or 5 days. Melphalan is an alkylating agent. Doses above 140 mg/m are
considered myeloablative. In our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_225206], we examined a low dose melphalan of 50 mg/m in
combination with fludarabine (40 mg/m2/day x 4 days) and low dose TBI
(FluMelTBI) (Protocol No. 1-118807).
Forty six patients have been accrued on 1-118807. The study did not meet the early
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_225207] 3 planned interim analyses of safety. We compared the day
100 TRM, 1 year TRM, day 100 PFS and 1 year PFS of FluMelTBI to our historical
data with other RIT regimens: FluCy and FluMel (Table 1). The day 100 TRM
with FluMelTBI is low at 11% compared to our historical data with other RIT
regimens (see Table 1 and Figure 1A). The FluCy regimen has a day 100 TRM rate
of 10% which is lower than the 16% day 100 TRM rate seen with FluMel
(fludarabine, total dose 125 mg/m2 and melphalan total dose 140 mg/m2). The
FluMelTBI regimen has a lower one year TRM (22%) compared to the FluMel (one
year TRM=33%) and FluCy (one year TRM=33%) regimens (Figure IB). The

median age of patients in 1-118807 FIu/Mel/TBI is 10 years older than patients
receiving FluMel on RP 98-15 (58 vs. 48 years old), indicating that FluMelTBI is
likely better tolerated than FluMel especially in older patients. Although the FluCy
day 100 TRM is low, the Day 100 PFS is lower at 66% compared to FluMel (74%)
and FluMelTBI (81%), indicating poor disease control with FluCy. The 1-year PFS
is similar for the FluMel and FluMelTBI regimens (52 and 49%, respectively), both
of which are higher than FluCy (27%) (see Table 1 and Figure 2).

Based on these results, FIuMel/TBI has an acceptable TRM rate, but to improve
disease control, this new phase II trial increases the melphalan dose from 50 mg/m
to 75 mg/m2 with the intention to improve the cytoreductive effect and decrease the
risk of disease relapse. The role of fludarabine is immunoablative, melphalan is
cytoreductive while the TBI is expected to be both immunoablative as well as
cytoreductive. Melphalan is dosed in a manner to obtain synergy with fludarabine.
This study will build on our previous experience on Clinical Trial 118807 which utilized
a lower dose of melphalan.
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_225208] (1 118807), the percentage of patients who achieved
complete donor lymphoid chimerism on day 30 and day 100 was 83% and 90%,
respectively (Table 2). We expect to improve the time to development of complete
donor lymphoid chimerism with the increased melphalan dose.

Table 2. Peripheral Blood Lymphoid and Myeloid Chimerism Testing as of May 12
2011. Lymphoid and myeloid chimerism testing was performed on peripheral blood.
Peripheral white blood cells were separated by [CONTACT_398]3 (T cell, lymphoid) and CD33
(myeloid) isolation. There are [ADDRESS_270855] day 30 chimerism testing results. The level of sensitivity is 5%. Ninety-
five percent and higher is considered complete chimerism. Most patients who did not
have chimerism performed had serious medical problems and the chimerism testing was
delayed. For Day [ADDRESS_270856] not yet been tested but are beyond day 100. A total of 31 patients had day
100 chimerism testing results. We consider this engraftment rate to be excellent for a
reduced intensity regimen.
Low dose TBI- TBI will be administered at 400 cGy (two fractions of 200 cGy). TBI
doses ranging between 200 and 500 cGy are well tolerated and nonmyeloablative.
Fractionation enables tissue recovery and reduces toxicity.
In combination, the dose intensity of the study regimen (measured in terms of the
cumulative cytotoxic potential of the Mel and TBI components) is still less than half that
of the standard, fully ablative Mel 140/TBI 1200 cGy regimen.35'[ADDRESS_270857] experience using this combination at a lower dose of melphalan (50

mg/m2). Potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] "toxicities" are immunosuppression and
myelosuppression, both of which are desirable in an allogeneic transplant. There is a
known risk of mild mucositis from the combination of melphalan and TBI, both of which
continue to be dosed at half of the standard myeloablative dose. The mucositis in I-
118807 has been very low.
2. INDICATIONS FOR RIT IN VARIOUS DISEASE STATES
RIT now has an established role in therapeutic strategies for acute and chronic
leukemias, bone marrow failure states (aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndromes), lymphomas, myeloma, second transplant
and immunodeficiencies.
2.1. Bone Marrow Failure States and other non-malignant hematologic or immunologic
disorders requiring transplantation
These are preferentially treated with RIT rather than conventional myeloablative HSCT.
Primary allogeneic HSCT is appropriate for selected patients with severe aplastic
anemia, PNH, and related marrow failure disorders, certain congenital platelet or
neutrophil disorders, congenital immunodeficiencies.37"43,83 Patients with chromosomal
breakage syndromes (such as Fanconi Anemia) or Dyskeratosis Congenita can tolerate
only very low doses of radiation or chemotherapy due to poor DNA repair capacity.
These patients will be excluded from this study.
2.2. AML
Less than 20% of adults > [ADDRESS_270858] complete remission (CR1) will
achieve a 3-year DFS with conventional chemotherapy-based consolidation.44 While
conventional risk factors like cytogenetics and antecedent hematological disorder plays a
role, age does appear to be an independent variable.45^[ADDRESS_270859].48'[ADDRESS_270860] for
patients as soon as they progress to more advanced disease (Int-2 or higher IPSS score).
It is estimated that only about 5% of MDS patients are eligible to receive myeloablative
alloHSCT because of age and other exclusions. RIT may be able to reduce the TRM in
this group of patients and allow for wider application.
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2,10/7/14 Page 24 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: [ADDRESS_270861]. RIT may
be able to reduce the TRM in this group of patients.51"53
2.5. NHL
Reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation has a definite role in the treatment of
defined subgroups of patients with high-risk NHL with or without a prior autologous
transplant.5 Although aggressive relapse of NHL is not seen frequently as with myeloid
malignancies, nevertheless, there is a substantial incidence of relapse in NHL with
reduced intensity transplantation.55,56 This supports efforts to improve on the current
Flu/Cy protocol by [CONTACT_225253]-reductive capability.
2.6. Hodgkin disease
Approximately 50% of patients with relapsed and progressive disease after autologous
HSCT can be rescued by a RIT.[ADDRESS_270862] without high TRM.60"62 The
usual approach is to utilize RIT for selected younger patients with well-matched donors
either right after auto transplant ("auto-allo") or after relapse from an auto-transplant. A
phase III trial has demonstrated improved overall and disease-free survivals in newly
diagnosed myeloma for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] a hematopoietic stem-cell autograft followed by a
stem-cell allograft from an HLA-identical sibling versus a standard tandem autologous
A3transplant.
2.8. Non-hematologic Malignancy
Patients with solid tumors will be excluded from the current protocol.
2.9. Second Allogeneic Transplants
Second allogeneic transplantation is often offered for relapse after a first allogeneic or
autologous transplant and for graft failure. Higher conditioning intensities when used in
a second transplant are associated with high rate of RRT and TRM. Therefore, a RIT
regimen is an appropriate treatment option for these patients.
2.10. Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) Transplants
TRM in well matched unrelated donor transplants now approximates that of related
transplants because of recent advances in supportive care including the use of
fludarabine-based conditioning regimens, tacrolimus-based GvHD prophylaxis, use of

of reduced intensity conditioning, overall survival for MUD transplants approximated
that of sibling donor transplants.64

5. DONOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA/ STEM CELL SOURCE CRITERIA
5.1. Compatibility at the four most informative HLA loci: A, B, C and DRB1 are important
for reducing the risk of GVHD and successful transplant outcomes. The A, B, C and
DRB1 loci comprise 8 possible alleles (a haplotype being inherited from each parent).
One additional locus, HLA-DQ, is also typed to ascertain haplotypes and assist in the
search for a compatible donor; however mismatching at DQ has not been shown to be
associated with adverse outcomes. High resolution molecular typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (at the allele level)
is now the standard of care for unrelated donor searches and allows greater refinement of
the search strategy.
5.2. Matched Related Donor: A single antigen mismatch at A, B, or the DR transplant from a
family member is associated with a higher risk of GVHD but similar overall survival
when compared to full identity at these 3 regions. Related donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225209] 5 of 6 HLA antigens (A, B, DRB1).
5.3. Unrelated Donor: When evaluating patients for unrelated donor transplant, the higher
degree of matching, the lower risk of GvHD. The A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 loci,
comprising 10 possible antigen (with alleles), will be typed for all unrelated transplants.
Given the higher risk of TRM in mismatched transplants, RIT is often the best way to
mitigate the risk. Data from the National Marrow Donor Program makes it possible to
estimate the risk of donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225210]. The
higher risk from HLA-mismatching must be balanced against the clinical urgency and
the patient's risk by [CONTACT_83558]. At this time, antigen level mismatches at DQB1
do not affect outcomes and will not be used for matching purposes for donor seclection.
Thus, the matching required will be at the HLA A, B, C and DRB1 (8 loci). For this
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE

protocol, a single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B, or C, with or without additional single
allele level mismatch may participate in this protocol for voluntary unrelated donors
(blood or marrow).
5.4. Donor must be healthy and have nonreactive test results for all infectious disease assays
as required by [CONTACT_225256]. Donors who screen seropositive for hepatitis
and/or syphilis must be cleared by [CONTACT_225257].
5.5. The donor must have no uncontrolled cardiopulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic or
psychiatric disease to render donation unsafe.
5.6. The donor (or parent if minor) must give informed consent for peripheral blood stem cell
collection or bone marrow collection.
5.7. Syngeneic donors are not eligible.
5.[ADDRESS_270867] poor peripheral venous access, may require central venous line
placement for stem cell apheresis.
6. TRIAL DESIGN AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
This trial is designed as an open label, non-randomized, single institution study. The primary
objective of this study is estimation of the true population TRM rate by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_270868]

6.1. Descriptive analyses
Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and relative frequencies will be computed for all
categorical variables. Numeric variables will be summarized using simple descriptive statistics
such as the mean, standard deviation and range. A variety of graphical techniques will also be
used to display data, ex. histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc.
6.2. Accrual
The projected accrual is approximately 2-[ADDRESS_270869] 12 months after recruitment completion. The total study duration will be 5 years.

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
6.3. Efficacy analysis
The primary objective of this one-arm Phase II trial is to assess the day 100 TRM rate of the
study treatment as compared to historical control. The day 100 TRM for the historical
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FluCy) is 10% but it has a high day 100 rate of disease
progression at 20%. The day 100 TRM for fludarabine/melphalan 140 mg/m2 (FluMel) is 16%
with 9% disease progression rate at day 100. The day 100 TRM from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_225211] 50 mg/m2 melphalan (protocol No. 1-118807) is 11%, however, the day 100 rate of disease
progression rate is still somewhat high at 11%. This protocol increases the melphalan dose from
50 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 to provide better disease control which may result in a higher TRM than
10% but less than 20%. The sample size calculation is based on testing the hypotheses
concerning the proportion of the population who experience a TRM at [ADDRESS_270870] who experience a TRM by [CONTACT_4475]
100 after the beginning of treatment. A true rate of more than 20% is considered unacceptable.
A rate of less than 10% is considered promising and evidence of such will deem the treatment
worthy of further study. The null and alternative hypotheses corresponding to the design are
tf0:/7>20%,
Ha'.p< 20%.
A total of up to [ADDRESS_270871] disease progression before day 100 are considered non-evaluable
and will be excluded for TRM analysis. Non-evaluable patients will be replaced. The study
design will be a Kepner-Chang Type II Phase II (2004) design that proceeds in two stages and
stops early only for futility. At the end of the first stage of accrual (41 evaluable patients), data
will be reviewed to decide if the study should be terminated due to unacceptable toxicity.
Stage 1: If [ADDRESS_270872] patient in
Stage 1 is enrolled, study enrollment may be halted until TRM status at 100 days is evaluated in
all 41 patients.
Stage 2: We will accrue 40 additional evaluable patients. If 10 or less of the total of 81
evaluable patients experience a TRM at day 100, it will be concluded that p is less than 20%
and that the therapy is worthy of further study; otherwise, it will be concluded that there is no
evidence to suggest that the therapy is associated with acceptable transplant related toxicity.
With this design, the probability is bounded above by 4.9% of falsely concluding that the true
TRM rate is less than 20% and 80.9% is the probability of correctly concluding acceptable
toxicity when the true TRM rate is 10%.

baseline, day 30, day 100 and 1 year by [CONTACT_225263][INVESTIGATOR_225212]-specific immunity (CMV dextramer).
8. TREATMENT PLAN:
8.1. STEM CELL COLLECTION
Fresh or frozen peripheral blood stem ceils (PBSCs) may be utilized. Donors will
receive 10 micrograms/kilogram G-CSF daily subcutaneously, starting on transplant day
-5. The dose will be rounded to nearest vial size if possible (i.e. 300 micrograms or 480
micrograms). Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells will be collected by [CONTACT_225264] "-1" and again on day "0", to achieve a minimum target dose of 2 x 10
CD34+ cells/kilogram of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]. Newer stem cell mobilizing agents (such as
plerixafor) may be substituted or added to G-CSF if they are FDA-approved. PBSCs
will be unmanipulated with the exception of red cell depletion. CD3+ and CD34+ cell
counts as fractions of the total nucleated cells (TNC) will be determined according to
established institutional flow cytometry protocols.
PBSCs or Bone Marrow harvest for stem cells are acceptable. The target and minimum
doses for bone marrow harvest will be 3 x 108 and 1 x 108 nucleated cells per kilogram
of patient body weight respectively. Bone marrow stem cells will be unmanipulated with
the exception of red cell depletion..
Donor lymphocyte collection: donor lymphocytes will not be routinely collected using
this protocol. When donor lymphocytes are required for clinical reasons , they will be
collected and administered on the RPCI donor lymphocyte protocol.

8.2.3. Melphalan Melphalan 75 mg/m2 (actual body weight) is infused over 30 minutes
following fludarabine on day -2.
8.2.4. Total Body Irradiation (TBI):
Total Body Irradiation shall be delivered using a nominal photon beam energy of no less
than 4 MV. Dynamic or static fields may be used. However, the patient should be
entirely included within the dynamic or static treatment field. Lung shields are to be
applied in pairs (both AP & PA) with evenly weighted mid-plane dose from each field.
When necessary, lung shields can be combined with open (non-shield) fields during the
same fraction to achieve the required mid-plane and lung dose. Dose heterogeneity
resulting from lung transmission will be assessed using AAPM report number 17
[TG#29], "The physical aspects of total and half-body photon irradiation".
We shall deliver, per fraction of TBI, [ADDRESS_270874] at the level of the
umbilicus or pelvis, whichever region is thicker. Tissue compensators or other devices
shall be used to optimize dose homogeneity within +/- 5 % of the prescribed dose. Dose
homogeneity will be assessed at a minimum of six mid plane points at a) head, at largest
diameter b) neck, at the level of thyroid notch, c) chest, at the xyphoid process, d)
umbilicus or pelvis, whichever is thicker, e) mid thigh, and f) mid-calf. Optional dose
points will be located at g) knee, h) ankle, and i) umbilicus or pelvis, whichever is
thinner. In addition, a set of lung shields, or an equivalent device, shall be used to
ensure that the lungs will receive within 90 to 100 % of the prescribed dose per fraction.
The dose rate at the prescription point shall be between [ADDRESS_270875] six hours apart.
8.2.5. Hydration regimens per clinicians' discretion.
8.2. Supportive medications: Antiemetics, antimicrobials, etc. will be used according to
BMT standard of care.
8.3. GvHD PROPHYLAXIS
GvHD prophylaxis will be tacrolimus-based (FK506 orTacro)78'79with micro-dose
methotrexate (MTX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as per the BMT SOP.
Cyclosporine may be substituted for tacrolimus in case of intolerance and dosed per
BMT SOP.

8.3.1. tacrolimus (FK506): Starting dose will be 0.015 mg/kg (ideal body weight or actual if
less than ideal) PO every 12 hours or IV equivalent, from day -1. The tacrolimus dose
will be adjusted to target levels between 5-15 ng/ml. In patients who are unable to take
oral tacrolimus, the intravenous dose is generally 1/3 of the oral dose every 12 hours. In
the absence of GvHD or recurrent disease, tacrolimus will continue until day 60 (for
patients at high relapse risk) or until day 100 (low relapse risk) and then taper over 4 to 6
months. Relapse risk is defined in the BMT Program's SOP on GvHD prophylaxis.
8.3.2. 2Mycophenolate mofeti! (MMF)/(Cellcept®)80: The dose will be 1000 milligrams orally
every 8 hours or 1500 milligrams intravenously every 6 hours for adults. For pediatric
patients the dose will be 600 mg/m2 orally or IV every 8 hours (maximum dose is 1000
mg/dose). Determination of intravenous and oral doses were based on pharmacokinetic
levels and calculations to achieve total mycophenolic acid area under the plasma
concentration-versus-time curve (AUG) between 30 and 60 microgram/milliliter to
prevent graft rejection and graft versus host disease.81,[ADDRESS_270876]. G.
Fetterly (unpublished data). Thus, the intravenous dosing is higher based on measured
levels. The drug is inactivated by [CONTACT_225265], only higher levels of the inactivated metabolite. The reason for
the lower oral dose is gastrointestinal intolerance at doses higher than 1000 mg per
mg/m2 every 8 hours. The MMF starts on day -1 and, in the absence of GvHD or
recurrent disease, will continue until day 60 and then stop without taper. MMF may be
withheld at the discretion of the attending physician for patients with cytopenias or other
toxicities that are thought to be related to the MMF. The clinical team should attempt to
restart this medication when it is thought to be clinically safe.
8.3.3. Methotrexate (MTX): 2.5 milligrams/m2 (micro dose) IV on days 1, 3 and 6 will be
given for GVHD prophylaxis.
8.4. SUPPORTIVE CARE RECOMMENDATIONS
Prior to initiating therapy, placement of a multi-lumen indwelling silastic catheter is
required, preferably a non-tunnel!ed 5 lumen catheter.
Patients will receive full supportive care, including transfusions of irradiated blood and
blood products, growth factors, antibiotics, anti-emetics, oral care, etc., when
appropriate. The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and the dates of treatment should be
recorded on the flow sheets.
8.4.1. Mucosal evaluation and care: Mucositis is expected to be mild to moderate with a RIT
regimen. Stomatitis and esophagitis due to herpes virus may be confused with drug-

(SOP) for an allogeneic transplant patient.
8.4.2. Antifungal prophylaxis: Antifungal prophylaxis will follow the BMT SOP for allogeneic
transplant patients.
8.4.3. Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis: Anti-PCP prophylaxis should be given
according to the RPCI BMT standard operating procedure (SOP) for an allogeneic
transplant patient.
8.4.4. CMV Infections: Surveillance and treatment for CMV will follow RPCI BMT standard
operating procedure (SOP) for allogeneic transplant patients. Surveillance for CMV by
[CONTACT_225266] +100 and then PRN (as
needed). Patients with positive CMV antigenemia should receive induction and
maintenance treatment as per the RPCI BMT SOP. A CMV level of 1 or less may be
repeated on the next available weekday before initiating therapy and if negative, the
patient may be screened again in a week. Treatment dosing will be adjusted for
hematological and renal toxicity. CMV surveillance will start no later than day +21
unless patient has not engrafted.
8.4.5. For patients who are pancytopenic prior to transplant, antimicrobial screening
prophylaxis should continue through the transplant.
8.4.6. Anti-bacterial propylaxis: Patients will receive anti-bacterial prophylaxis during the
transplant period as per the RPCI BMT SOP.
8.4.6. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis will follow the RPCI BMT SOP.
8.4.7. Sinusoidal occlusive syndrome, also known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD)
prophylaxis will follow the BMT SOP.
8.5. Allogeneic Stem Cell Reinfusion (Appendix V)
On Day 0 blood or marrow hematopoietic stem cells will be infused. The minimum
PBSC dose is 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225213] 1 x 108 nucleated cells/ kilogram of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593].
8.6. Chimerism Analysis
Chimerism analysis is clinically useful and important for this study. Samples for
chimerism analysis will be obtained on all donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225214].

After transplant, serial samples of blood and marrow will be analyzed for chimerism
analysis as per the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory SOP. Lineage specific (separate
lymphoid and myeloid) chimerism will be analyzed in blood at the following time points
(+/- 7 days): day 30, day 100 and then at unscheduled intervals until full donor
chimerism is attained. Unseparated chimerism may also be analyzed in bone marrow
(for leukemia and patients with other malignancies if bone marrow was involved
previously) whenever a bone marrow is performed. Peripheral blood will be collected in

Patients not converting to 100% donor T-cell chimerism by [CONTACT_4475] + 180 and/or showing
signs of progression of disease after FK506 and MMF withdrawal and/or with refractory
viral infection, will be evaluated for DLL Patients who have active GvHD will not
receive DLL
8.7. Immune Reconstitution
Peripheral blood will be collected at baseline (prior to transplant), day 30, day 100 and
one year after transplant for evaluation of immune reconstitution (+/- 7 days). Immune
reconstitution will be measured by [CONTACT_225267] T cells (CD3, CD4,
CDS, yS, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD27, HLADr,CD31, CD25, CD127), B cells (CD19,

9. POTENTIAL TOXICITIES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT
Patients will be managed in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Safety will be monitored on an
ongoing basis and discussed, graded and recorded in weekly outcome rounds.
9.1. Management of Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD):
Approximately 80% of patients will exhibit some manifestation of GvHD. Severe acute
GvHD (grade II-III) may occur in up to 20% of patients with an overall mortality of 40-
80% due to GvHD and its complications. The risk of severe or fatal GvHD is increased
for older patients and for patients receiving stem cells from partially-matched donors. A
chronic form of GvHD is expected to occur in up to 40% of patients who survive beyond
[ADDRESS_270879] measures for
prevention and treatment of GvHD will be followed.
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2,10/7/14 Page 39 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
Patients with symptomatic grade 1 acute GvHD of the skin will be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_225215]. Grade II or greater acute GvHD will be treated with high dose
methylprednisolone 1-2 milligrams/kilogram daily for 10-14 days. The goal will be at
Img per kg at 10 days followed by [CONTACT_225269] a maintenance dose of
up to 0.25 mg/kg/day, continued for at least 2 weeks from the disappearance of all
symptoms of GvHD. FK506/MMF will be maintained or increased during active
aGvHD. Refractory GvHD will be treated as per attending physician's discretion and/or
BMT SOP.
9.2. Regimen Related Toxicity (Bearman Criteria; WHO mucositis scale; APPENDICES I
and II).
9.2.1. Cardiac:
Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease are at significant risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_225216]. Studies to be obtained when clinically indicated include
EKG (to compare voltage to pretreatment EKG), radionuclide ventriculogram, and/or
echocardiography.
9.2.2. Renal:
Many of the agents used in this study can cause renal toxicity, which can be minimized
by [CONTACT_225270], avoidance of exposure of multiple nephrotoxic drugs where
clinically possible, appropriate drug monitoring and dose adjustment. Kidney damage is
usually reversible, but severe cases may require dialysis.
9.2.3. Pulmonary:
"Engraftment syndrome" consisting of hypoxia, pulmonary effusions and/or infiltrates
may be seen at the time of donor cell engraftment and should be treated promptly with
methylprednisolone 2 milligrams/kilogram daily followed by [CONTACT_225271].
Based on our previous protocol, the risk of fatal idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis is
estimated to be <10%. Patients with hypoxia or hypoxia with ambulation should be
evaluated as soon as possible by [CONTACT_3610]. Whenever possible, histologic confirmation
of the diagnosis should be attempted by [CONTACT_97902], transbronchial or open-
lung biopsy. This would help to exclude infectious causes (cytomegalovirus/fungal) or
confirm the diagnosis of hemorrhage.
9.2.4. Hepatic:
Moderate toxicity can occur. More severe, possibly fatal, liver toxicity rarely occur,
usually in the form of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), also known as veno-
occlusive disease (VOD). With these study regimens the incidence of fatal liver toxicity
should be well less than 10%. Management of liver toxicity is with continued

Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2,10/7/14 Page 40 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: [ADDRESS_270880] supportive and symptomatic measures. The clinical
team should avoid exposure of patients to other hepatotoxic agents.
9.2.5. CNS:
Fludarabine can cause weakness, paraesthesias or peripheral neuropathies, visual or
auditory impairment, and/or mental status changes such as confusion, agitation,
depression, or coma. Some antibiotics, which may be needed to treat infections during
the period of low white blood cell counts, can cause Vlllth cranial nerve damage
resulting in hearing loss (especially high-frequency tones) and dizziness which may be
permanent. To minimize this possibility, antibiotic levels will be monitored.
9.2.6. Mucositis:
Many patients will experience mild to moderate stomatitis and dysphagia. Adequate
pain relief often requires parental narcotics. Prevention requires aggressive oral hygiene
as per RPCIBMT SOPs.
9.2.7. Nausea/Vomiting:
Many patients will experience moderate to severe nausea and vomiting. All patients
should receive vigorous antiemetic treatment as per RPCI BMT SOP. At or after
neutrophil engraftment, the development of nausea and vomiting must prompt evaluation
for GvHD.
9.2.8. Diarrhea:
Most patients will experience moderate to severe diarrhea in the first three weeks, which
responds to standard symptomatic therapy. Appropriate studies are needed to exclude
infectious causes of diarrhea, especially C. difficile. At or after neutrophil engraftment,
diarrhea must prompt evaluation for GvHD.
9.3. Other Toxicities:
Infections:
Viral infections (CMV, EBV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_225217], influenza virus and
parainfluenza virus, BK virus, adenovirus), fungal infections (candida and mould) and
bacterial infections are commonly expected in the setting of an immunocompromised
host, chemotherapy administration and delayed immune reconstitution. These will be
managed according to the RPCI BMT SOP.
Hematologic:
Major ABO incompatibility (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225218]. donor RBCs) or minor ABO incompatibility
(donor vs. recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225219]) or both may result in severe hemolysis. ABO incompatible
transplants will be identified in advance and will be treated according to the RPCI BMT
SOP.

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
All blood products will be irradiated (2500 cGy) to prevent GvHD. Infection prophylaxis
and treatment will be given according to RPCIBMT SOPs and standard accepted
medical practice. With prophylactic platelet transfusions, the risk of death from
hemorrhage is <5%.
Skin:
Generalized erythroderma can occur with painful palms and soles and superficial
desquamation at sites of mechanical trauma. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_225220]. Severe cases may require a brief course (3-5 days) of systemic
corticosteroids. Long lasting hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_225221].
Hair:
Some patients, particularly those receiving melphalan and total body irradiation will
experience total (reversible) alopecia.
Secondary malignancy:
The cumulative exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation increases the risk of
developi[INVESTIGATOR_225222] a second cancer. The incidence of leukemia is probably
approximately 5%.
Failure to engraft:
Autologous count recovery is the most likely outcome because this combination is sub-
myeloablative.
Toxicities of G-CSF (donor):
These toxicities may include bone pain, headache and myalgias. These can be treated
with non-narcotic and narcotic analgesics. Splenic rupture in donors with an enlarged
spleen and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_225223].
Toxicities of Apheresis (donor)
With apheresis the following discomforts may occur: tingling around mouth or in
fingers, feeling cold or feeling a pressure sensation in chest due to the blood thinner
(sodium citrate), feeling light-headed or fainting any time during or at the end of the
procedure, pain, bruising or infection at the point of the needle entry into the skin. A
reaction (such as a rash) to a drug is possible if the patient has an unknown allergy.
Blood loss (less than a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]) may rarely occur because of equipment problems which
make it impossible to return the blood to the donor. Air entering the blood stream
causing air to go to body organs (very rare risk because of safety measures used).

In the event the patient cannot undergo apheresis or had a poor hematopoietic stem cell
collection, a bone marrow harvest will be performed. The risks of the bone marrow
harvest include anesthesia (general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]), pain, infection and bleeding at bone
marrow harvest sites (posterior iliac crests bilaterally).

disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and liver failure. Tumor lysis syndrome,
complicating fludarabine monophosphate therapy has been observed, especially in
patients with advanced bulky disease. Opportunistic infections (protozoan, viral, fungal,
and bacterial) have been observed in both pre-treated patients receiving fludarabine and
in individuals receiving fludarabine combined with other agents (corticosteroids,
mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide).
10.2. Melphalan (Alkeran®):
An alkylating agent.
10.2.1 Availability:
Melphalan is commercially available as a powder for injection in 50 milligrams vials.
10.2.2. Storage & Stability:
Intact vials should be stored between 20 to 250C (68 to 770F) and protected from light.
Following reconstitution with sterile diluent, melphalan hydrochloride solution
containing 5 milligrams of melphalan per milliliters is stable for up to 60 minutes at
room temperature; this reconstituted solution should not be refrigerated since a
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_193909] 50C.

10.3. Tacrolimus (Prograf®);
Macrolide compound with potent immunosuppressant properties.
10.3.1. Storage & Stability:
Store tacrolimus capsules at controlled room temperature, 15-30oC (59-860F) (Prod Info
Prograf®, 1997). An extemporaneous suspension of tacrolimus with a final
concentration of 1 milligram/milliliter was stable for 56 days when it was stored at 24-
260C in glass or plastic amber prescription bottles.
10.3.2. Availability:
Tacrolimus is available for oral administration as capsules, containing the equivalent of
0.5, 1, or 5 milligrams of anhydrous tacrolimus and compounded oral suspension
containing the equivalent of 1 milligram/milliliter of anhydrous tacrolimus. For IV use,
tacrolimus is available as a sterile solution in 1 milliliter ampules containing the
equivalent of 5 milligrams of anhydrous tacrolimus per ml.
The oral absorption of tacrolimus is erratic and incomplete; absolute bio-availability is
approximately 25%. Peak serum levels are seen [ADDRESS_270885] ranged from 5 to 15 nanograms/milliliter.
Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized in the liver, with only small amounts of
unchanged drug (2% or less) being recovered in the urine. The elimination half-life of
tacrolimus is approximately 10 hours.
Tacrolimus suppresses both humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated immune responses.
The compound is chemically distinct from cyclosporine but both agents elicit similar
immunosuppressant effects. The immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus is, however,
more marked than that of cyclosporine.
10.3.3. Preparation: For IV use:
Tacrolimus concentrate for injection must be diluted prior to IV infusion. For IV
infusion, the concentrate is diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose injection
to a concentration of 4-20 micrograms/milliliter. Preparation of the solution in
polyethylene or glass containers allows storage for 24 hours beyond which unused
solution should be discarded. A plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) container should
not be used because stability of the solution is decreased and polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated
castor oil contained in the formulation may leach phthalates from PVC containers.
Tacrolimus concentrate for injection and diluted solutions of the drug should be
inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration
whenever solution and container permit.
For Oral use:
Tacrolimus 1 milligram/miUiiiter suspension is compounded using twenty-four 5
milligram capsules, 60 milliliters of simple syrup, and 60 milliliters of Oraplus®
suspension. Capsules are emptied into an 8 ounce amber bottle and dissolved in 8

milliliters of sterile water. Simple syrup and Oraplus® are added and shaken vigorously.
Storage is at room temperature for 56 days.
10.3.4. Administration:
Oral therapy should be started as soon as possible after transplantation at a dose of 0.015
miHigrams/kilogram (ideal body weight or actual if less than ideal) every [ADDRESS_270886]
of the oral dose administered every 12 hours.
10.3.5. Toxicity:
In patients receiving tacrolimus, 5% to 47% experienced anemia, 8% to 32% experienced
leukocytosis, and 14% to 24% experienced thrombocytopenia. Rare cases of
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia have been reported. Mild to moderate hypertension
was reported in 38% to 50% of patients receiving tacrolimus. Mild to moderate
hypertension is a common adverse effect associated with tacrolimus therapy. Chest pain
was reported in 19%. Antihypertensive therapy may be required. The most common
adverse effects of tacrolimus have involved the central nervous system, and include
headache (37% to 64%), tremors (48% to 56%), insomnia (32% to 64%), paresthesia
(17% to 40%); and dizziness (19%). Tremor and headache may respond to a dosage
reduction. Agitation, anxiety, confusion, seizures, depression, hallucinations, myoclonus,
neuropathy, psychosis, incoordination, and abnormal dreams have been reported in 3% to
15% of tacrolimus-treated patients. Hyperkalemia (13% to 45%), hypokalemia (13% to
29%), hypophosphatemia (49%), and hypomagnesemia (16% to 48%) have been
associated with tacrolimus therapy. In addition, hirsutism occurs only rarely with
tacrolimus. Hyperuricemia has been reported in greater than 3% of tacrolimus-treated
patients. Gastrointestinal adverse effects of tacrolimus have included nausea (32% to
46%), vomiting (14% to 29%), anorexia (7% to 34%), constipation (23% to 35%) and
diarrhea (37% to 72%). Gingival hyperplasia observed in patients treated with
cyclosporine has not been reported with tacrolimus therapy. Nephrotoxicity was
reported in 36% to 40% and 52% of liver and kidney transplant patients receiving
tacrolimus. Overt nephrotoxicity is usually seen early after transplantation and is
characterized by [CONTACT_225273] a decrease in urine output.
Hematuria has been reported in greater than 3% of tacrolimus-treated patients (Prod Info
Prograf®, 1997). Abnormal liver function tests have been reported in 6% to 36% of
patients receiving tacrolimus; ascites was reported in 7% to 27% of these patients.
Other miscellaneous effects that have occurred in clinical trials include pain (24% to
63%), fever (19% to 48%), asthenia (11% to 52%), back pain (17% to 30%), and
peripheral edema (12% to 36%). The incidence of hyperglycemia is 17% and may
require therapy with insulin. Other less frequently occurring effects (greater than 3%)
include abscess, chills, peritonitis, and photosensitivity reactions. Anaphylaxis has been
reported in a few patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus. Tacrolimus contains castor
oil which has been associated with anaphylaxis in other drugs containing castor oil
derivatives.

10.4. Mycophenolate (CellCept®, MMF):
A 2-morphoHnoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA), inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor.
10.4.1. Storage & Stability
The MMF powder for reconstitution and reconstituted solution should be stored at 25
degrees Celsius (C) (77 degrees Fahrenheit (F)); however, temperature excursions
between 15 to 30 degrees C (59 to 86 degrees F) are permitted (Prod Info CenCept(R),
2003e).
10.4.2. Availability and administration:
Mycophenolate is available for oral administration as capsules containing 250 milligrams
of mycophenolate mofetil, tablets containing 500 milligrams of mycophenolate mofetil,
and as a powder for oral suspension, which when constituted contains 200
milligrams/milliliter mycophenolate mofetil. Each vial of mycophenolate intravenous
contains the equivalent of 500 milligrams mycophenolate mofetil as the hydrochloride
salt. Reconstitution and dilution with 5% Dextrose Injection USP yields a solution of
mycophenolate mofetil, 6 milligrams/milliliter.
10.4.3. Clinica! Pharmacology:
Mechanism of Action: Mycophenolate mofetil is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_225225] A, which is the active metabolite. MPA is a
selective and uncompetitive, inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
(IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de-novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis
without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically
dependent for their proliferation on de- novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell
types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes.
MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and
allospecific stimulation.
10.4.4. Pharmacokinetics:
Oral absorption of the drug is rapid and essentially complete. MPA is metabolized to
form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG) which is not pharmacologically active.
10.4.5. Metabolism:
Following oral and intravenous dosing, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes complete
metabolism to MPA, the active metabolite. MPA is metabolized principally by
[CONTACT_225274] (MPAG) which is not
pharmacologically active. In vivo, MP AG is converted to MPA via enterohepatic
recirculation. Increased plasma concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil metabolites

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
(MPA 50% increase and MP AG about a 3-fold to 6-fold increase) are observed in
patients with renal insufficiency.
10.4.6. Excretion:
Orally administered radiolabeled mycophenolate mofetil resulted in complete recovery of
the administered dose, with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6%
recovered in feces. Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as
MPAG.
10.4.7. Contraindications:
Allergic reactions to mycophenolate have been observed; therefore, mycophenolate is
contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil,
mycophenolic acid or any component of the drug product. Mycophenolate intravenous is
contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Polysorbate 80 (TWEEN).
10.4.8. Toxicities:
The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate
include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher
frequency of certain types of infections. Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens
involving combinations of drugs, including mycophenolate, as part of an
immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_225226], particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and
duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.
Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection,
including opportunistic infections, fatal infections, and sepsis.
As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV
light should be limited by [CONTACT_225275] a sunscreen.
Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving
mycophenolate (2000 to 3000 milligrams daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in
controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, as
mycophenolate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in animals, it may cause fetal
harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Therefore, mycophenolate should not be
used in pregnant women unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the
fetus. It is recommended that mycophenolate therapy should not be initiated by [CONTACT_225276] a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained.
In patients receiving mycophenolate (2000 or 3000 milligrams) in controlled studies for
prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in
approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients.

Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2, 10/7/14 Page 48 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 10 3 / microliter] developed
in up to 2.0% of renal, up to 2.8% of cardiac, and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant
patients receiving mycophenolate 3000 milligrams daily respectively. If neutropenia
develops (ANC <1.3 x 10 3 / microliter), dosing with mycophenolate should be
interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient
managed appropriately. Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) has been
observed in approximately 3% of renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate
[ADDRESS_270887] rarely been observed.
10.5. METHOTREXATE (MIX):
Antimetabolite that interferes with DNA synthesis, repair and cellular replication
10.5.1. Availability and Stability:
Methotrexate LPF® Sodium (methotrexate sodium injection), Isotonic Liquid,
Preservative Free, for single use only, is available in 25 milligrams/milliliter, 2, 4, 8, and
10 milliliter vials, containing 50, 100, 200, and 250 milligrams of methotrexate
respectively. If desired, the solution may be further diluted immediately prior to use with
an appropriate sterile, preservative-free medium.
Methotrexate Sodium for Injection, Freeze Dried, Preservative Free, Low Sodium, for
single use only, is available in 20, 50, and 1000 milligrams vials, containing
approximately 0.14, 0.33 and 7 meq of sodium respectively. Reconstitute immediately
prior to use with an appropriate sterile, preservative-free medium.
Methotrexate Sodium Injection, Isotonic Liquid, Preservative Protected, is available in
25 milligrams/milliliter, 50, and [ADDRESS_270888] not be used for intrathecal or high dose therapy. If
desired, the solution may be further diluted with a compatible medium.
10.5.2. Dosage and Administration:
There is a wide range of dosing of methotrexate up to 10,000 mg per M2 over 15 to 30
minutes that would include leucovorin rescue. For this protocol, the dose of
methotrexate is very low and will not require a leucovorin rescue.
10.5.3. Toxicities:
Hematologic: myelosuppression [leukopenia (nadir 7 days), thrombocytopenia, anemia].
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2,10/7/14 Page 49 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
Hepatic: acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatic
toxicity. Chronic toxicity has generally occurred after prolonged use (generally 2 years
or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams.
Urogenital: severe nephropathy or renal failure, azotemia, cystitis, hematuria; defective
oogenesis or spermatogenesis, transient oligospermia, menstrual dysfunction and vagina!
discharge; infertility, abortion, fetal defects. Close attention to renal function including
adequate hydration, and urine alkalinization are essential for safe administration.
Gastrointestinal: gingivitis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
hematemesis, melena, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, enteritis. Should be used
with extreme caution in the presence of peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis.
Therapy may be discontinued if ulcerative stomatitis or other severe GI adverse reactions
occur.
Pulmonary: interstitial pneumonitis deaths have been reported, and chronic interstitial
obstructive pulmonary disease has occasionally occurred. Pulmonary symptoms or a
nonspecific pneumonitis may be indicative of a potentially dangerous lesion and require
interruption of treatment and careful investigation; infection needs to be excluded. This
lesion can occur at all dosages.
Skin: erythematous rashes, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491],
alopecia, ecchymosis, telangiectasia, acne, furunculosis.
Central Nervous System: headaches, drowsiness, blurred vision. There have been reports
of leukoencephalopathy following intravenous administration of methotrexate to patients
who have had craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25360]. Aphasia, hemiparesis, paresis, and convulsions
have also occurred following administration of methotrexate. Following low doses,
occasional patients have reported transient subtle cognitive dysfunction, mood alteration,
or unusual cranial sensations.
Other: opportunistic infection, arthralgia/myalgia, loss of libido/impotence, diabetes,
osteoporosis and sudden death. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been
reported.
11. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for continuous monitoring of the
safety of the study.
Patient Outcomes Rounds are held weekly on the transplant unit, at which time all BMT
patient care is reviewed, including:

Protocol Template Version Date: 29 December 2010, Amendment 2, 10/7/14 Page 50 of 68
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
Medications (chemotherapy for conditioning regimens; prophylactic, empi[INVESTIGATOR_225227]; graft-versus-host disease prophylactic and therapeutic
medications; and possible drug interactions).
Adverse events and/or adverse reactions to any medication, procedure, or other
treatment; reports are filed according to RPCI policy and procedure.
Regimen-related toxicity, based on Bearman toxicity grading, and/or Common Toxicity
Criteria (CTC) if the toxicity does not correlate with a Bearman grade.
Additional testing or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_225228], scans or xrays that will direct
therapeutic interventions.
Consent, a properly signed and dated transplant consent.
Patient Psychosocial Status, compliance issues that could compromise patient safety.
A pretransplant, a conference is held by [CONTACT_225277] a [ADDRESS_270889] a caregiver present at all times while the patient is an outpatient
up to 100 days following transplant. In addition, psychosocial evaluations are completed
on all transplant patients by [CONTACT_225278], to identify
any compliance issues.
Safety Monitoring, mandated by [CONTACT_225279]. These include daily physical examinations, clinical laboratory testing, routine
surveillance cultures, therapeutic drug level monitoring (i.e., Vancomycin, Tacrolimus,
Tobramycin, Cyclosporine, Sirolimus, Mycophenolate). They are found in the BMT
SOP. Patients who have been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225229]-related issues are resolved and they are returned to the care of
their referring physicians.
Performance Status, assignment of KPS/Lansky Score (Appendix VI)
Quality Assurance, the BMT Quality Assurance plan requires quarterly reporting to the
BMT Quality Assurance Committee, which in turn reports to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225230]. Indicators for BMT patient safety monitoring include:
¦ Patient complaints
¦ Reportable adverse events (serious)
¦ Bearman toxicity grade >3
¦ Variances in the delivery of standard care that do or do not result in a change in
practice
¦ Readmissions prior to day +[ADDRESS_270890] transplant
¦ Deaths occurring prior to day +[ADDRESS_270891] transplant

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: 1177110
¦ Engraftment of neutrophils and plateietes
Long Term Follow-up is conducted on all transplant patients even after they have
returned to the care of the referring physicians. An Annual Transplant Clinic has been
established, which provides care for allogeneic patients with chronic complications, as
well as assessments to identify clinical problems such as dental, bone, and psychosocial
complications.
BMT Patient Outcomes are reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research (CIBMTR), and/or the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP).
Registry reports are reviewed internally prior to submission to the respective registry.
These data are also entered into the RPCI BMT Database, from which patient outcomes
are assessed and reviewed on a regular basis. Regimen-related toxicities reported in this
fashion have resulted in a number of changes to transplant protocols since 1997, thus
decreasing toxicity and improving outcomes in a number of patient groups. Registry
reports also establish the efficacy of treatment as measured by [CONTACT_225280] +100 and on subsequent annual reports. The patients' medical records
serve as original source documents for all reporting. Audits are conducted every two to
three years by [CONTACT_225281].
12. REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM PROTOCOL AND ADVERSE EVENT
REPORTING (AER):
12.1. Removal From Protocol:
If the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health and/or the patient
no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the patient will be removed from
protocol treatment and placed on follow-up. In this event the reason for withdrawal will
be documented, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_225231],
survival, progression and relapse. Any patient with disease progression will be removed
from the protocol treatment and placed on follow-up. Document details, including last
staging on flow sheets and follow the patient for survival and secondary malignancies.
12.2. Expected Toxicity: (recorded in protocol consent form or manufacturer's literature).
Within 10 days of occurrence, written reports should be submitted to the IRB and the
protocol chairman in the following circumstances (Bearman toxicity):

8-2006%20BMT%20Standards.pdf
13.2. Study Endpoints:
The primary endpoint is Transplant Related Mortality in the first 100 days from day 0 of
the transplant. TRM is defined as death due to any cause except for disease progression.
13.3. Safety And Toxicity:
Safety will be evaluated on an ongoing basis with weekly outcome assessment and
grading for the first [ADDRESS_270893] transplant. Descriptive statistics will be used to
describe safety and other outcomes. Toxicity will be scored according to the Bearman
Criteria in Appendix I, oral mucositis by [CONTACT_225283], acute GvHD
according to the criteria in Appendix III and chronic GvHD by [CONTACT_225284].
13.4. Engraftment:
Neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first day in which ANC is > 0.5xl09/ liter for
three consecutive days. Platelet engraftment is the first day that platelets are >20 xl 09/
liter for seven consecutive days without transfusion support.
Engraftment is a dynamic process in RIT, and chimerism analysis will be performed at
regular intervals. Lineage specific (separate lymphoid and myeloid) chimerism will be
analyzed in blood at the following time points (+/- 7 days): day 30, day 100 and then at
unscheduled intervals till full donor chimerism is attained.
Primary engraftment failure is defined as lack of evidence of neutrophil or platelet
engraftment at day +35, confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy showing <5% cellularity in
the absence of persistent malignancy. Late graft failure will be defined as initial
neutrophil engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] +35 documented to be of donor origin followed by a drop

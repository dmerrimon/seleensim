  CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION  Efficacy 
The efficacy of CERC- 002 will be determined by [CONTACT_775106], the need 
for invasive ventilat ion, PaO2/FiO2, SOFA score, b ody temperature , and v iral load in 
nasopharyngeal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] . Apart from these tests, time to invasive ventilation, duration 
of ventilation support, duration of time in the ICU, duration of the time in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
and duration of time requiring O2 by [CONTACT_775107]. 
Safety 
The safety of CERC- 002 will be determined by [CONTACT_775108] , according to 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria (v 5.0) , findings 
on physical exam, and the results of ECGs and safety laboratory determinations.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The PK of CERC- 002 will be determined by [CONTACT_775109]- 002 at 
various time points after administrati on. 
Pharmacodynamics  
The PD will be determined by [CONTACT_775110] .  
Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity of CERC -002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431156].  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  All efficacy and safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Descriptive statistics for continuous data will include number of subjects  (n), mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  Summaries of change from 
baseline variables will include only subjects  who have both a baseline value and 
corresponding value at the timepoint of interest. Descriptive statistics for categorical 
data will include frequency and percentage.

  6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background and Rationale 
COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV] disease) 
COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus disease) is an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], caused by a novel 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO ) 
Emergency Committee declared COVID-[ADDRESS_1064669] all 
countries are affected. As of April 2020, [LOCATION_002] (US) has the highest number of COVID-19 
cases and deaths due to COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019‐nCoV, CSSE). 
The initial clinical sign of COVID‐19 that allowed the case detection was pneumonia 
(Chan et al, 2020). Complications of COVID-19 pneumonia include acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS), arrhythmia, shock, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, liver dysfunction, 
and secondary infection (Huang et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020). The main cause of mortality in 
COVID-19 appears to be dysregulated hyperimmune response causing cytokine storm, acute lung injury and ARDS. Fifteen to 20% of COVID-19 patients experience severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166141] ( Huang et al, 2020). 
Currently, there are no treatments to prevent progression of COVID-19 pneumonia to ARDS in 
patients with COVID-19. 
Role of LIGHT, an immunoregulatory cytokine, in viral infection 
An important immunoregulatory cytokine, LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxin, exhibits 
inducible expression and competes with herpes simplex virus [HSV] glycoprotein D for binding 
to herpes virus entry mediator [HVEM], a receptor expressed on T lymphocyte) is secreted in high 
levels during viral infection, which supports ARDS-related lung fibrosis and cytokine storm, but 
has not been studied in the patients with COVID-19 or other human coronavirus infections 
(Xu et al, 2019). Neutrophils and macrophages express high levels of LIGHT and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF ) and are a major source of these inflammatory cytokines (Kwon et al, 1997).  
LIGHT (also known as tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14) belongs to the TNF  
superfamily and is expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T cells, monocytes, macrophages and additional types 
of antigen presenting cells. LIGHT has a key role in the communication system which controls 
immune response. LIGHT activates two key receptors, HVEM and lymphotoxin β receptor 
(LTβR), both expressed on lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Early in infection, LIGHT released from neutrophils and macrophages bind cellular receptors, which causes inflammatory cell infiltration, 
releasing high level of TNF. LIGHT also has a co-stimulatory role in T cell activation driving 
proinflammatory and tissue damaging effects (Ware, 2008; Ware, 2009). An additional receptor 
for LIGHT is a decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), which binds LIGHT and interferes with its activity by [CONTACT_775113] (Steinberg et al, 2009; Wroblewski et al, 2003). In hyper 
inflammation and cytokine storm conditions, DcR3 is likely to be overwhelmed, generating high 
DcR3-free (active) LIGHT. 
Rationale for CERC-002, an anti-LIGHT antibody, in COVID-19 
While a primary focus of treatment of COVID‐19 is the development of appropriate antiviral and 
vaccination approaches, currently no established therapy exists. Agents targeting cytokine storm 
include cytokine‐directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including interleukin (IL)‐1 and IL‐6 antagonists; however, 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 21 of 51 
 
  there is no established single therapy for the treatment and/or prevention of acute lung injury 
associated with cytokine storm. The development of a safe and effective therapy for 
COVID-19-associated acute lung injury and ARDS could significantly reduce the mortality and 
post-infectious morbidity of this global pandemic and alleviate the severe strain placed on 
healthcare systems. 
LIGHT protein has been reported to be elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
of patients presenting severe pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_300618]. LIGHT levels correlate with 
disease severity; as disease progresses from minor to severe, LIGHT levels are elevated 
(Xu et al, 2019). In humans, LIGHT is functionally neutralized by [CONTACT_775114]3, which tightly binds 
LIGHT and inhibits its interactions with HVEM and LTβR.   
CERC-002 (formerly AEVI-002, MDGN-002) is an anti-LIGHT, fully human, monoclonal 
antibody (MAb), which binds to LIGHT at the DcR3 binding site. It is anticipated that neutralizing 
LIGHT using CERC-[ADDRESS_1064670] of CERC-002 on prevention of ARDS 
in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. 
6.2 Nonclinical Experience 
CERC-002 is a fully human immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) MAb specific to human LIGHT. 
CERC-002 binds human and cynomolgus monkey LIGHT with high affinity; there was no 
apparent binding of CERC-002 to LIGHT from any other species tested. In vitro, LIGHT-mediated 
chemokine release is comparably inhibited by [CONTACT_775115]-002 in a human or cynomolgus cell line. 
Based on these data, the monkey is considered to be the only relevant species for toxicological 
evaluation of CERC-002, and all toxicology studies are performed in cynomolgus monkeys. 
CERC-002 does not demonstrate any potential for off-target binding, cytokine release syndrome, 
or cytotoxicity. In a 2-month toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys using doses of 6, 30, and 
60 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) administered every 2 weeks, CERC-002 was well tolerated at all 
doses. Ventricular premature complexes were observed in 3 animals during electrocardiogram 
(ECG) evaluation; however, attribution to treatment is considered unlikely. The only test 
article-related microscopic finding was a minimal increase in incidence and severity of multifocal 
lymphocytic infiltration around small hypodermal vessels at the sites of SC administration and 
adjacent inguinal areas at 60 mg/kg per dose. As this finding is considered non-adverse, the no observed adverse effect level was the high dose of 60 mg/kg per dose. 
Toxicokinetic results showed that all dosed cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to CERC-002. 
CERC-002 was slowly absorbed with a time to maximum observed concentration (t
max) of 
approximately 24 to 144 hours. CERC-002 exposures increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, and CERC-002 exposure increased slightly during treatment. At the 60 mg/kg dose the 
maximum observed concentration (C
max) was 1,730 and 1,620 μg/mL, and the area under the curve 
(AUC) was 343,000 and 388,000 μg•h/mL for male and female cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. No significant gender effect was observed. 
Anti-CERC-002 antibodies were observed in drug-treated animals on Day 15 (6 of 10 at 6 mg/kg 
per dose; 3 of 10 at 30 mg/kg per dose; and 1 of 10 at 60 mg/kg per dose); and at Day 57 (3 of 4 
at 6 mg/kg per dose, 1 of 4 at 30 mg/kg per dose, and 0 of 4 at 60 mg/kg per dose). There was no 
clear impact of antidrug antibodies on CERC-002 toxicokinetics and exposure.

CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.[ADDRESS_1064671] of CERC-002 on secretion of 
Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) from cynomolgus 
monkey skin fibroblast cells stimulated with soluble recombinant cynomolgus LIGHT protein. 
CERC-002 inhibited cynomolgus LIGHT-induced secretion of RANTES from cynomolgus skin 
fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
5.67 nM.  
In the toxicokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys, results indicated that a CERC-002:LIGHT 
molar ratio of 1:2 was sufficient to inhibit LIGHT activity. All animals in the toxicology study had 
serum LIGHT concentrations below the limit of detection (62.5 pg/mL) prior to the start and at the 
end of the dosing period. The lowest serum CERC-002 concentration recorded in the 6 mg/kg per 
dose group on Day 15 (prior to administration of the second CERC-002 dose) was 26 μg/mL, 
indicating that at least a 6.9×104:1 molar ratio of CERC-002:soluble LIGHT in blood was 
maintained throughout the study. The concentration of CERC-002 in tissue is expected to be 10% 
to 50% of that observed in blood (4); therefore, the molar ratio of CERC 002:soluble LIGHT in 
tissue is anticipated to be at least 6.9×103:1. Given the low basal expression of membrane-bound 
LIGHT, the considerable molar excess of CERC-002 would also be anticipated to saturate membrane-bound LIGHT.  
In secondary pharmacology studies, CERC-002 did not induce antibody dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity, did not promote complement dependent cytotoxicity and did not significantly induce 
IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IL-4, or TNFα relative to unstimulated PBMCs or 
whole blood. Air-dried CERC-002 did induce IL-8 in PBMCs, but not in whole blood, and to a 
lesser extent than did IgG4 or anti CD3 or phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin positive 
controls. Wet bound CERC-002 did not induce significant levels of IL-8. Plate-bound CERC-002 
did not significantly alter PBMC viability nor induce proliferation relative to unstimulated PBMCs 
at any of the concentrations tested. 
6.3 Clinical Experience 
One study (SAR252067-TDU11937) of CERC-002 in humans has been conducted. 
SAR252067-TDU11937 was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
of the tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending, single, SC doses of CERC-002 in 
healthy subjects. Subjects were healthy adult males and females 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, 
who received a single SC doses of 40, 120, 300, 600, 900, or 1200 mg CERC-002 on Day 0 as 
determined by [CONTACT_775116]. A total of 48 subjects, 8 subjects per dose group (6 active and 2 placebo), were enrolled.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), abnormal vital signs, ECG parameters and 
laboratory values were relatively infrequent in all dose groups and there were no apparent 
dose-dependent differences among the dose groups. There were no clinically important local 
tolerability issues in any dose group. There were no clinically significant immunogenicity findings. 
CERC-002 was absorbed with the median t
max ranging from 5.0 to 8.5 days and eliminated with 
the mean terminal half-life (t 1/2) ranging from 18.[ADDRESS_1064672] observed concentration (AUC 0-tau), and AUC, respectively.

6.4 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The potential benefit of study participation is that subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute 
lung injury may not progress to ARDS after receiving treatment with CERC-002. Subjects will 
also understand that they are contributing to the scientific knowledge that may lead to expansion of the treatment options for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. No other 
benefits of participation are anticipated. 
The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to CERC-002 and 
the risks of medical evaluation, including subcutaneous administration of study treatment. 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of CERC-002 is provided 
in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). The investigator must become familiar 
with all sections of the CERC-002 IB before the start of the study.

all variable have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the 
study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. 
When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of an event(s) 
can be documented.

been read) the written subject information and received an explanation of what the study involves, included but not limited to: the objectives, potential benefits and risks, inconveniences, and the 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.[ADDRESS_1064732]’s rights and responsibilities. A copy of the informed consent and assent documentation 
(if applicable [such as a complete set of subject information sheets and fully executed signature 
[CONTACT_1787]]) must be given to the subject. This document may require translation into local language. 
Signed consent/assent forms must remain in each subject’s study file and must be available for 
verification at any time.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1682] a copy of the consent and assent (as 
applicable) form which was reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and which received favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval. A copy of the IRB/EC’s written favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval of these documents 
must be provided to the sponsor, prior to the start of the study unless it is agreed to and documented 
(abiding by [CONTACT_431188]) prior to the study start that another 
party (such as the sponsor or coordinating principal investigator) is responsible for this action. If 
the IRB/EC requires modification of the sample subject information and consent document 
provided by [CONTACT_456], the documentation supporting this requirement must be provided to the sponsor.  
16.[ADDRESS_1064733] or Ethics Committees 
A properly constituted, valid IRB/EC according to local laws and regulations must review and 
approve the protocol, the investigator’s informed consent and assent (as applicable) document, and 
related subject information and any other study materials requiring review (such as recruitment 
information) before the start of the study. 
Until written approval by [CONTACT_256456], no subject may undergo 
any study procedure solely for determining eligibility for this study. Investigational product will 
not be released until the sponsor or its designee has received written IRB/EC approval. 
Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve and provide 
documentation of favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval of any revisions to informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a subject safety issue.  
Depending on location (outside European Union [EU] or inside EU) the IRB/EC will be apprised 
of the progress of the study and of any changes made to the protocol at least yearly. This may be 
done by [CONTACT_093] (outside EU and in some cases, inside EU) or the sponsor (in some cases inside EU). These updates include information on any serious or significant AEs.  
Upon study completion, the investigator will provide the IRB/EC with final report/summary as 
required.  
16.4 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator is required to disclose any financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year 
after where the outcome of the study could be influenced by [CONTACT_10204], or other payments the investigator received from the sponsor. The following 
information is collected: any significant payments from sponsor or subsidiaries such as grant to 
fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for ongoing consulting or 
honoraria; any proprietary interest in investigational product; any significant equity interest in the sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 CFR 54 (b) (1998).

the sponsor/CRO.  
The confidentiality of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in accordance 
with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines.  
After subjects/LAR have consented and assented (as applicable) to participate in a study, the 
sponsor and/or its representatives reviews their medical records and data collected as part of the 
study. These records and data may be reviewed by [CONTACT_431191]/auditor from the 
sponsor or its representatives, national or local authorities, or the IRB/EC which gave the approval 
for the study, third parties with whom the sponsor may develop, register or market the 
investigational product. The sponsor and its representatives will take all reasonable precautions in 
accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.  
Subjects are assigned a unique identifying number; however, the initials and date of birth may also 
be collected and used to assist the sponsor to verify the accuracy of data.  
The results of the studies, containing the subjects’ unique identifying number, relevant medical 
records and possibly initials and dates of birth, will be recorded. They may be transferred to and 
used in other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the 
countries where the study is conducted. The purpose of such transfer would include supporting 
regulatory submissions, to conduct new data analyses to publish or present the study results or to 
answer questions asked by [CONTACT_1775].

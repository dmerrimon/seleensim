2 PRÉCIS   
Background:  
• EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly improved the response rate (RR) 
and survival in patients with tumors harboring EGFR- sensitizing mutations.  
• An invariable consequence of treatment with EGFR -TKIs is the development of acquired 
resistance. The most common mechanism of resistance observed in approximately 50% of 
all cases is the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M) in exon 20. 
• Osimertinib  is a third -generation EGFR -TKI designed to target the T790M mutation, 
which has shown impressive responses in both first- and second- line settings.  
• Despi[INVESTIGATOR_204932], it is almost certain that selection pressure will lead to the emergence of newer clones that are resistant to treatment with osimertinib . In fact, a newly 
identified EGFR mutation (C797S) that result s in acquired resistance to  osimertinib  has 
been reported recently.  
• The use of local ablative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681501]  
(oligoprogressive disease) on EGFR -TKI t herapy  is promising. 
• We hypothesize that f ollowing local ablative therapy to treat oligoprogressive disease after 
emergence of resistance to AZD9291, osimertinib  can be resumed safely and re- initiation 
of osimertinib  results in additional progression- free survival benefits. 
Objectives:  
• Determine the safety , tolerability,  and efficacy (as assessed by [CONTACT_16625]) of re- initiation of 
osimertinib  following local ablative therapy (LAT) for patients with oligoprogressive 
disease after treatment with osimertinib   
• Assess mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib  
Eligibility:  
• Histologically confirmed advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR- sensit izing somatic 
mutations  or a germline T790M mutation and no prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) therapy (Cohort 1); OR progressive disease after 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI therapy harboring somatic T790M mutation (Cohort 2);  or patients with progressive 
disease after treatment with osimertinib who are eligible for local ablative therapy  
(Cohort 3).  If biopsy for EGFR mutation status  confirmation is not clinically feasible, 
EGFR mutation s may be confirmed by [CONTACT_681548] a CLIA certified assay.  
• Presence of measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1  
• ECOG performance status 0 -2 
• Adequate end organ function 
• If patients are not eligible for LAT, they will be referred for standard of care chemotherapy as per treating physicians’ discretion. These patients may also be considered for other 
clinical trials.  
Design:  
• This is a single -institution, open- label phase II trial of osimertinib .  
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
3 • Eligible patient s not previously treated with osimertinib  will be treated with osimertinib  
daily until disease progression. At the time of progression, patients with oligoprogressive 
disease (no more than 5 sites of progressive disease) will be assessed for LAT .  
• If patients are eligible for LAT , osimertinib  will be resumed after LAT and they wi ll be 
followed for second progression on osimertinib  (PFS2).  
• If patients progress at the same site where LAT has been performed before,  the progression 
will be considered to be a result of inadequate ablation and they will be considered for 
repeat LAT and  again re -challenged with osimertinib  if clinically feasible.   
• Tumor samples will be obtained at baseline by a mandatory biopsy. At the time of first progression on osimertinib  if a patient is eligible for surgery as a form of LAT, then a tissue 
sample will be obtained for genomic and proteomic studies to identify mechanisms of 
acquired resistance. For patients who are not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that is not surgery (ra diation, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), then a mandatory biopsy will be 
performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for above studies. 
• Re-treatment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.

Eligibility for local ablative the rapy (LAT)  is based on the following criteria:  
a. Oligoprogressive disease – no more than 5 sites of progressive disease that are 
amenable to treatment with LAT (surgery, radiation therapy , radiofrequency 
ablation , or cryoablation ) independent of size and location of lesions.  
b. Patients with neurological or imaging signs of leptomeningeal disease and/or 
confirmed by a lumbar puncture occurring after initiation of osimertinib will be considered for LAT if radiation or intrathecal meth otrexate can be administered for 
local treatment.

ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 NSCLC  
Overview of NSCLC  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide. 159,260 patients died of lung cancer in the [LOCATION_002] in 2014, making up 27% of all cancer deaths
(1). The 5 -year survival rate for lung cancer (17%) is lower than most of other 
common solid tumors, such as colon cancer (65%) and breast cancer (89%)(1). Non- small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, comprising 86% of all lung cancer cases
(2). Of these patients, more than 55% will present with advanced disease(1), which is not 
amenable to curative treatment.  
Platinum- based doublet chemotherapy regimens are the standard of care for patients with advanced 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 8 NSCLC and good perf ormance status(3), who do not have targetable driver mutations. The 
treatment with platinum- based doublet chemotherapy is unsatisfactory, with objective response 
rates generally in the range of 20 -30%(4, 5), and the median  survival in the range of approximately 
10-12 months(6). Adding a third chemotherapy drug to the platinum -doublet has not improved 
overall survival(7). Non-platinum- based regimens have been evaluated in several trials, but 
objective response rates were lower compared to platinum -containing regimens(8), and 
progression- free survival (PFS) was inferior(9). 
Targeted therapy for advanced NSCLC 
In the past decade, insights into the genetic and molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer have led to 
the development of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Erlotinib is an orally active reversible epi[INVESTIGATOR_147779] (EGFR -TKI), which has demonstrated marked clinical 
efficacy over standard chemotherapy in EGFR mutation -positive advanced NSCLC
(10). EGFR  
mutations are the most frequent genetic abnormalities observed in NSCLC, especially in adenocarcinoma subtype
(11). The most predominant EGFR mutations are in -frame deletions in 
exon 19 and L858R missense mutation(11), and the majority of patients whose tumor  harbors  these 
mutations are highly sensitive to EGFR -TKIs. Several randomized trials, which compared erlotinib 
with standard chemotherapy as first -line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR mutation -
positive NSCLC, demonstrated objective response rates of 58- 83% for erlotinib, and 15- 36% for 
chemotherapy(4, 5). The median PFS  was also significantly longer in erlotinib -treated patients (9.7 -
13.1 months) than in those treated with chemotherapy (4.6- 5.2 months). Erlotinib received 
approval for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic  NSCLC after failure of 
one or two chemotherapy regimens by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004(12). 
In 2013, the indication for erlotinib was  expanded to include first -line treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC harboring EGFR  mutations(13). Erlotinib is well tolerated with most adverse events being 
grade 1 or 2(14, 15). The most common side effects of erlotinib are skin rash, diarrhea, and fatigue, 
which were primarily grade 1 or 2 in severity(4).  
Gefitinib is another first- generation orally administered E GFR -TKI. Randomized trials that 
compared gefitinib with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations in the first- line setting showed objective response rates of 62- 74% for gefitinib, and 31 -
32% for chemotherapy
(16, 17). Patients who were treated with gefitinib  had a prolonged 
progression- free survival (9.2- 10.8 months), as compared with those who were treated with 
standard chemotherapy (5.4- 6.3 months). Like erlotinib, most adverse events associated with 
gefitinib were grade [ADDRESS_922887] -line 
treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation -positive NSCLC in 2015(18). 
Afatinib is a selective, irreversible, orally bioavailable second -generation  EGFR -TKI that was 
approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2013(19). In a phase III study of 345 pa tients with metastatic NSCLC 
harboring EGFR mutations, 230 and 115 were randomized to afatinib and cisplatin/pemetrexed, 
respectively(20). The median PFS was 11.1 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy 
(hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI=0.43 to 0.78; p=0.001). In patients whose tumors carry exon 19 deletions or L858R, the median PFS was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy. In a pooled analy sis of two randomized trials (LUX -Lung 3 and LUX -Lung 6), 
afatinib was shown to improve overall survival in patients whose tumors harbor exon 19 deletions
(21). The most frequent adverse events from afatinib were diarrhea, rash/acne, stomatitis, 
and decreased appetite(20).

 9 Resistance to EGFR -TKI 
Resistance to single- agent targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681503](22), 
and it poses a major challenge to the treating physician. Although first and second- generation 
EGFR -TKIs produce remarkable clinical responses, 5- 10% of pat ients with EGFR mutation -
positive NSCLC are refractory to EGFR -TKIs, and up to 40% of patients harboring EGFR  
sensitizing mutations do not attain a major response to the first- generation EGFR -TKIs (erlotinib 
and gefitinib)(4, 5, 16, 17), indi cating the existence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Moreover, 
even those who achieved an objective response invariably develop acquired resistance. Largely, 
resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy involve alterations in the gene that encodes the tar get 
of targeted agent and activation of alternative signaling  pathways(23). KRAS  mutation, Cripto1 
overexpression, MET  gene amplification, and HGF overexpression have been implicated in the 
molecular pathogenesis of intrinsic resistance to EGFR -TKIs(24-26). Known acquired mechanisms 
of resistance to EGFR -TKIs i nclude EGFR  T790M mutation (50- 60%), and less frequently MET  
gene amplification, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression, mutations in the PIK3CA  
gene, epi[INVESTIGATOR_494514], and small cell lung cancer transformation(25, 27-31). 
  Osimertinib  
Non-clinical studies of Osimertinib  
Osimertinib is an irreversible, potent, and selective third- generation EGFR -TKI that targets both 
sensitizing and T790M EGFR mutations(32). In EGFR  recombinant enzyme assays (Millipore ), 
osimertinib  had approximately [ADDRESS_922888] L858R/T790M than wild- type 
EGFR, suggesting its wide selectivity margin. Compared to both first (erlotinib and gefitinib) and second generation (afatinib and dacomitinib) EGFR -TKIs, osimertinib  demonstrat ed comparable 
potency in inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation in EGFR cell lines harboring activating EGFR  
mutations (PC -9, H3255, H1650). Importantly, osimertinib  was much more potent in inhibiting 
EGFR phosphorylation in EGFR cell lines (H1975, PC -9VanR) carr ying T790M mutation with 
mean IC
50 less than 15 nmol/L. 
Osimertinib  showed dose -dependent tumor regression in both PC -9 (ex19del) and H1975 
(L858R/T790M) tumor xenograft models(32). In both models, tumor shrinkage was observed at 
doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg/day after 14- day treatment. The response to  osimertinib  was shown to 
be durable in tumor xenograft models. In PC -9 xenografts, there was a complete response 
following 40 daily doses of 5 mg/kg/day osimertinib , which lasted more than 200 days. By 
[CONTACT_2163], gefitinib at 6.25 mg/kg/day resulted in less tumor regression, and tumors began to regrow after nearly 90 days in the same xenograft model. The activity  of osimertinib  was further 
examined in in vivo  transgenic mouse models. Tumors harboring EGFR
L858R were sensitive to 
afatinib and osimertinib , but tumors car rying EGFRL858R+T790M were only sensitive to osimertinib . 
Osimertinib  is metabolized into at least two metabolite species, AZD5104 and AZ7550(32). 
Biochemical assays showed that AZD7550 had a similar potency and selectivity profile to osimertinib , whereas AZD5104 exhibited significantly greater potency than osimertinib  across 
mutant and wild -type EGFR assays, and thus displayed a smaller margin of selectivity against 
wild-type EGFR compared to EGFRm/T790M and EGFRm in vitro. O simertinib  has good 
bioavailability, and wide tissue distribution. When tumor tissues from H1975 xenografts were harvested 1, 6, 16, 24, and 30 hours after a single dose of osimertinib  (5mg/kg), both phospho-
EGFR and downstream signaling pathway were inhibited after [ADDRESS_922889] that 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 10 osimertinib  is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR. O simertinib  was well tolerated in the animals. 
There was minimal weight loss, which was defined as less than 5% loss of baseline body weight, 
even after administration for 200 days. 
Clinical studies of osimertinib   
The mesylate salt of osimertinib  has been evaluated in a phase I dose -escalation clinical trial in 
patients with advanced EFGR- mutant NSCLC who progressed after treatment with EGFR -
TKI(33). The study included dose -escalation and dose expansion cohorts. Patients in the dose -
escalation cohort received a single oral dose of osimertinib , which was followed by a period of 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. After [ADDRESS_922890] dose level was 20 mg daily. If there was evidence of clinical activity in a dose -escalation group, a dose -expansion cohort could 
be opened. In the dose-escalation cohort, daily dosing of osimertinib  was initiated immediately.  
A total of 253 patients from 33 sites were enrolled in the study(33). [ADDRESS_922891] notably at the 160 mg and 240 mg dose levels. There were 6 cases of potential pneumonitis -like events. All 6 patients discontinued osimertinib  at the 
time of the event, and received steroid treatment with subsequent resolution or improvement of symptoms. There were 6 patients who developed hyperglycemia, and 11 patients who had prolongation of QTc (corrected QT) interval; none of these events led to discontinuation or reduction of osimertinib . Fatal adverse events were observed in 7 patients, and  it was reported that 
one case (pneumonia) was possibly drug -related. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that 
osimertinib  had a median time to reach th e maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of 6 hours, 
and a mean half -life of 55 hours. Based on this information, it was estimated that steady -state 
concentrations would be reached within 22 days of daily dosing. 
Among 239 evaluable patients, 123 (51%) had a confirmed complete response (1 patient) or partial response (122 patients)
(33). 78 (33%) had stable disease, 34 (14%) had progressive disease, and 4 
(2%) were unevaluable for response. The response rate was comparable at each dose level. EGFR  
T790M was detected in tumors from 138 of the 222 patients (62%). Of the 138 patients, 127 patients were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was seen in 78 of the 127 patients 
(61%) in patients with EGFR T790M. The objective response rate in patients without EGFR 
T790M was 21% (13 of the 61 patients). Of the 105 patients in the dose -expansion cohorts who 
had a confirmed response, 85% had responses lasting equal to or longer than 6 months, and the median progression free survival was 8.2 months (9.6 months in EGFR T790M- positive patients, 
2.8 months in EGFR T790M -negative patients). Based on the safety and efficacy data from the 
phase I study, the recommended first dose level of osimertinib  for phase II and III studies 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was [ADDRESS_922892] progressed on or after EGFR- TKI therapy(34). 
The preliminary data of osimertinib  as first -line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC with 
EGFR mutations who were naïve to EGFR -TKI treatment were presented at the 51th annual 
meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)(35). In this trial, a total of 60 
patients were treated with osimertinib  at doses of 80 mg daily (n=30) and 160 mg daily (n=30). At 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/[ADDRESS_922893] common adverse events were rash, 
diarrhea, dry skin, stomatitis, paronychia, decreased appetite, and fatigue. The incidences of hyperglycemia, QT prolongation, and int erstitial lung disease (ILD) -like events were 5%, 7%, and 
5%, respectively. Dose reduction due to adverse events occurred in 10% of patients treated with 80 mg daily and 43% of those treated with 160 mg daily. 3 (10%) patients treated with 80 mg daily and 1 (3%) patient treated with 160 mg daily discontinued osimertinib  due to adverse events. The 
objective response rate in patients treated with 80 mg daily was 63% with all responses being partial response. In the group receiving 160 mg daily, 83% had objective responses with 1 (3%) complete response and 24 (80%) partial responses. The percentages of patients remaining progression- free at 9 months were 83% in patients receiving 80 mg daily and 78% in those 
receiving 160 mg daily. 
It has been shown that osimertinib has excellent  penetration of the mouse blood- brain barrier 
compared to other EGFR -TKIs including gefitinib, rociletinib, or afatinib
(36). Osimertinib also 
showed activity against brain metastases from EGFR- mutated NSCLC in early clinical reports(36). 
At the 2016 ASCO annual meeting, results from a phase I study of osimertinib for patients with 
leptomeningeal disease ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) were presented(37). Patients were eligible if they had 
progressed on prior EGFR -TKI therapy and leptomeningeal disease is confirmed by [CONTACT_681550][INVESTIGATOR_184590]. Patients were treated with osimertinib 160 mg once daily. Of 12 
patients who were treated >[ADDRESS_922894] common treatment- associated 
side effects were skin rash (n=15; 11 grade 1, 4 grade 2) and diarrhea (n=8; 5 grade 1, and 3 grade 
2). In one patient, grade [ADDRESS_922895] -line EGFR -TKI 
targeted therapy
(38). For patients who have disease progression based on the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and yet remain asymptomatic, the use o f erlotinib beyond 
progression was associated with a delay in initiation of chemotherapy(39) and thus constitutes a 
reasonable option. Another line of evidence supporting this approach derives from previous observations that some patients experience a disease flare leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681504]
(40). 
In general, outside clinical trials, systemic chemotherapy is recommended for patients who have symptomatic disease progression, especially if there are multiple progressive lesions
(41, 42). 
However, treatment outcomes associated with second- line chemotherapy are modest; the median 
PFS after second -line chemotherapy for patients who progressed on EGFR -TKI therapy is only 4 -
5 months(41, 43, 44). Continuation of EGFR -TKI therapy beyond progression in addition to 
commencement of chemotherapy has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. A randomized phase II study that compared chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) with chemotherapy plus erlotinib in patients with progressive NSCLC following prior benefit from erlotinib demonstrated that continuation of erlotinib was associated with a significant increase in toxicities, but not with improvement in treatment outcomes
(43). In a phase III trial of [ADDRESS_922896] -line gefitinib, addition of gefitinib to platinum- based doublet 
chemotherapy did not prolong PFS(41). The use of afatinib beyond progression was evaluated in a 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 12 phase III study that involved 202 patients who progressed on erlotinib/gefitinib and afatinib(44).  
Study participants were randomized 2:1 to afatinib plus paclitaxel or single -agent chemotherapy 
of investigator’s choice. Although preliminary data showed that there was a significant 
improvement in PFS favoring continuation of afatinib (median 5.[ADDRESS_922897] ratio=0.60, p=0.003), study data are not mature yet. For patients who developed the EGFR T790M mutation after first- line EGFR -TKI, osimertinib  is a treatment option. However, about half of 
patients with acquired resistance to first- or second -generation EGFR -TKI would not benefit from 
osimertinib . Moreover, it is almost certain that selection pressure will lead to the emergence of 
newer clones that are resistant to treatment with osimertinib . In fact, a newly identified EGFR 
mutation (C797S) that results in acquired resistance to osimertinib  has been reported recently
(45). 
Because targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681505], patients would benefit from continuation of a TKI and delay in initiation of subsequent therapy such as chemotherapy. Therefore various strategies 
need to be evaluated to delay a switch in systemic therapy due to emergence of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy. In this regard, exploring the role of local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681506] -TKI therapy merits further investigation. There are 
several theoretical benefits of using local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681507]. First, local progression is the predominant pattern of failure for patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first- line 
systemic therapy
(46); among patients seen at the University of Colorado between [ADDRESS_922898] site of extracranial progression was local only in 64% of pa tients
(47). Second, the Norton- Simon hypothesis suggests that the effect of 
systemic therapy is proportional to the rate of tumor growth at the time of treatment and tumor  
growth follows a sigmoidal pattern(48, 49). Local ablative therapy may move the tumor growth 
curve back to a state of exponential growth and thereby [CONTACT_681551]
(46). Third, local therapy may serve as a means of eliminating an evolutionary reservoir of 
resistant subclones(50) and thus help extend the use of targeted therapy. 
While local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_94898], stereotactic radiation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation have been shown to be effective for several types of cancer including colorectal cancer, sarcoma, 
and renal cell carcinoma in the metastatic disease setting
(51), the role of local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681508]
(52-
55). Findings from these studies, however, indicate that there might be a subset of patients who 
benefit from aggressive local therapy (Table 1). The the rapeutic utility of combining local ablative 
therapy and targeted therapy for the treatment of oligometastatic NSCLC was recently examined. In a single -arm phase II study, 24 patients with metastatic NSCLC and no more than 6 sites of 
extracranial disease w ho progressed through previous platinum- based chemotherapy were treated 
with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with erlotinib
(56). Of the [ADDRESS_922899] documented progression on erlotinib or 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 13 gefitinib , 18 patients were treated wi th one or more local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], excluding intracranial 
treatments, for progressive EGFR mutation -positive NSCLCs(57). The most common site of 
metastatic disease was lung, followed by [CONTACT_106819], bone, and brain in the local therapy group, 
and all patients except one patient had oligometastatic disease, defined as less than 5 sites of disease. Local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681509]  (lobectomy, wedge resection, 
pneumonectomy, adrenalectomy), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and stereotactic radiotherapy. Most local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681510], with 85% of patients restarting EG FR-TKI therapy within 
1 month of local therapy. The median time to progression after local therapy was 10 months (range 1 to 51 months), and the median time from local therapy until a change in systemic therapy was 22 months (range 1 to 54 months). The median overall survival from local therapy was 41 months (range 1 to >65 months). Another single -center study that assessed the benefits of the combination 
of local therapy and continued TKI therapy (crizotinib or erlotinib) in patients with oligoprogressive disease, defined as nonleptomeningeal CNS and/or 4 or fewer of extracranial 
progression
(58). 15 of 28 patients (54%) treated with crizotinib and 10 of 23 patients (43%) treated 
with erlotinib were deemed suitable for local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681511]. Among the [ADDRESS_922900] progressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and [ADDRESS_922901] common sites being lung and bone. Patients with less than four CNS metastases received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and those with more than four CNS metastatic lesions were treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Most of the 15 patients who had extracranial disease progression received SBRT, with 8 of 15 (53%) having a single site of progression ablated. One patient underwent adrenalectomy. The subsequent median pr ogression- free survival from the time of first 
progression (PFS2) was 7.1 months for patients with initial CNS only progression. The median PFS2 for patients with initial extracranial progression was 4.0 months. The majority of adverse events in this case -series occurred in patients who received WBRT. Grade 1/[ADDRESS_922902]- line treatment  setting is that it not only inhibits the 
exon 19 deletion and L858R mutants, but also the T790M mutant. In addition, osimertinib  appears 
overall to be better tolerated than other approved EGFR- TKIs.

 Rational e  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 
This is a single -institution , open- label phase II trial. This study aims to assess the role of local 
ablative therapy in the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation -positive NSCLC after 
oligoprogression on osimertinib .  Oligoprogression is defined as no more than 5 sites of 
progressive disease that are amenable to treatment with LAT (surgery, radiation therapy , 
radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation ) independent of size and location of lesions. There is no 
FDA -approved treatment for patients who progressed on osimertinib  and thus assessing the 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 16 efficacy of local ablative therapy as a strategy to extend the benefits of osimertinib  merits further 
investigation.  
In the phase 1 dose escalation study of osimertinib  (D5160C00001, AURA), once daily doses of 
20, 40, 80, 160, and 240  mg of osimertinib  were evaluated. Based on the totality of the safety, 
pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data, 80 mg once daily was selected as the 
recommended phase II dose. In light of these data, the startin g dose of osimertinib will be 80 mg 
per day for patients without leptomeningeal disease. For patients with leptomeningeal disease, the start dose of osimertinib will be 160 mg per day based on the results of the BLOOM trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Patients may continue to receive osimertinib  as long as they are continuing to 
show clinical benefit, as judged by [CONTACT_737], and in the absence of discontinuation criteria.  
No dosage adjustment is required due to patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity and smoking status.  
Patients who progress on their initial treatment with osimertinib  and receive LAT therapy ( surgery , 
radiation therapy, or RFA) followed by [CONTACT_681552] (PFS2). The objective will be to estimate the PFS2 for these patients and also to determine if the PFS2 result may be potentially  superior to that of historic controls. Response and 
progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) version 1.1
(67). 
Another important goal of this study is to assess mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib . 
Tumor samples will be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and upon development of acquired resistance. Whole exome, transcriptome  and/or whole genome sequencing and proteomics 
analyses will be performed on  the tumor samples. In addition, this protocol will involve 
longitudinal acquisition of  liquid biopsies (blood, saliva, urine), which will be used for 
comprehensive proteogenomic analysis. Germline DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood and the infor mation will only be used for the identification of somatic variants. Leftover biological 
samples will be frozen and stored in [CONTACT_62583]’s lab.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION 
3.1 S
TUDY DESIGN  
This is a single -institution, open- label phase II trial. Patients with EGFR mutation -positive NSCLC  
who are treatment -naïve (cohort 1) or who progressed on first - or second- generation EGFR -TKIs 
– erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib – and acquired the T790M muta tion (cohort 2)  will be included in 
the study and treated with osimertinib .  These groups of patients will be followed for progression-
free survival (PFS1).  At the time of progression, their candidacy for local ablative therapy will be 
assessed at a multi disciplinary conference.  Eligibility for local ablative therapy (LAT) is based on 
the following criteria:  
1. Oligoprogressive disease – no more than 5 sites of progressive disease that are amenable 
to treatment with LAT (surgery, radiation therapy , radiofre quency ablation, or 
cryoablation ) independent of size and location of lesions. 
2. Patients with neurological or imaging signs of leptomeningeal disease and/or confirmed by 
a lumbar puncture occurring after initiation of osimertinib will be considered for LAT if radiation or intrathecal methotrexate can be administered for local treatment.   In these 
cases, following LAT, osimertinib will be increased to 160 mg dose. The dose of osimertinib for leptomeningeal disease treatment under this proto col is 160 mg of 
osimertinib. Osimertinib has superior penetration of the blood brain barrier and the 160 mg 
dose has been used extensively in clinical studies with minimal side effects.    
If patients are eligible for local ablative therapy, osimertinib  will be resumed at the discretion of 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_681514].  They will be followed for second progression on 
osimertinib  (PFS2). If patients are not eligible for local ablative therapy, they will be referred for 
standard of care chemotherapy as per treating physicians’ discretion. These patients may also be considered for other clinical trials.

 23 Those who were treated with osimertinib  in other institutions in on -going clinical trials and 
developed acquired resistance (cohort 3)  will also be assessed for their candidacy for local ablative 
therapy and may be enrolled onto the study if they are eligible for local ablative therapy.  These 
patients will only be part of the LAT and re- challenge with osimertinib part of the study.  
Tumor samples will be obtained at baseline by a mandatory biopsy  unless fresh tissue was 
collected at screening . At the time of first progression on osimertinib  if a patient is eligible for 
surgery as a form of LAT, then tissue sample will be obtained for all correlative studies. For 
patients who are not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that is not surgery (radiation, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), then a mandatory biopsy will be performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for correlative studies. If a biopsy at  this time is  not clinically safe , then tissue 
obtained from the previous biopsy for mutation testing needed for eligibility for this protocol may be used. At the time o f second progression on osimertinib , a fresh tumor biopsy is optional.

Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
If a patient experiences a CTCAE grade 3 or higher and/or unacceptable toxicity (any grade), where the clinician considers the event of concern to be specifically associated with osimertinib  
(and not attributable to the disease or disease- related processes for which patient is being treated), 
dosing will be interrupted and supportive therapy admini stered as required in accordance with 
local practice/guidelines. Once a patient has a dose reduction due to toxicity, the dose will not be re-escalated.  Only one dose reduction will be allowed per patient  except for patients  with 
leptomeningeal disease at  baseline who started osimertinib at 160 mg per day  (two dose reductions 
are allowed in those with leptomeningeal disease at baseline) . Occurrence of an event requiring 
dose reduction at the 40 mg dose will result in removal from study therapy. 
If the toxi city resolves or reverts to ≤CTCAE grade 2 within 4 weeks of onset, treatment with 
osimertinib  may be restarted at the same dose or a lower dose using the rules below for dose 
modifications ( Table 3). There will be no individual modifications to dosing schedule in response

[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary Symptoms 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., dyspnea) or radiological abnormality suggestive 
of interstitial lung disease is observed, an interruption in osimertinib  dosing is recommended. It is 
strongly recommended to perform a full diagnostic workup, to exclude alternative causes such as lymphangitic carcinomatosis, infection, allergy, cardiogenic edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage.  
In the presence of confirmatory HRCT scans where other causes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_591254], a diagnosis of ILD should be considered and study drug should be per manently 
discontinued. Where ILD is suspected, administer corticosteroids  at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day

3.5 ON STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Tumor samples will be obtained at baseline by a biopsy unless fresh tissue is available at screening . 
Patients will be seen on Days - 1 and 7 (±2 days) of cycle 1, and on D ay -1 of each subsequent 
treatment cycle . On study assessments can be performed within ±5 days of the specified time point, 
unless ot herwise indicated.  The following will be done: 
• History and physical exam  
• Laboratory evaluation: Hematologic and biochemical profile as listed in section 2.3 
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_217588] (cytology, cell counts, and protein and glucose levels) will be 
performed only in patients with suspected leptomeningeal disease.

sample will be obtained. For patients who are not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that is not surgery (RT, RFA, cryoablation), then a mandatory biopsy will be performed, if clinically safe.  
 
Note  1: If patients progress on osimertinib  and are eligible for LAT, appropri ate testing such as 
pulmonary function tests and a whole- body FDG -PET scan will be performed.  
Note 2: If patients progress at the same site where LAT has been performed before, the progression 
will be considered to be a result of inadequate ablation and t hey will be considered for repeat LAT 
and again re -challenged with osimertinib  if clinically feasible.  Re-initiation of osimertinib  
treatment in this case also has to be within a month.   Note 3:  Every attempt will be made to collect  urine and saliva sample s at each protocol specified 
timepoint. Collection of  the urine and saliva  samples  is to be strongly pursued but is not required 
and may be waived at the discretion of the PI .  
Before re- initiation of osimertinib  following LAT, the followi ng will be done. 
• History and physical exam  
• Laboratory evaluation  
o Hematological Profile: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet 
count, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

Version Date :  12/26/[ADDRESS_922928] will evaluate the feasibility of saf ely treating the site(s) of progressive disease, for which he/she may require a 
CT simulation/planning session. He/she may determine at any time during the consult/simulation/planning process that radiation therapy is not feasible.  
Each site of progressive disease should be treated to a definitive dose. Brain metastases may be treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or the combination of WBRT + SRS. Sites of extracranial disease may be treated with conventionally  
fractionated external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)/stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).  The specific dose and fractionation scheme  
is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.   If multiple sites are to be treated with 
radiation therapy, they may be treated either concurrently or sequentially at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.   
As of Amendment J, patients may receive radiation therapy  concurrently with osimertinib . The 
type and amount of radiation therapy to be administered will be determined by [CONTACT_681563].  In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_681516], if any site cannot be safely treated to a 
definitive dose for any reason, patient will be considered not to be eligible for radiation as a 
form of LAT . Palliative radiation may still be given if clinically indicated.  Patients will not be 
eligible for LAT in such cases.  
Each patient must be specifically con sented for unknown side effects and/or toxicities, either

 Criteria for removal from protocol therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue until one of 
the following criteria applies: 
• Disease progression , per RECIST*, 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  as described in section 3.4, 
• Delay of treatment of ≥ 4 weeks,  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  therapy  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
• Severe non-compliance with the study protocol  
Note: *Some subjects may be eligible for re -treatment if removed for this reason.  See Section 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/[ADDRESS_922930] that decides to discontinue investigational will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse events.  If possible, they will be seen and ass essed by [CONTACT_39595](s).  Adverse events will be followed up for 
minimum of [ADDRESS_922931].

OLLOW UP 
Patients will be followed either with clinic visits or phone interviews yearly until death .  Patients 
removed from treatment  for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed  clinically until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event, and then via clinic visits or phone interviews yearly until death . 
The following information will be collected:  
• Date of follow up 
• Is patient dead or alive?  
• If dead, document exact date of death.  
• Further treatment(s) , if any  
• Document date of disease progression  
3.10 O
FF STUDY CRITERIA  
At any time, patients are free to discontinue treatment and withdraw from the study (i.e., study treatment and assessments). A patient who decides to discontinue treatment and assessments will always be asked about th e reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be 
seen and assessed by [CONTACT_39595]. Adverse events will be followed up; all investigational product should be returned by [CONTACT_681564]. The term withdrawal from the study 
refers to both the discontinuation from the t reatment and study assessments.  Withdrawn subjects 
will not be replaced.  
Once a patient has been removed from study, no further data can be collected; therefore, with 
completion of the duration of follow -up described in Section 3.9, the criteria for removal from 
study are:  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Death  
• The patient decides to withdraw from the study. 
• Investigator di scretion  
The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the database.

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS/MEASURES  
4.[ADDRESS_922933] try to avoid concomitant use of medications, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods with known potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 whenever feasible; however,  patients may receive any medication that is clinically indicated for treatment 
of adverse events. Such drugs must have been discontinued for an appropriate period before they enter screening and for a period of [ADDRESS_922934] dose of osimertinib . All 
concomitant medications should be captured on the CRF.  Guidance on medicines to avoid, medications that require close monitoring and on washout periods is provided (see Appendix 
B). 
If medically feasible, patients taking regular medication, with the exception of potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (see above), should be maintained on it throughout the study period. Patients taking concomitant medications whose disposition are dependent upon CYP3A4, and BCRP  and which have a narrow therapeutic index should be closely monitored for signs of 
changed tolerability as a result of increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving osimertinib . Additionally, due to the potential CYP450 and p- glycoprotein induction 
risk exposure of drug that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP1A2 or CYP2C or whose deposition is mediated by p -glycoprotein could also be reduced and should also be monitored 
for reduction in therapeutic activity (especially those which have narrow therapeutic index).  
Guidance on medications to avoid, medications that require close monitoring and on washout 
periods should be provided. 
Patients should be advised of the potential reduction in effectiveness of oral hormona l 
contraceptives (due to CYP3A4 induction) when used with osimertinib . A change to a non -oral 
method of contraception (e.g. IUS Levonorgestrel Intra Uterine System, Medroxyprogesterone 
injections), or addition of a barrier method (e.g. condoms, diaphragm) to the primary hormonal method, is recommended prior to the commencement of treatment. 
Up to 1.5- fold increase in exposure may occur in statin exposure when co administered with 
osimertinib . It is recommended that the starting and maintenance dose of statins should be as 
low as possible and should be guided by [CONTACT_681565]. Monitoring of low - density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol levels is advised. If the patient experiences any potentially relevant adverse 
events suggestive of muscle toxicity including unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or 
weakness, particularly if accompanied by [CONTACT_21936], the statin should be stopped, creatine kinase (CK) levels should be checked, and any appropriate further management should be taken. 
Patients taking warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR.

Version Date :  12/26/[ADDRESS_922935]’s safety and well -being, may be given at the discretion of t he Investigator and recorded 
in the appropriate sections of the Case Report Form. 
 Supportive care guidelines  
• Nausea/vomiting may be treated with anti- emetics.  
• Diarrhea  should be managed with loperamide:  [ADDRESS_922936] onset, then 2 mg every 
2-4 hours until diarrhea is controlled (maximum = 16 mg loperamide per day).  
• Hand- foot syndrome may be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669] (such as Aquaphor), 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/systemic steroids,  and/or antihistamine agents.  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; 50 -
150 mg orally each day) may also be used.  Avoid exposure to heat, hot water, pressure, or friction. Use of soft, well -fitting shoes may help, as may use of 
acetaminophen if needed for analgesia.  
• Patients with neutropenic fever or infection should be evaluated promptly and 
treated with IV antibiotic therapy or therapeutic colony -stimulating factors as 
appropriate following the ASCO guidelines .
(68) Packed  red blood cell and platelet 
transfusion should be administered as clinically indicated.  Erythropoietic agents may be us ed at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 Additional Restrictions  
If medically feasible, patients taking regular medication, with the exception of potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (see above), should be maintained on it throughout the access program period ([ADDRESS_922937] dose). Patients taking concomitant medications whose disposition is 
dependent upon CYP3A4  and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and which have a narrow 
therapeutic index should be closely monitored for signs of change d tolerability as a result of 
increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving osimertinib .  Patients taking 
concomitant medications whose disposition is dependent upon CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C or p-glycoprotein and which have a narrow therapeutic index should be closely monitored for 
reduction in therapeutic activity as a result of the reduced exposure of the concomitant medication while receiving osimertinib . Guidance on medications to avoid, medications that 
require close monitoring and on washout periods is provided (see Appendix B ). 
Up to 1.5- fold increase in exposure may occur in statin exposure when co -administered with 
osimertinib . It is recommended that the starting and maintenance dose of statins should be as 
low as possible and should be guided by [CONTACT_681566].  
Patients taking warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or 
international normalized ratio (INR).

5.1 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH /PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES  
 Pathology correlative studies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing  
Tumor samples will be obtained at the following times.  
• At baseline prior to initiation of the study treatment 
• At the time of first progression on osimertinib   
• At the time of second progression on osimertinib , a fresh tumor biopsy is optional. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tissue sampling and handling  
An excision biopsy of accessible lymph node or cutaneous nodule, or CT or bronchosco py 
guided core needle biopsy using a 16- [ADDRESS_922939] progression on osimertinib , if a patient is eligible for surgery as a form of LAT, then 
tumor sample will be obtained for all correlative studies. For patients who are not eligible for 
LAT or a form of LAT that is not surgery (radiation, radiofrequency ablation), then a mandatory biopsy will be performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for correlative studies.   If a biopsy 
at this time is not clinically safe, then tissue obtained from the previous biopsy for the mutation testing needed for eligibility for this protocol may be used.  
Material released for research st udies will be documented on form NIH 2803- [ADDRESS_922940] & 
Certification for Research Procurement of Human Biological Materials. Initial processing of samples for research will depend on the size of the tumor biopsy. For core biopsies the research sample will t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_681518] [ADDRESS_922941] core will be processed and stored in the 
NCI Laboratory of Pathology.  
The second core (when successfully obtained without additional risk to the patient) will be snap 
frozen in a microcentrifuge vial in liquid nitrogen. The third core will be frozen in an OCT block 
in Liquid Nitrogen. The investigators may decide to use either the 3
rd or 4th core to generate a 
cell line or patient -derived xenograft (PDX).  These research samples will be stored in [CONTACT_62583]’s 
laboratory (10/3B52) at -80°C on site.   
Tumor may be viably frozen, typi[INVESTIGATOR_151166] 20-100x106/mL in FB S with 10% 
DMSO using a temperature controlled freezing process to optimize sample viability. Samples 
will be transferred to liquid Nitrogen tanks for long- term storage.

[IP_ADDRESS] Studies 
[CONTACT_681625]’s group at UCLA has developed a method of detecting EGFR mutations in body fluids using a technology that is based on electric field- induced release and measurement 
(EFIRM). This uses a multiplexible electrochemical sensor that can detect EGFR mutations in bodily fluids
(74, 75). EFIRM -liquid biopsy (eLB) showed near 100% concordance with biopsy -
based genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_681529]- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) lung 
cancer patients  in two independent blinded clinical studies in Taiwan(75) and China (preliminary 
data).  In collaboration with [CONTACT_681625] and his group at UCLA, we will detect EGFR 
mutations from serial saliva collection fro m patients and correlate the findings with the mutation

96-well electrochemical plate (E Plate 96), manufactured by [CONTACT_681586]. (San Diego 
CA) under GMP. To avoid imprecision due to human operation, all the liquid handling 
procedures will be done with the BioMek 3000 robotic system and BioRad platewasher. The detection device is a 96 -channel electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical signals for all 
channels  on the electrochemical plate are analyzed simultaneously, in real -time.

All research specimens will be coded.  
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described below. The study will remain open so long as sample or data analysis continues.  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed.

 Laboratory of Pathology 
Tissues designated for clinical diagnostics are transported to the Laboratory of Pathology (LP) where they are examined grossly and relevant portions are fixed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned and stained for diagnostic interpretation.  Unutilized excess tissue that is not placed 
in paraffin blocks  is stored in formalin for up to three months, in accordance with College of 
American Pathologists/Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (CAP/JCAHO) guidelines, and then discarded.   Following completion of the diagnostic 
workup, the slides and tissue blocks are stored indef initely in the LP’s clinical archives.   All 
specimens are catalogued and retrieved utilizing the clinical laboratory information systems, in accordance with CAP/JCAHO regulations.   The use of any stored specimens for research 
purposes is only allowed when the appropriate IRB approval has been obtained.  In some cases,

 Laboratory of Jane Trepel  
Samples will be processed immediately by [CONTACT_271618].  Biospecimens will be 
collected and processed using validated SOPs that will ensure both specimen quality and patient confidentiality. Using a computerized inventory system and a backup hardcopy process, all specimen collection and processing steps will be documented and the specific location of each specimen will be tracked. Each new specimen collected will be assigned a unique barcode identifier that can be linked to the original specimen collected and other relevant information within the inventory system.  Specimen labels will indicate: protocol number, order in which the patient enrolled on the trial, type of sample, collection time, and total volume collected, as appropriate.  The inventory process contains other security provisions sufficient to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality. Access to the inventory system and associated documents 
will be restricted to appropriate individuals. Requests to use specimens stored in the repository must be approved. SOPs ensure that any changes in informed consent made by a patient and relayed to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_90303]. All laboratory personnel will be trained to adhere to SOPs and will be monitored for high -quality performance.

LINICAL  PHARMACOLOGY PROGRAM  
 Procedures for sample data collection for the Clinical Pharmacology Program:  
• All samples sent to the Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) will be barcoded, with data entered and stored in the Patient Sample Data Management System (PSDMS) utilized by [CONTACT_195149]. This is a secure program, with access to PSDMS limited to defined CPP personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of PSDMS is limited to computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password restricted login screen. All CPP personnel with access to patient information annually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course.  
• PSDMS creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced back to patients without PSDMS access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, as well as box and freezer location. Patient de mographics 
associated with the Clinical C enter patient number are provided in the system. For 
each sample, there are notes associated with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).  
 Procedures for sample storage at the Clinical Pharmacology Program:  
• Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20oC or - 
80oC according to  stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the CPP 
and offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922].  
• Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in PSDMS. All researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 51 be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved 
protocol) and that any unused samples must be returned to the CPP. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_239875] a manner consistent with IRB approval.  
• Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
• If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing 
samples to be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested), and reported as such to the IRB. Any samples lost (in transit or by a researcher) or destroyed due to unknown sample integrity (i.e. broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) that meet expedited reporting requirements (see section 7.2.1)  will be reported.  
• Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the PSDMS. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate genotype with these variables.

AMPLES FOR GENETIC /GENOMIC ANALYSIS  
 Description of the scope of genetic/genomic analysis  
Tumor tissue and liquid biopsies (plasma, saliva) will be used for genomic analysis to identify somatic alterations. Bloo d will be used for “normal” DNA isolation and sequenced to identify 
somatic alterations. Whole exome, transcriptome, whole genome and/or targeted NGS will be performed in the DNA/RNA isolated from these specimens.   
 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological specimens will be maximized  
As part of study efforts to provide confidentiality of subject information, this study will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality which helps to protect personally identifiable  research 
information.  The Certificate of Confidentiality allows investigators on this trial to refuse to disclose identifying information related to the research participants, should such disclosure have adverse consequences for subjects or damage their financial standing, employability, insurability or reputation.  The informed consent includes the appropriate coverage and restrictions of the Certificate of Confidentiality.  
Tissue and blood samples collected will be coded and linked. DNA, RNA and protein isolated 
from these tissues and cell lines and xenografts generated will all be similarly coded. Only personnel involved in this study will have access to both the code and the name [CONTACT_73150]. Coded, linked tumor tissue will be sent to collaborator , [CONTACT_681626] , at 
Georgetown University for generating cell lines.  All samples  will be coded and linked without 
any patient identifiers and the Georgetown investigators will have no access to patient identification.

Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 52 To facilitate genetic resear ch, and for the purpose of publication of research work, data from 
genomic and proteomic studies may be deposited in appropriate public databases. Coded, linked 
data will be deposited in a manner that the patient’s identity cannot be traced.  
 Management of  Results    
The analyses performed in various NCI laboratories under this protocol are for research purposes only; they are not nearly as sensitive as the tests that are performed in a laboratory that is certified to perform genetic testing for clinical pur poses. Changes observed unrelated to our 
research may or may not be valid.  Therefore, we do not plan to inform participants of the results of testing on the tissue, saliva and blood that is performed in our research lab.   
However, in the unlikely event that clinically relevant incidental findings are discovered,  
subjects will be contact[CONTACT_35114] a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings that is current at the time of primary analysis.  (A list of current guidelines is maintained on the CCR intranet: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists
).  Subjects 
or their designee will be contact[CONTACT_148408] a request to provide a blood sample to be 
sent to a CLIA cert ified laboratory. If the research findings are verified in the CLIA certified 
lab, the subject will be referred to an NCI CCR Genetics Branch certified genetic health care provider for the disclosure of the results.   
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.  
The costs of CLIA testing will be paid for by [CONTACT_239945], the Branch, or the P rincipal Investigator.  If the health history, family history, or tumor diagnosis from the 
Laboratory of Pathology at the NIH Clinical Center suggests that the participant might benefit from genetic testing, we will discuss this with him/her.  
At the time of consent, subjects will be informed that incidental genetic findings may arise from this study.  Participants will be asked complete and sign an NIH -[ADDRESS_922968] withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. T he pa rticipant ’s data will be excluded from 
future distributions, but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able to be retrieved.  If samples are already analyzed , the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_681533]:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/[ADDRESS_922969] is withdrawn from further study participation.  
The Principal Investigator:  
• Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented 
• Ensures the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed, the action documented and the signed document returned to the study site 
• Ensures that the subject is  informed about the sample disposal. 
[ADDRESS_922970] protected 
electronic system s, C3D and LabMatrix, and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and 
timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist with the data management efforts. All data obtained during 
the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security standards.  Primary and  final analyzed data will have identifiers 
so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant. 
All adverse events , including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event.   Document AEs from the first study drug administration, C1D1, until [ADDRESS_922971] intervention, only adverse events which are serious and related to the study intervention need to be recorded. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Is judged by [CONTACT_52374] 
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS , FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramu ral Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major brea ch in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, this will be reported expeditiously per the requirements in section 7.2.1.

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every  8 weeks .  In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4  weeks 
following initial documentation of objective response. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).
(67)  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 55 
 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with osimertinib. 
Evaluable for objective response:  Only those patients who have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  
These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
(Note :  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also 
be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response:  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluabl e but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease reevaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as: 
• By [CONTACT_13190] x -ray: >20 mm 
• By [CONTACT_3610]:  
o Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under: >10 mm 
o Scan slice thickness >5 mm: double the slice thickness  
• With calipers on clinical exam: ≥ [ADDRESS_922972] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note : Tumor lesions that are located in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable at the discretion of the PI.  
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >[ADDRESS_922973] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed. 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including sma ll lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammator y breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
Note : Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable no r non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions ar e 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 56 Target lesions:   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target  lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by  [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of diseas e) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the [ADDRESS_922974]- LAT Lesions  
Progression:  As defined in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_922975] version 1.1 manuscript(69), at least a 
20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to  the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstra te an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
Note :  If patients progress only at the same site where LAT has been performed before, the 
progression will be considered to be a result of inadequate ablation and they will be considered for repeat LAT if clinically feasible by [CONTACT_681587] (surgery, RT, RFA , 
cryoablation ) and again re -challenged with osimertinib . Progression only at the site of previous 
LAT will n ot be considered progression for the PFS2. 
Re-initiation of osimertinib  treatment in 
this case has to be within one month. 
 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipe rs.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Conventional CT and MRI: CT and MRI - CT and MRI are the best currently available and 
reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment. For this  study 
helical m ultidetector CT will be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_922976], 
abdomen and pelvis lesions and 2-3 mm thickness for head and neck lesions. 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 57 Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases . 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
RECIST criteria will be used to determine disease progression unless there is cytological or histological confirmation of an alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia or in flammation . At the 
time of first progression when a biopsy is mandatory, biopsy will confirm disease progression.  For instances of second progression when a biopsy is not mandatory, progression determined using R ECIST criteria will be adequate to take patient off treatment.    
FDG -PET:  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the 
following algorithm. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
may be a sign o f progressive disease. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is progressive disease (PD). If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up C T scans are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site. If so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the 
anatomic images, this is not PD.  
Note : A positive FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 Response Criteri a 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by [CONTACT_308072] [ADDRESS_922977] reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neithe r sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normaliz ation of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 58 Progressive Disease (PD) : App earance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Inves tigator).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note :  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as  
“symptomatic deterioration” .  Every effort should be made to document the objective  
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overal l CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for p rogression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started.  
 Progression-Free Survival 
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time 
of progression.

9 CLINICAL MONITOR ING  
Although this study is IND- exempt, the CCR will maintain a monitoring program. The CCR’s 
program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could affect the interpretation of primary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on: 
• Informed consent process 
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability 
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessment  
 
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this study will not be affiliated in any  way with the trial conduct.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1  S
TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SAMPLE SIZ E ESTIMATE  
The primary objective is to determine PFS in patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with LAT followed by [CONTACT_602414]. Patients who progress on their initial treatment with osimertinib  and receive LAT therapy ( surgery , radiation therapy, RFA, or cryoablation) 
followed by [CONTACT_681591] (PFS2). The 
objective will be to estimate the PFS2 for these patients and also to determine if the PFS2 results may be potentially superior to the expected re sults. Data from a recently published 
study indicated that patients with NSCLC who have progressed after receiving LAT would be expected to have approximately a 6.[ADDRESS_922984] ace over approximately 3 years, and that there 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/[ADDRESS_922985] patient has received 
the LAT followed by [CONTACT_602414]  , there would be 80% power to determine that there is a 
difference between a [ADDRESS_922986], using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley as calculated via the 
following website: http://www.swogstat.org/stat/public/one_nonparametric_survival.html . 
The trial also aims to better define PFS in patients with EGFR mutation -positive NSCLC treated 
with osimertinib  prior to LAT. Data from recently published studied indicated that pati ents with 
T790M- positive EGFR inhibitor -resistant NSCLC experienced a median 9.6 month PFS 
following osimertinib  treatment and 83% of  patients treated with osimertinib at a dose of [ADDRESS_922987] their initial PFS reported in an overall group as well as separately by [CONTACT_681592] (TKI naïve vs. prior 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI treatment).   In order to recruit patients fast for the evaluation of LAT and 
re-treatment with osimertinib , a cohort of patients already treated with osimertinib  in other 
institutions in on -going clinical trials and developed acquired resistance will be included in the 
trial.  These patients will be enrolled in this study if they ar e eligible for LAT and be followed 
for PFS after LAT and re -treatment with osimertinib . 
In order to ensure that the trial does not continue to enroll patients in the event that outcomes are not adequate the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505395]. For  the patients initially 
receiving osimertinib  on the trial, the initial median PFS would be expected to be approximately 
9.6 months, with a lower two- sided 95% confidence interval bound of approximately 8.[ADDRESS_922988] administration of osimertinib  are 
substantially below what would be expected based on the previous study.  
For the patients who receive LAT, based on results from the prior published study, the median 
PFS would be 6.2 months, with a lower two -sided 95% confidence interval bound of 3.[ADDRESS_922989] additional patients expected to be necessary to result in 41 evaluable patients receiving LAT and osimertinib .  It is 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 64 antici pated that 3 to 5 years may be required to enroll adequate patients to obtain 41 who will 
receive LAT.  
10.2 METHODS FOR STATISTIC AL ANALYSES  
The progression- free survival of patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with 
LAT followed by [CONTACT_681593] –Meier method. In 
addition, the median progression- free survival will be reported along with the 95% confidence 
intervals. The results for the patients who undergo LAT are not expected to vary substantially 
accor ding to whether they were initially EGFR TKI -naïve or not.  However, the results will be 
evaluated including all patients who receive LAT as well as divided according to their initial EGFR TKI experience before treatment on this trial.  The progression- free survival of patients 
treated with osimertinib  prior to LAT will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  
Other important objectives include evaluating responses and overall survival (OS) in the patients who receive osimertinib  after LAT, as well as determining the feasibility of evaluating 
EGFR mutation status using liquid biopsies ( using blood or saliva samples ). The response rate 
will be reported using a 95% confidence interval and OS will be reported using a Kaplan- Meier 
curve. The percentage of posit ive EGFR mutation in blood or saliva samples will be reported 
and the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsies will be assessed. 
Except for the evaluation of PFS2 in patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with 
LAT followed by [CONTACT_681594] a one -sided 0.10 evaluation will be performed, all 
statistical tests will be two -sided and considered statistically significant when the p- value is 
<0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (Version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary,  
NC).

VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
 Risks 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of study therapy 
Potential risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects that are listed in 
section 13.1.[ADDRESS_922995] or minimizing 
risks will be to medically evaluate patients on a regular basis as described earlier.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-physical risks of genetic research  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Risk of receiving unwanted information 
Anxiety and stress may arise as a result of the anticipation that unwanted information regarding disease related DNA sequencing or disease tendencies, or mi sattributed 
paternity. Patients will be clearly informed that the data related to DNA sequencing and genetic analysis is coded investigational and will not be shared with patients, family members or health care providers.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_922996] 
adverse consequences for subjects or damage their financial standing, employability, insurability or reputation.  The informed consent includes the appropriate coverage and restrictions of the Certificate of Confidentiality.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of biopsy 
The risks associated with biopsies are pain and bleeding at the biopsy site. In order to minimize pain, local anesthesia will be used. Rarely, there is a risk of infection at the sampling site.  Lung 
biopsies also present the risk for pneumothorax. Tumor biopsies will be done only if it is 
clinically safe and feasible.  In addition, as up to [ADDRESS_922997] 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 67 guidance, this will result in exposure to approximately 2.4 rem. This amount is below the 
guideline of 5 rem pe r year allowed for adult research subjects by [CONTACT_517950].  
 Benefits  
Taken together, benefits of combining osimertinib  and local ablative therapy outweigh risks 
associated with the treatment.  Patients should realize that we are hopefu l that they may gain 
benefit from this study, but there is no objective evidence to support our optimism at this time. 
The potential benefit to a patient who enters study is a reduction in the bulk of his/her tumor, which may or may not have a favorable impact on symptoms and/or survival.

SIMERTINIB (AZD9291) 
Note: The commercial drugs used in this study will not alter labelling  of the FDA approved 
drugs nor does the investigation involve a route of administration or dosage level in use in a 
patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the 
acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.  The FDA has determined that this protocol is IND exempt based on this.

80mg Tablets  [COMPANY_008]  
[COMPANY_008] will supply AZD9291 as tablets for oral administration as a single daily dose of 80 
mg. AZD9291 will usually be supplied as either bulk or unlabeled  bottles for ISS/ESR studies.  
 Toxicity  
Based on the phase I study by [CONTACT_681596]., most of the a dverse effects were grade 1 or 2(33). 
The incidences of grade 3 -5 diarrhea, rash, nausea, and anorexia were 2%, 1%, 1%, and 2%, 
respectively. There were 6 cases of potential pneumonitis -like events. There were 6 patients 
who developed hyperglycemia, and 11 patients who had prolongation of QTc  interval; none of 
these events led to discontinuation or reduction of AZD9291. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate ren al impairment as well as those with mild hepatic impairment
(76). Exploratory 
analyses of clinical trials of AZD9291 suggest a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (32% vs. 25%) and more frequent dose modification for adverse reactions (23% vs. 17%) in patients 65 years or older as compared with those younger than 65 years
(76). Based on 
the two retrospective studies and one prospective study, it has been shown that local ablative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_681536] -TKI
(56-58). 
 Administration Procedures 
Osimertinib  is administered as [ADDRESS_922998] to food.  Doses should be taken approximately 24 hours apart at t he same time 
point each day. Doses should not be missed.  If a patient misses taking a scheduled dose, within 
a window of 12 hours, it is acceptable to take the dose.  If it is more than 12 hours after the dose time, the missed dose should not be taken, and patients should be instructed to take the next dose at the next scheduled time.  If a patient vomits after taking their osimertinib , they should 
not make up for this dose, but should take the next scheduled dose. 
If a patient misses more than 5 scheduled  doses of osimertinib within one cycle, this will be 
reported as a protocol deviation.  If a patient misses 1- 4 doses of osimertinib within one cycle, 
this will not be considered a deviation.  If instructed by [CONTACT_681597], held doses will not be considered a missed dose.  A patient that interrupts therapy for more 
than 4 weeks will be taken off treatment.  
The dose of osimertinib can be reduced based on the rules  described in Section  3.4. Further dose 
reductions are not possible. Once a dose has been reduced, it should not be re -escalated at future 
cycles. Any change from dosing schedule, dose interruptions, or dose reductions should be recorded.   
Patients may continue to receive osimertinib  as long as they are continuing to show clinical 
benefit, as judged by [CONTACT_737], and in the absence of discontinuation criteria. 
 Formulation  
Osimertinib  is presented for or al administration as a beige, film- coated tablet containing either 
40 mg or 80 mg of osimertinib  (expressed as the free base). O simertinib  tablets are packed in 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. Bottles are secured with a child resistant closure; 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 69 induction- sealed membranes provide tamper evidence.  
 Labelling  
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local 
regulatory guidelines.  The labels will fulfill GMP Annex [ADDRESS_922999] label on the bottle specifies the stability/expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] . 
 Incompatibilities  
As CYP3A4 is the principal P450 protein responsible for the metabolism of  osimertinib , 
AZ5104 and AZ7550, co -administration with a potent CYP3A4  inhibitor or inducer may affect 
their exposure. 
Osimertinib , AZ5104 and AZ7550 are substrates for P -gp and BCRP but are not  substrates for 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Osimertinib  is a direct inhibitor of CYP 3A4/5 in vitro using nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_681537] 
(IC50 5.1 μ M) although lower inhibition was observed with midazolam (IC50 >26.5 µ M) and 
is a weak time -dependent inhibitor of  CYP3A4 in vitro (KI and kinact of 1090 µ M and 0.0617 
min-1). The exposure  of medications dependent on CYP3A4/5 may be incre ased when 
coadministered  with osimertinib . 
Osimertinib  is an inhibitor of BCRP in vitro (IC50 of 2.0 μ M). The exposure of  medications 
dependent on BCRP may be increased when co -administered  with osimertinib  due to BCRP 
inhibition. Osimertinib  induces CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in vitro in human hepatocytes. The  exposure of 
medications dependent on CYPs 3A4 and 1A2 (also CYP2C and P- gp which may be induced) 
may be reduced when co -administered with  osimertinib . 
 Compliance 
The administration of all study drugs (including investigational products) should be recorded in 
the appropriate sections of the eCRF .

 77 15.2 APPENDIX B. GUIDANCE REGARDING POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH 
CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
The use of any natural/herbal products or other “folk remedies” should be discouraged, but use 
of these products, as well as use of all vitamins, nutritional supplements, and all other concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Osimertinib  is an investigational drug for which no data on in vivo interactions are currently 
available. Based on in vitro data and predicted clinical exposure data, osimertinib  is considered 
unlikely to cause clinically significant drug interactions through inhibition or induction of 
cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. In vitro data have shown that the principal CYP enzymes responsible for the Phase I metabolism of osimertinib  are CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. 
 
1. DRUGS INHIBITING CYP3A4 OR CYP2C8 METABOLISM THAT 
ASTRAZENECA STRONGLY RECOMMEND ARE NOT COMBINED WITH OSIMERTINIB    
The contribution of Phase I metabolism to the total clearance of osimertinib  is currently 
unknown but, to ensure patient safety, the following potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided during this study  if possible  for any patient receiving osimertinib .  If no alternative 
exists, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity.

2. DRUGS INDUCING CYP3A4 METABOLISM THAT ASTRAZENECA 
STRONGLY RECOMMEND ARE NOT COMBINED WITH OSIMERTINIB    
 
The following potent inducers  of CYP3A4 should be avoided during this study if 
possible for any patient receiving osimertinib because concomitant use may decrease 
osimertinib plasma concentrations.

There are currently no data confirming that there is a pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between 
these agents and osimertinib; in vitro data suggest osimertinib  has the potential to cause drug 
interactions at the intestinal level through CYP3A4 and BCRP, it has also been shown to be an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and inducer of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2C and p- glycoprotein. This 
list is not intended to be exhaustive, and a similar restriction will apply to other agents that are known to depend on CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP1A2 and CYP2C for metabolism or BCRP and p-glycoprotein for deposition disposition. Appropriate medical judgement is required.

 83 15.4 APPENDIX D. GUIDANCE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN STUDIES 
USING 80MG OSIMERTINIB   
Osimertinib  is a potent irreversible small molecule inhibitor of both the single EGFRm (tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitivity conferring mutations) and dual EGFRm/T790M (TKI 
resistance conferring mutation) receptor forms of EGFR, with weaker inhibition towards wild type EGFR.  
Clinical experience with 80mg osimertinib  has shown an association with the occurrence of 
dermatological adverse events (particularly rash and dry skin) and diarrhea.  The considerable majority of these events have been mild, transient events that have  not always required 
treatment.  
Based on exper ience with other EGFR and HER2 inhibitors, decreases in LVEF, anterior ocular 
effects and ILD/pneumonitis should be monitored for.   
Some guidance is provided in this document regarding these events.  
The purpose of these treatment guidelines is:  
• To prevent  tolerable adverse events becoming intolerable for the patient and leading to 
discontinuation of treatment. 
• To promote consistency of treatment for specific adverse events across the osimertinib  
clinical program.

 97 15.5 APPENDIX E. POTENTIAL DRUG INDUCED LIVER INJURY  
1. INTRODUCTION 
During the course of the study, the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. 
The Investigator assesses cases meeting PHL criteria to  determine whether Hy’s Law (HL) 
criteria are met. Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for th e elevations 
in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_255762] (IMP). 
 2. DEFINITIONS  
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) A Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) case is defined as a study patient with an increase in serum 
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN irrespective of serum Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), at any point during the study following the start of study medication.  
Hy’s Law (HL)  
An HL case is defined as a study patient with an increase in serum AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason can be found to explain the combination of increases, e.g., elevated serum ALP indicating cho lestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL to be met the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e., on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminas es and TBL must occur.  
 
3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES  
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory 
data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation o r in 
combination: 
• ALT ≥ 3xULN  
• AST ≥ 3xULN  
• TBL ≥ 2xULN  
The Investigator will, without delay, review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are met, will:  
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 of this Append ix for 
definition) by [CONTACT_48886].  
• Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF.  
 
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 98 4. FOLLOW -UP 
4.1. Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met 
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria, the Investigator will: 
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in the 
Clinical Study Protocol.  
 
4.2. Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: • Determine whether PHL  criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study treatment in 
the presence of liver metastases (See Section 6).  
The Investigator will:  
• Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  
• Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations.  
• Compl ete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available.  
• If at any time the PHL case meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures. 
 
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES  
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  The Investigator will follow the instructions below.  
If there is an alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination 
of whether the alternative explanation i s an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE 
meets the criteria for a SAE:  
• If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
• If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the eCRF 
accordingly.  
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations 
other than the IMP:  
• Record an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’).  
o The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria 
apply.  
o As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.  
 
6. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT EPI[INVESTIGATOR_681547]’S LAW  
Abbreviated Title:   LAT for NSCLC  
Version Date :  12/26/2019  
 99 This section is applicable to patients who meet PHL criteria on study treatment (including the 
[ADDRESS_923006] discontinuation of study treatment) after having previously met 
PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.  
At the first ‘on -study treatment’ occurrence of PHL criteria being met, the Investigator will: 
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met:  
• If there is no significant change, no action is required. 
• If there is a significant change, follow the subsequent process described in Section 4.2 of this Appendix. 
A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a subsequent clinically relevant change in any o f the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation 
or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms such as fatigue, vomiting, rash, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and/or eosinophilia. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
 
7. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT EPI[INVESTIGATOR_168858]’S LAW  
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment (including the 
30-day follow -up period) and has already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and answer the following question: 
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met chronic or progressing malignant disease or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study treatment and at their first ‘on -study treatment’ visit as described in Section  6?  
If No: Follow the process described in Section 6 of this Appendix.  
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met.  
• If there is no significant change, no action is required.  
• If there is a significant change, follow the process described in Section 4.2 of this Appendix.  
A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a subsequent clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms, such as fatigue, vomiting, rash, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and/or eosinophilia. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Title: Randomized Controlled Trial of Losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
1.2 Purpose:  To determine the impact of losartan compared to placebo on the rate of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125859]19 not requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125860].  
1.3 Hypothesis: Losartan will significantly reduce the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51530] 15 
days in outpatients not requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125861].  
1.4 Study design: Multi -center, prospective, randomized blinded interventional trial of 
losartan (25 mg orally twice daily)  versus placebo administered for 10 days or until 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
1.5 Study procedures:  
● The trial emphasizes early intervention to prevent the progression of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765]. Patients presenting to the emergency department or 
outpatient drive- thru COVID -[ADDRESS_141521] result 
and no more than 7 days from symptom onset.  
● Investigators and research coordinators will leverage already functional 
electronic consent procedures to enroll patients safely while also 
minimizing risk to study staff . Patients tested at all locations will be given 
a brochure with study information instructing them to contact [CONTACT_125897] a clinical trial (see attached patient -facing study 
related materials). In addition, patients receiving test results by [CONTACT_125898] a research study and that study team members may contact [CONTACT_125899]. The patient may opt -out of such followup calls.The eConsent 
platform is currently used in NIH supported StrokeNet and SIREN clinical  
trials, and are HIPAA compliant.  
● Enrolled patients will be randomized to losartan or placebo, and undergo 
daily assessment by [CONTACT_125900] -in safety and efficacy 
assessments . Enrolled participants will be delivered study drug, a 
thermometer,  oropharyngeal swabs, home blood pressure cuff, and a 
urine pregnancy test, if applicable, by [CONTACT_125901] [ADDRESS_141522] 
oropharyngeal swabs, and administer validated outpatient dyspnea 
assessments at predetermined time points.  
● Patient -collected oropharyngeal swabs will be retrieved using a courier 
service with capacity for transport of biologic specimens to a BSL- 3 
laboratory ( https://www.researchservices.umn.edu/services -

2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose :  
Since appearing in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_11520] 2 (SARS -CoV-2) has caused disease (COVID -19) in over 
155,000 people with over 5,900 deaths to date across 100 countries.1-3 The mortality is 
estimated at 3.7%,4 with infectivity (R0) estimated at 2.[ADDRESS_141525] severely affected patients are 
admitted for respi[INVESTIGATOR_125863].7,8 At present there is no 
current specific treatment for patients with COVID -19.9 The novel coronavirus is closely 
related to the severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (SARS -CoV) which caused 
an outbreak of disease (SARS) in 2003; this may inform the development of novel treatments.
9,10 Attempts to develop vaccines since SARS or middle eastern respi[INVESTIGATOR_125864] (MERS) have been unsuccessful, will take time, and may or may not be effective for this or future coronavirus pandemics.
[ADDRESS_141526] several promising novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies that differentiate this vir us from seasonal or pandemic 
influenza. Similar to the 2002 -2003 SARS -
CoV, the SARS- CoV-
2 virus binds the spi[INVESTIGATOR_125865] -
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical 
component of the renin- angiotensin-
aldosterone (RAAS) system, in order to 
enter the cell.

(Figure 1 – red 
arrow on right) 
Multiple proposed 
interventions to 
combat SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_141527] 
with the goal of 
blocking viral entry into cells, and include anti -viral agents,14 anti-malarial medications,15 
vaccines,16  and viral protein inhibitors.9 While these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_125866], immediate 
use of these interventions are not feasible. In many cases, drugs are still under 
development and lack a clinical indication, with limited safety and efficacy data in 
humans to date. These factors will necessarily lead to delays in drug development. 
Given the rapid spread of SARS -CoV-2, patients would greatly benefit from interventions

SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
with a well- established safety profile readily available for immediate clinical trial testin g 
and rapid knowledge translation if efficacious.  
2.2 Rationale and Scientific Hypothesis:  
Renin -aldosterone blockade has been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID -
19.17-19 This hypothesis was originally published by [CONTACT_16836]19 on February 16, 2020 
(manuscript published in Chinese) and in the British Medical Journal  on February 4, 
2020.[ADDRESS_141528] investigating this hypothesis.  
As opposed to ongoing clinical trials targeting viral binding and entry, the proposed 
clinical trial proposes to mitigate the respi[INVESTIGATOR_125867] -CoV-2, thereby 
[CONTACT_125906]. As illustrated in Figure 1, SARS -CoV-2 binds to 
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), similar to 2002 -2003 SARS -CoV. Molecular 
simulation has shown SARS- CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2 compared with SARS-
CoV.20  
Healthy State:  
In states of health, ACE2 converts Angiotensin 2 (ATII) into lung- protective angiotensin 
(AT) 1 -7 and 1- 9, thus preventing unopposed ATII activation of AT1R. Unopposed AT1R 
activation triggers a downstream pro- inflammatory cascade, characterized by [CONTACT_125907], acute lung injury (ALI), acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), 
and death (Figure 2).4,18 AT1R activation also leads to type II pneumocyte apoptosis, a 
common feature of ARDS.12,13 Therefore, under usual conditions of health, ACE 2 
prevents lung injury.  
Infection with SARS -CoV-2: 
Impaired ACE2 
activity due to 
binding with SARS -
CoV-2 results in 
excessive ATII 
allowing unopposed binding of AT1R 
without generation 
of lung -protective 
AT1-7 and AT1 -9 
(Figure 2) .
21,22 An 
ongoing clinical trial 
is attempting to 
exploit this 
mechanism by 
[CONTACT_125908] 24 patients 
with recombinant 
human ACE2 (rhACE2) infusions.
[ADDRESS_141529] previously been shown to result in 
decreased AT2 and increased AT1- 7.24 Unfortunately, protein recombinant human 
infusions are costly and scaling production will take significant time.  
Given this, we propose to leverage a readily available angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with an excellent safety profile, losartan, to mitigate this pathway with the aim of 

MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
decreasing ALI/ARDS. While ACE inhibitors (ACEi) could also be considered for trial, 
ACEi are frequently associated with cough which could exacerbate the spread of the disease. In 2 8 week studies, studies, losartan had 17% and 27% rates of cough vs 69% 
and 62% (see package insert). Furthermore, ACE inhibitors can induce expression of ACE2 secondary to low local angiotensin II levels, potentially increasing viral uptake.  
 
Preclinical Supporting Data:   
 
SARS- CoV specific preclinical work:  
In 2003, ACE2 was identified as the binding protein for SARS -CoV.25 This was validated in 2005 
by [CONTACT_125909]. This same study identified that SARS- CoV injury worsens acute lung injury and 
can be attenuated by [CONTACT_125910]- Angiotensin (RAS) pathway inhibition.[ADDRESS_141530] identified that 
ACE2 knockout mice had significantly lower viral loads in the lung following infection, whereas 
wildtype (wt) mice had very high viral loads.22 Additionally, wt mice had significantly higher lung 
injury scores following SARS -CoV infection.22 SARS -CoV infection results in downregulation of 
its binding protein ACE2 (ACE2 has been shown to be lung protective in its action of converting AT2 -> AT1 -7).
22 This finding that SARS- CoV results in downregulation of ACE2 has been 
validated in subsequent studies.26 Kuba et al, then showed that treatment with Losartan 15 
mg/kg attenuated lung injury ( Figure 3B)  and the development of pulmonary edema (Figure 
3C) in mice infected with SARS- CoV Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -FC.22 For this study 2.5- 3 month old mice received 
SARS- CoV Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -FC. 30 minutes later they received HCL to expedite lung injury. Mice were 
then randomized to Losartan vs vehicle. 1 and 2 hours later SARS -CoV Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -FC. Mice then 
received 3 hours of mechanical ventilation and were sacrificed. (Figures 3B and C).  22  
 
 In 2005, Imai et al 
showed that loss of 
ACE2 leads to significantly worse

VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
oxygenation, massive lung edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration in mice compared to 
wildtype mice in response to acid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].21 They then performed a rescue experiment and 
showed that supplementation with rhACE2 rescued infected mice (Figure 4A, B: green circles 
vs purple triangle and dark pi[INVESTIGATOR_125868]) .21  
Imai et al. demonstrated inhibition of AT1R via 
losartan reduced lung injury (Figure 5, light purple 
triangle) compared with vehicle (Figure 5, purple 
square) . This pathway was specific to inhibition of 
AT1R as, inhibition of AT2R did not reduce lung injury 
(Figure 5, pi[INVESTIGATOR_125869])  For this study ACE2 
knockout (KO) mice were g iven AT1R (losartan) or 
AT2R 30 minutes prior to acid- induced acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS).[ADDRESS_141531] with 
ACE2:  
 
Both influenza H7N9 and H5N1 have been implicated 
to cause lung injury through ACE2 with resultant 
upregulation of angiotensin- 2 and AT1R induced lung 
injury (Zou et al., Nature Communications, 2014 and 
Yang et al, Sci Rep, 2014).27,28 Yiwu et al found that Losartan at doses equivalent to those used 
for clinical treatment of humans  were associated with increased survival, decreased lung edema 
and lung injury scores, and decreased IL- 6 for mice infected with H5N1 (Figure 6 A -E) (Yiwu et 
al, Sci China Life Sci, 2015).29  
 Yang et al infected 4 -week -old mice with either influenza H7N9 or placebo.
28 Mice were given 
Losartan 30 minutes prior to viral infection. They identified that inhibition of AT1R attenuates 
H7N9 lung 
injury and 
was 
associated 
with lower wet-dry 
ratios and lower 
infiltrative 
cell counts 
(Yang et al, 
Sci Rep, 2014).

 2.3 Existing Literature:   
 There is no existing literature regarding the effect of losartan in COVID -19. To that 
effect there is limited literature regarding the effectiveness of any treatments on 
COVID -19. Data of relevance to are summarized in 2.1- 2.3.  
There is an urgency to identify effective and readily available treatments for patients with COVID -19. This proposed study will elucidate the role of losartan, this is based on strong 
physiologic and preclinical data as described in detail above.  
There is a critical and dire need to identify and evaluate all possible methods to 
minimize the burden of COVID -19 on our society and healthcare system.  At the 
current rate of growth (as of 3/13/2020) America is 1 week from widespread outbreak similar to Italy and Iran. Unfortunately, current community efforts are no t sufficiently  
slowing down spread as our slope (see Figure below) is higher in the last few days than the rest of the world.  
 
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcomes:  The primary endpoint is the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125870] 15 days from randomization.  
3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):  

MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
● Subjective improvement in dyspnea as measured by [CONTACT_125911] (survey attached) at day 0, 4 and 10  
● Daily maximum temperature  
● Number of emergency department or clinic presentations within 28 days  
● Disease  severity rating on the 7- point ordinal scale [ Time Frame: Day 7, 
15, 28  ] 
o The 7-point ordinal scale  is an assessment of the clinical status at 
the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 
1) Death; 2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
on non- invasi ve ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on 
activities; 7) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities  
● Change in viral  load by [CONTACT_125912]  
● Ventilator free days, oxygen free days  
● Need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125871] 15 days  
3.3 Justification of the primary outcome:  This trial seeks to mitigate lung injury from 
COVID -[ADDRESS_141532] patients present to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125872], and the primary mechanism of death is via 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_125873] -system organ failure. Prevention of acute lung 
injury with an angiotensin receptor blocker such  as losartan may reduce the 
development of the primary need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This is a clinically relevant 
outcome  not only to patients, but also to the healthcare system due to 
overwhelming surge of patients straining hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125874] -19 at risk, but also those admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125875]. It is important to emphasize the critical need for research studies that identify 
effective treatments that mitigate the progression of disease requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . To 
provide a specific example , Minneapolis has a metropolitan population of 3.4 million 
residents with approximately 5000 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125876] 500 ICU beds. If only 1% of the Minneapolis population developed symptomatic CO VID-19 that would equate to 
34,000 patients. Studies support a 13 -15% hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125877] (as of the 
time of this writing [LOCATION_001] state has 421 cases, 50 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 13 in ICU) and 
internationally
30 which would constitute 4420 – 5100 beds, nearly the entire metropolitan 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125878].  
3.4 Justification of the secondary outcomes:  Validated study instruments to assess 
dyspnea and physical function will assess patient -centered outcomes and strengthen the 
biologic plausibility of the intervention. A decrease in inflammation through the reduction of pulmonary edema may be observed as a change in fever. The study drug could affect 
the number of presentations requiring evaluation but not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
The 7 -point ordinal scale described is used by [CONTACT_125913]- 19 clinical trials and 
will allow harmonization of the trial results.  
 
4.0 Study Interventions / Interventional Agents  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
4.1 Intervention arm:  The intervention is losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, in 
microcrystalline m ethylcellulose, administered at 25 mg PO twice daily for 10 days 
(patients with eGFR 30 -60 mL/min/1.73 m2 will be given 25 mg once daily) or until 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], whichever comes first.  
● Rationale for the duration of the intervention: The average time from 
symptom onset to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125879] [ADDRESS_141533] participants to reach their primary endpoint within 10 days of 
treatment (11-12 days from symptom onset), which represents our time of 
maximal efficacy of the intervention in this cohort. We have chosen to stop treatment at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125880] a participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], introducing significant logistical 
limitations.   
● Rationale for the dose of treatment:  The lowest dose of losartan is [ADDRESS_141534] 37% inhibition of angiotensin- II 
receptors, which we believe represents an excellent risk: benefit ratio for trial participants. At the highest maximum allowable clinical dose (50 mg 
twice daily) we would anticipate 50% inhibition of angiotensin -II 
receptor.
32 Multiple early pharmacokinetic studies of losartan at the  low-
dose demonstrates the drug has minimal side effects on blood pressure  
(consistently <10 mmHg reduction in maximal systolic blood pressure) in 
healthy patients33-36 without an overactive renin- angiotensin -aldosterone 
system . Clinical exclusion criteria has been added to identify patients who 
might be at increased risk for side effects.  Patients with moderate renal 
dysfunction (eGFR 30 -60 mL/min/1.73 m2 will be given 25 mg once daily 
given impaired renal clearance.  
 
4.2 Placebo arm . Placebo capsules will match, and contain microcrystalline 
methylcellulose only.  
4.3 Investigational new drug. The study will undergo pre- IND review with the Food 
and Drug Administration to determine the need for an investigational new drug assessment, and will be assigned an IND number if required. 
4.4 Timing of the intervention: Treatment will continue for 10 days or attainment of 
the primary outcome (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]).  
4.5 Duration of study participation:  The final follow -up will occur at 90 days after 
randomization to determine epi[INVESTIGATOR_125881]. Data analysis is 
expected to be completed within 1 year  of enrollment of the final patient.  
4.6 Drug Handling, blinding, and randomization:   
Fairview Investigational Drug Services (IDS), part of M Health Fairview will oversee the 
preparation of treatment drug and placebo. Identical pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (#20) will be placed in identical 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
bottles with a deidentified study number coded by [CONTACT_125914] (e.g. 01 -001, 
02-001, etc.). A site -specific randomization schema will be created (each site will 
undergo permuted block randomization with random  block  sizes stratified by [CONTACT_125915]). Given significant differences in outcome by [CONTACT_654], patients will be randomized by 
[CONTACT_125916] (>=50, <50).  Randomization allocation will be 1:1. IDS will not be blinded to 
patient randomization. All other members of the study, the participants, and the clinical 
care team will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
4.7 Provision  of study drug to patients: Following randomization,  a courier service will 
ship drugs to study participants within 24 hours of randomization. Each dispensing will 
contain 20 caps ules, enough to complete the 10 -day therapy  
4.8 Study unblinding: MHealth Fairview, East bank Inpatient Pharmacy UMMC 
campus, will hold the blind for all subjects on study. In the event of an emergency and 
unblinding is necessary, study staff can contact 612-2 73-3066, option 1, then option 2. 
This information is included on each label.  
4.9 Biosafety : N/A. The intervention is not a biohazard.  
 
4.10 Stem Cells:  N/A 
4.11 Fetal Tissue:  N/A 
4.12 Use of radiation: N/A  
4.13 Use of Center for Magnetic Resonance Research:  N/A 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Screening: Screening logs containing non -identifiable information (age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, location of presentation, and reason for exclusion) will be maintained for patients screened but not enrolled. Patient screening will follow one of two screening procedures based on the location of their presentation.  
● Emergency department or COVID -specific clinic patients:  Initial pre -
screening to determine study eligibility will necessarily proceed under 
waiver of informed consent and waiver of HIPAA  authorization through 
the screening of electronic medical records by [CONTACT_125917]. Providers may 
contact [CONTACT_125918] -screening, as well. If the patient 
appears to be eligible based on pre- screening, and if acceptable to the 
treating physician, the patient will be approached by a study investigator 
or delegated study coordinator or research nurse to determine eligibility criteria. Patients seen in the emergency department but whose test 
results did not result prior to discharge will be given a study brochure with information to contact [CONTACT_125919]. In addition, each site has 
clinical staf f to call and alert patients regarding positive test results. These 
staff will alert the patient that they are eligible for a research study and 
that they may be contact[CONTACT_107801], and will be given the 
opportunity to opt -out of this research contact. Once contact [CONTACT_125920], study personnel will conduct a screening questionnaire to determine eligibility criteria.  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
● Drive -thru clinical patients: M Health Fairview will have [ADDRESS_141535] our study coordinators (see attached study related 
materials). Once contact [CONTACT_125921], study personnel will conduct a screening questionnaire to determine eligibility criteria.  
● Dashboard: In addition, participating sites have an electronic dashboard  
or electronic -medical record based report  of all pending and confirmed 
positive COVID -19 tests that can be used for real -time prescreening of 
emergency department or COVID -clinic patients . 
5.2 Enrollment: Patients or their legally authorized representative, with due 
consideration of vulnerable patient populations, (see section 9) will be eligible for consent by [CONTACT_125922]. Enrollment will similarly occur via one of two methods based on location of identification. In all cases, 
consent converations will occur  via telemedicine, institutionally approved 
video connection platform,  or phone call (drive through patients or ED 
patients discharged prior to randomization) which limit traditional  face-to-
face contact . If the participant regains capacity to consent, we will reconsent  the 
participant in the study. If they decline, further study procedures will stop but previously collected data under the LAR consent will be utilized. If the participant 
does not regain capacity to consent, study procedures will continue under consent 
of the LAR.  
● Rationale for the use of telemedicine, video connection,  or phone 
consent: We have chosen this method of consent in order to minimize 
risk to research team and healthcare providers, and to decrease 
community spread of the disease. We have prior experience using 
telemedicine and phone consent coupled with electronic consent form 
review for time-sensitive clinical trials of stroke . While the rationale for 
eConsent is different in this case (minimization of disease spread during a pandemic), we belie ve it is appropriate  for the disease and intervention 
being studied. LARs will not be used for remote consent. Critically, the low-dose and established safety profile  of losartan, with multiple studies 
demonstrating minimal side effects on blood pressure i n healthy 
patients33-36 without an overactive renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system, 
combined with the close remote follow -up methods proposed in this study 
make the risk: benefit ratio for the alteration of traditional consent process 
acceptable for participants, providers, and the public.  
● Emergency department  or COVID -clinic  patients (patient is still in the 
emergency department  or clinic ): For the sake of healthcare provider 
safety, a nd to minimize the spread of the virus, this visit will occur via a 
HIPAA compliant telemedicine consultation using tablets with 
telemedicine capabilities housed in the emergency department or with the 
study team.  At this visit, consents will be reviewed in detail with the 
subject or LAR. The subject or LAR will have the opportunity to ask questions. If the patient (or LAR) agrees to become a study participant, 
electronic consent will be obtained using HIPAA and rule 11 compliant 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
electronic consent, stored and maintained in a secure RedCap server 
(see departmental policy on eConsent, attached).  
● Non-emergency department  or COVID -clinic  patients (patient returned 
home) or drive- thru clinic patients: For the sake of healthcare provider 
safety, and to minimize the spread of the virus, pre -screening and 
consent will occur through a video connection or phone call.  At this visit, 
consents will be reviewed in detail with the potential participant . The 
potential participant  will have the opportunity to ask questions . If the 
participant agrees to become a study participant, electronic consent will 
be obtained using HIPAA and rule 11 compliant electronic consent, 
stored and maintained in a secure RedCap server (see departmental 
policy on eConsent).  
●  Eligible patients who meet inclusion criteria but do not have a 
documented creatinine and blood pressure reading within [ADDRESS_141536] results will undergo remote consent 
and enrolled. However, prior to randomization they will be required to 
participate in additional study screening at a clinic location prepared to accept known COVID- 19 positive patients. The additional screening 
procedures will include: a blood pressure, creatinine, and potassium.
 
 
5.3 Administration of study drug: Patients will be given prepared components 
necessary for conduct of the study, including study drug (losartan or placebo), a 
thermometer, a home blood pressure cuff, and oropharyngeal  swabs shipped 
supplies via same- day courier service.  
5.4 Patient follow -up: Participants will receive phone calls by [CONTACT_125923] [ADDRESS_141537] daily blood pressure (measured at 
least once  by [CONTACT_125924]. Data will be documented into a Redcap database. The coordinators 
will have participants  complete 2 qualitative surveys at enrollment, day 4, and day 
10 (both attached in supplement). Surveys and adverse event assessments conducted within 1 day of the time point will be counted as qualifying and not 
considered missing. At day 15 (+/ - 2 day), patients will be asked t o return for 
repeat research blood draw to include creatinine testing. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_125925]  28 (+/ - 3 days) and 90  (+/- 3 days)  for short and intermediate term 
outcomes . If there is no follow -up due to lack of patient response, this w ill be 
documented and not counted as a protocol deviation.

6.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
6.1 Data  management:  
● Storage and Access:  Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical 
research staff under the supervision of Drs. Tignanelli and Puskarich. 
Study data will be recorded within a RedCAP database with study 
personnel being granted access to the database based on the tasks listed in the Delegation of Authority log. Only deidentified data sets with all PHI 
removed will be shared for data analysis.  The electronic consent 
(eConsent) forms, which will be maintained in a University of Minnesota RedCap database with established functionality for this purpose in our 
group. The database is HIPAA compliant.  
● Monitoring:  A monitor from Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI) 
or designated study monitor will review 100% of electronic consent documents, study drug administration data, and SAE reporting. 
Additionally, a random sampling of 5% of subjects will undergo full evaluation and comparison of source documentation with data entered into the study database. The first data monitoring visit will be scheduled 
once 10% of the cohort has been enrolled, with repeat monitoring after 50% and 100% of enrollments. Monitors will evaluate 100% of users to 
ensure assigned access is consistent with training and delegation of 
authority logs.  
●  Release/Sharing:  Data will be shared among members of the study team 
with appropriate access assigned in Redcap based on study role, training, and delegation of authority. Data will be made available to assigned study 
monitors, the data safety monitoring board, the appropriate University of 
Minnesota oversight authorities, the Food and Drug Administration, and 
other state and federal regulatory authorities as required by [CONTACT_125926].  
● Data sharing: Requests for data following study completion for sharing 
will be evaluated by a steering committee that will be established and will 
include the principal investigators. Requests will be evaluated on a case-
by-case basis. If data are shared, only deidentified data will be shared.  
6.2 Biospecimen management:  
● Specimen banking:  Biologic specimens (oropharyngeal swabs) provided 
by [CONTACT_125927] (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
diseases. Specimens will be transported and processed by [CONTACT_125928]- 3 laboratory and frozen at - 80 C until the time of 
analysis. Samples will be deidentified and labeled only with a patient ID 
number.  
● Biospecimens and protocol deviations: Baseline clinical laboratory results 
will be required to establish inclusion and exclusion criteria, and missing 
data will be reported as protocol deviations. However, significant barriers exist to the collection and processing of other biospecimens due to the 
increased containment required, meaning that not every study site may 
be able to accomplish these procedures. In addition, patient self -
collection will lead to missing samples. While every effort will be made to obtain these biospecimens, failure to do so will not constitute protocol 
deviations.  
● Specimen sharing:   Requests for specimen sharing during or following 
study completion for sharing will be evaluated by a steering committee that will be established and will include the principal investigators. 
Requests will be evaluated on a case- by-case basis. If specimens are 
shared, human genetic analysis will only proceed on those patients who opt-in to genetic testing. Genetic testing of viral genomes will be allowed 
to proceed on all patients.  
7.0 Sharing of Results with Participants  
7.1 Sharing of results: Data collected within this study will be obtained from the 
participants themselves and recorded on collection templates or directly into 
Redcap, or will be obtained from the electronic medical record and thus are already available to the patient and treatment team. Any testing of biospecimens 
will occur at a later time point and do have specific clinical relevance and will not 
be shared with the patient.  
7.2 Sharing of genetic testing 
● Disclosure of results:  There is no plan to disclose genetic results to the 
patients as none is yet planned.   
● If returning results to participants: N/A  
7.3 Future analysis of genotypes:  Genetic testing, while potentially an area of future 
investigation as a means to determine if participants with specific genetic differences are more or less susceptible to COVID -19, is not currently planned nor funded. As such, 
data will not be disclosed  to the participants. To the extent possible in future work, 
participants or families with rare variants will undergo attempts at anonymization.   
8.0 Study Population  
8.1 Inclusion Criteria  
● Positive laboratory test for COVID -[ADDRESS_141540]   
● Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age 
● Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (cough, rhinorrhea) or fever (>101.5)  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
8.2 Rationale for inclusion criteria: This is a pragmatic trial looking to enroll a diverse 
cohort of participants so the results may be broadly applicable to a wide patient 
population if efficacious. We do not have sufficient data to support lack of efficacy in a 
specific subgroup at this time to justify their exclusion. While we currently propose to 
exclude children due to insufficient time at the writing of this protocol to closely scrutinize 
safety and dosing in that group, along with logistical challenges of having different 
doses, we have plans to evaluate the possibility of expanding to include that patient 
population as soon as logistically feasible.  Patients must be symptomatic to avoid 
enrolling asymptomatic carriers unlikely to meet the primary outcome.  
8.3 Exclusion Criteria  
● Randomization > 72 hours of meeting inclusion criteria 
● Randomization > 7 days of symptom onset  
● Currently taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or 
Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)  
● Prior reaction or intolerance to an ARB or ACE inhibitor, including  but not 
limited to angioedema  
● Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
● Women able to have children not currently taking a protocol allowed version of contraception: intrauterine device, Depo- formulation of 
hormonal contraception (e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate /  Depo -
Provera), subcutaneous contraceptive (e.g. Nexplanon), daily oral contraceptives with verbalized commitment to taking daily throughout the 
study, condom use or abstinence during the study. All women of child 
bearing age enrolled in this fashion will be informed of the teratogenic 
risks.   
● Patient reported history or electronic medical record history of kidney disease, defined as:  
o Any history of dialysis  
o History of chronic kidney disease stage III or IV  
o Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of < 30ml/min/1.73 
m
2 (must be have been measured within 1 month of enrollment) 
o Other kidney disease that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would 
affect losartan clearance  
● Patient reported dehydration and significantly decreased urine output in 
the past 72 hours  
● Most recent systolic  blood pressure prior to enrollment <110  mmHg  
● Patient reported history or electronic medical record history of severe liver 
disease, defined as:  
o Cirrhosis  
o History of hepatitis B or C  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
o Other liver disease that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15863], would 
affect losartan clearance  
o Documented AST or ALT > 3 times the upper limit of normal within 
3 months of randomization (if available in electronic medical 
record)  
● Potassium >5.0 mmol/L (must have been measured within 1 month) of enrollment  
● Concurrent treatment with aliskiren  
● Inability to obtain informed consent  
8.4 Rationale for exclusion criteria: We expect treatment results to be available within 
[ADDRESS_141541] symptoms, so patients with >[ADDRESS_141542] limited potential for benefit. Patients already taking or with prior adverse 
events to either an ACE inhibitor or ARB are excluded for risk of side effects. Losartan is 
a class D drug. Women of child bearing age (14- 40) without a history of hysterectomy 
must have a documented negative pregnancy test in the emergency department  or clinic 
in the past [ADDRESS_141543] potassium and creatinine screening to decrease the risk of 
both kidney injury and decreased clearance. Patients on dialysis or with and eGFR <[ADDRESS_141544] half -dosing. Patients with a documented potassium 
>5.0 will be excluded. Patients with hypotension will be excluded given an expected 
decrease of 6 -8 mmHg in their blood pressure. Finally, all patients or their legally 
authorized representative will provide prospective written informed consent.  
 
9.0 Vulnerable Populations  
9.1 Vulnerable Populations: By [CONTACT_125929] -[ADDRESS_141545] additional characteristics that add to this 
vulnerability. Our criteria for inclusion and exclusion of each of these groups is summarized below, followed by [CONTACT_125930]. Our group has significant experience enrolling vulnerable patients in 
emergency care trials , and experience with a diverse population of potential participants 
in high stress situations.

9.2 Additional safeguards: 
● Non-English speakers : Excluding this group would compromise the principle of 
justice in clinical research. For groups likely to be enrolled given our known 
demographics (Spanish- speaking and Somali -speaking), we will translate 
informed consent forms (ICF) and use professional interpreters during both the consent and follow -up periods. These interpreters are available to our group 
during daytime hours  by [CONTACT_756]. We will request the use of the Short Form 
Consent for non- English speaking participants , and adhere to the regulations 
surrounding its use.  When the translated ICsF become available, they will be 
used for non -English speakers.
 
● Employees or students of the researcher: To minimize the potential for  coercion, 
any employee or student of the research will undergo screening and informed consent by [CONTACT_3462], but not by [CONTACT_125931]. The screening will not be performed by 
[CONTACT_125932], so this group may opt out in a deidentified 
fashion at that stage. Furthermore, if the potential participant wants to enroll, all 
interactions will occur with a different study investigator (such as the other co-
principal investigator. These two clinical investigators work in different 
departments with different staff).   
● Undervalued or disenfranchised social group:  We will assure confidentiality, that 
they have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have the 
freedom to refuse to answer questions.   
● Active members of the military (service members), DoD personnel (including 
civilian employees):  The status of participants of this group is not asked during 
the study nor known by [CONTACT_464], and therefore  vulnerability is not increased for 
anyone in this group.   
● Individual or group that is disadvantaged in the distribution of social goods and services such as income, housing, or healthcare: We will assure that information 
from participants in this study will be treated with the strictest confidentiality, that 
participants have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have 
the freedom to refuse to answer questions.
 
● Individual or group with a serious health condition for which there are no satisfactory standard treatments:  We will assure confidentiality, that they have 
the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have the freedom to 
refuse to answer questions. We will also employ the teach -back method to 
ensure participants understand risks and demands of study participation.  
 
● Individual or group with a fear of negative consequences for not participating in 
the research (e.g. institutionalization, deportation, disclosure of stigmatizing 
behavior):  The status of participants from these groups is not asked during the 
study nor known by [CONTACT_464], and that vulnerability is not increased for anyone in this group.

of the drive -thru clinic tested for COVID -19 will receive an informational brochure 
(attached as addendum) which provides information about testing, call -back, and the 
study. A phone number, email, and website will be created to allow participant to 
express interest in the study.   
11.4 Payment:  Patients will be eligible for a $[ADDRESS_141547] for their time to return for the 
15-day blood draw for renal function testing . 
12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
12.1 Withdrawal Ci rcumstances:  Participants may be withdrawn from research without 
their consent if they develop SAEs that the investigator believes to be likely related to the study drug. Participants may also be withdrawn from the study for repeated 
treatment non -adherenc e. Participants may also withdraw from the study at any time for 
any reason. All data from patients withdrawn from the study will be analyzed using intent 
to treat principles.  
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  If patients choose to withdraw, study procedures 
includin g intervention and follow -ups will stop. Given the remote nature of this study, 
written notification is not required. If the patient chooses to withdraw, the study team will 
ask if the patient is willing to allow continued electronic medical record evaluat ion for the 
determination of study endpoints (partial withdrawal). We will also ask if the patient wishes to withdraw consent for the use of future biologic specimens. If the patients declines to participate in any component of research, no further study data will be 
collected, biologic samples will be destroyed, but existing study data may be used. Each 
of these circumstances will be documented and stored as a study document. 
12.3 Termination Procedures:  Upon trial termination, study outcomes will be followed 
until completion. Case report forms and collection templates will be maintained in paper 
format (when application) and electronically for 7 years in accordance with regulations. 
Collected data will be used for secondary analyses with approval of the principal 
investigators in a deidentified fashion. Data entry will be completed, checked for 
accuracy, and locked for analysis within 1 year of enrollment of the final patient.  
13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  Potential risks of losartan are detailed in consent forms. The 
most severe risks of losartan use include teratogenicity in the setting of pregnancy, 
hypersensitivity including angioedema, symptomatic hypotension, worsening of 
renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities.  The most common side effects of 
losartan include fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, chest pain and anemia.  Subjects will be rigorously screened to ensure that they are at low risk for complications due to 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
losartan and they will be monitored closely for side effects and signs of toxicity. 
The package insert for Losartan has been included with this protocol. Clinical trial and post -marketing surveillance data (see package insert) demonstrate an 
excellent safety profile. In over 4,000 patients, there was a low incidence of adverse events (2.3%) comparable to placebo (3.7%). The effects more common 
in losartan than placebo were clinically minor, including dizziness (3% vs 2%), 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (8% vs 7%), nasal congestion (2% vs 1%) and back pain (2% vs 1%). While losartan has the potential to cause symptomatic 
hypotension, four studies have identified losartan has a negligible effect on resting 
blood pressure and heart rate in healthy volunteers.
34-[ADDRESS_141548] recent 
preprinted (non -peer reviewed) data from China now suggest a protective effect 
based on retrospective data compared to other antihypertensive regiments. 
However, this will be monitored carefully through admission rates and AE/SAE 
reporting to the DSMB, in addition to continuous monitoring of the primary outcome 
by [CONTACT_4318] . 
13.2 Reproduction Risks:  Losartan is  class D in pregnancy. Women of childbearing age 
will only be eligible for enrollment with a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment. In addition, women breastfeeding will be excluded from the study.  
13.3 Risks to Others:  The primary risk to others is the risk to study personnel of 
becoming infected with COVID -19. To overcome this barrier, patients will be 
enrolled using an electronic consent process already established among our group for other studies. In addition, follow -up evaluations will preferentially be performed 
by [CONTACT_648]. If a face- to-face evaluation or physical examination is required due to 
concern for adverse events, participants will be directed to a clinic or emergency department that is prepared for management of patients with COVID -19, and 
instructed on techniques to minimize exposure of others. Participants will generate 
potential biohazards (oropharyngeal swabs), the safety steps surrounding which are discussed in section 6.2.  
14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
14.1 Potential Benefits:  If randomized to the intervention arm, and if losartan is 
demonstrated to prevent the progression of acute lung injury, patients may benefit by [CONTACT_125933], decreased need for oxygen or mechanical ventilation, or possibly lower mortality. If randomized to the control arm, there is no 
direct potential benefit to the patient. However, the proposed research has the 
potential to significantly benefit people infected with COVID -19. 
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan:  All analysis will focu s on comparisons between the treatment 
and control groups. Demographics and other baseline clinical characteristics will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics will be presented by 
[CONTACT_125934],emt group using mean, standard deviation,  median, and interquartile range 
(IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The primary outcome, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125883] 15, will be summarized by [CONTACT_125935] 95% asymptotic confidence intervals. 
Treatment groups will be compared using the Chi- square test and the treatment

effect will be summarized by [CONTACT_125936][INVESTIGATOR_125884].  Secondary endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_125937]- sample unequal variance t -test, 
potentially after appropriate data transformations to assure that assumptions of the t-test are met. Time -to-event endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier curves 
and compared using Cox proportional hazards regression. For all endpoints, we will complete secondary analyses comparing for important baseline variables that are unequally distributed between treatment groups. Preplanned subgroup 
analyses are planned by [CONTACT_654] (dichotomized at 50 and by [CONTACT_125938]), history of 
hypertension, sex, and smoking history, timing of randomization from symptom 
onset, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_125885].  In addition, we 
will perform a preplanned pooled analysis with a planned national outpatient trial of losartan versus placebo targeting the same patient population with harmonized 
assessments and outcomes.  
15.2 Power Analysis: Previously published literature from  China suggest a 15% 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125886].
7,[ADDRESS_141549] a difference 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125887] 15% in control vs. 7% in the intervention group, with 
alpha of 0.05 and 80% power using a two- sided test, we will need 264 patients in 
each group.  We will enroll a total of 290 patients in each group (total sample size of 
580) to account for the possibility of 10% loss -to-follow -up. 
15.3 Data Integrity:  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_125888].  Recruitment of subjects will be performed using inclusion/exclusion criteria defined above. Study data will be recorded within a RedCAP database, 
which is HIPAA compliant, password protected with variable assignable security access and an audit trail consistent with all regulatory requirements for 
maintenance of clinical trial data. Data summaries and quality control checks will 
be run routinely.

environment.  Only the principal investigators and study nurses will hav e access to 
this file.  
 
16.10  Sharing of Data with Research Team Members: A fully de -identified (of all PHI) 
database will be generated which will be used for statistical analysis and for monitoring by [CONTACT_74583]. This database will exist within Redcap.  
16.11  Storage and Disposal of Paper Documents:  At this time we do not anticipate any 
paper documents related to this study. Everything, including consents will be done electronically. If the need for paper collection templates becomes evident, these 
documents will be stored in locked rooms where only study personnel have 
access. They will be maintained for 7 years as legally required, after which time 
they will either be destroyed or moved to long -term storage.  
17.0 Confidentiality  
17.1 Data Security:  All data will be stored on servers (Redcap and CTSI AHC -IE data 
shelter) managed by [CONTACT_125941]. No data will be stored on 
individual research computers, flash drives, etc. These servers Redcap and the data shelter meet all data regulatory requirements and are HIPAA compliant.  
18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
18.1 Data Integrity Monitoring: Data entry will be performed by [CONTACT_125942] . Data 
integrity will be overseen by [CONTACT_7676]. A monitor from Clinical Translational Science 
Institute (CTSI) will review 100% of electronic consent documents, study drug 
administration data, and SAE reporting. Additionally, a random sampling of 5% of 
subjects will undergo full evaluation and comparison of source documentation with 
data entered into the study database. The first data monitoring visit will be 
scheduled once 10% of the cohort has been enrolled, with repeat monitoring after 
50% and 100% of enrollments. Monitors will evaluate 100% of users to ensure 
assigned access is consistent with training and delegation of authority logs. The project research coordinators at the sites will maintain binders containing pertinent 
documents and information including IRB approval letters, documentation of GCP 
training, licenses, human subjects research ethics training certificates, curriculum 
vitae, and correspondence.  
18.2 Adverse events reporting  
● Definition of an Adverse Event (AE): An AE is any symptom, sign, illness , 
or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of 
the study but does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study 
agent/intervention or procedures.   A clinical trial adverse event is defined 
as any untoward medical event associated with the use of a drug or study 
procedure. The Investigators will determine daily if any adverse events 
occur during the period from enrollment (signing of the informed consent) 
through study day 15. Investigators will determine if the event is se rious 
or related to the study drug. The rationale for this time window is the half -
life of 2 hours for losartan and 6 -9 hours for its metabolite.   Even in the 
setting of impaired clearance, 3 days after study drug cessation is more 
than adequate to help to  define the period at risk from losartan. Abnormal 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the 
abnormality:  
o results in study withdrawal,  
o is associated with a serious adverse event (SAE),  
o leads  to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests, or  
o is considered by [CONTACT_125943]. 
● Definition of a Serious Adverse Event : Adverse events are classified as 
serious or non -serious.   An SAE is any AE that is:  
o Fatal,  
o life-threatening,  
o requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408],  
o results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 
o a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or  
o an important medical event.  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately 
life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They 
may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_141553] 
15 study days, regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_125890]. Thereafter, serious adverse events are not required to 
be reported unless the investigator feels the events were related 
to either study drug or a protocol procedure.  
Study site personnel must alert a study investigator of any serious and study drug or study procedure related adverse event within 24 hours of 
investigator awareness of the event. Alerts issued via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on the adverse event case 
report form.  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded 
as non- serious AEs.  
● Preexisting Condition: A preexisting condition is one that is present at the 
start of the study.   A preexistin g condition will be recorded as an AE if the 
frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
● Post-study Adverse Event: All unresolved AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_125944], the subject is lost to follow -up, 
or the AE is otherwise explained.   At the last scheduled visit, study 
personnel will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) within [ADDRESS_141554]’s 
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
personal physician,  believes might reasonably be related to participation 
in this study.   
● Abnormal Laboratory Values: A clinical laboratory abnormality should be 
documented as an AE if any 1 of the following conditions is met:  
o  The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that 
worsened from the time of enrollment, or  
o The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; 
e.g., change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent 
follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
● Continuous SAEs of interest monitoring: The following SAEs will be 
continuously reported to the DSMB: deaths, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
cardiovascular events (need for vasoactive drugs or fluids for 
hypotension), or respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (worsening hypoxia, worsening acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or new respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]).  
● Other c linical Outcomes that may be exempt from adverse event 
reporting: Study specific outcomes as outlined in 5.1 and 5.2 are exempt 
from adverse event reporting unless the investigator deems the event to 
be related to the study procedures (or of uncertain relationship) or if the 
event leads to discontinuation of study procedures. The following are examples of events that will be considered study specific clinical 
outcomes and will be systematically tracked through the study design. 
The rationale for this criteria is that adverse event reporting can be 
sporadic and inconsistent, so events more likely to be truly related to a 
study intervention are better treated by [CONTACT_125945] h the 
systemic design and collection of potentially related adverse events:  
o Hepatic events: hepatic injury or liver dysfunction that leads to an increase from baseline in the serum level of bilirubin.  
o Renal events: renal failure, renal insufficiency, or renal injury that leads to an increase from baseline in serum creatinine.  
o Hematologic/coagulation events: coagulopathy, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis.  
o Changes in serum sodium and potassium  
● Scales Used to Grade Severity of Adverse Events: All AEs will be graded 
in the following manner:  
o Grade 1 (Mild): Events require minimal or no treatment and do not 
interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
o Grade 2 (Moderate): Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern.   Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
o Grade 3 (Severe): Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily 
activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment.   Severe events are usually incapacitating. 
o Grade 4 (Life-threatening): Any adverse drug experience that 
places the participant, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
o Grade 5 (Death)

VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
● Scales Used Attribute Adverse Events : The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_125891]: 
o Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled 
out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study 
agent/intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to 
withdrawal of the study agent/intervention (de -challenge) should 
be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory re -
challenge procedure if necessary.  
o Probably Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The 
clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, oc curs 
within a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study agent/intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawal (de- challenge). Re -challeng e 
information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
o Possibly Related: There is some evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time 
after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence 
of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the 
subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an 
adverse drug event may rate only as “possible” soon after 
discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and 
later be upgraded to probable or certain as appropriate. 
o Unlikely:  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, whose temporal relationship to study agent/intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the 
event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). 
o Not related: The AE is completely independent of study 
agent/intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the 
event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
● Anticipated Adverse Events : Adverse events are not expected from any of 
the study procedures.   We do not expect any serious adverse events due 
to losartan.  
● Recording and Documentation  
o At each contact [CONTACT_1155], personnel must seek information 
as to discomforts or adverse experiences by [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_125892] (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
contagion. Information about AEs to be recorded includes event 
description, time of  onset, investigator assessment of severity, 
relationship to Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event.   All AEs occurring during the 
study period (from time of consent signing to study day 15) must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship to study 
products or procedures unless included on the list of clinical outcomes that may be exempt from adverse outcomes reporting 
as part of the study protocol and outcomes.  Information on all 
identified AEs will be  recorded within 5 days recognition, while 
SAEs will be reported within 24 hours  in the appropriate AE 
module of the case report form (CRF) on Redcap.   
18.3 Data Safety Monitoring: A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been 
convened and includes  4 individuals meeting the key element criteria below, and 
includes a biostatistician with prior clinical trials DSMB experience. The DSMB will follow 
the guidance as outlined in the application and the attached charter unless there is a 
compelling, unanticipated reason to deviate from these rules. Data regarding the primary 
outcome (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be reported to the DSMB continuously, consistent with continuous study monitoring principles. The DSMB may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_125893] , following these guidelines:  
[Patient Safety] A recommendation to suspend, alter the study,  or stop for harm 
would occur if during continuous monitoring there is  strong evidence that the rate 
of IRB -reported SAEs was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the 
placebo group. SAEs (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the primary SAE of interest ) will be 
reported within [ADDRESS_141555] 
formal interim analyses for safety at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, and 50% of enrollment. With a baseline event rate of 15%, this corresponds to formal analyses 
after every ~5 events initially, decreasing to every ~[ADDRESS_141556] additional safety assessments after the 50% assessment, if they feel that additional formal testing is needed.  
The DSMB will operate in accordance with guidelines established by [CONTACT_34033] “Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data 
Monitoring Committee” jointly published by [CONTACT_941] C BER, CDER and CDRH of the FDA 
(https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -information/search- fda-guidance-
documents/establishment -and-operation- clinical- trial-data- monitoring -committees). The 
key elements include:  
1. Expertise and independence: The members must have expertise in the area of study, not be study authors and have no financial conflict of interest. 
2. Members will sign a confidentiality agreement.  
3. It is preferred that the DSMB have a face- to-face initial meeting, but can meet 
by [CONTACT_125946] e frequently.  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
4. All meetings must follow standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
If the DSMB recommends closure of the study, then the DSMB Chair will email the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_32397]. If the trial is stopped for patient safety and a repairable 
caus e of unacceptably high adverse events can be identified, the action must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_125947]. For example, if one additional exclusion criterion is discovered that would account for the 
majority of unexpected events, this new exclusion criterion could be added, and the study could proceed.  
19.[ADDRESS_141557] the Privacy Interests of Participants  
19.1 Protecting Privacy:  Conversations will be held in a private room whenever 
possible. Telephone calls will be performed one on one.  The electronic consent process takes place using a secure RedCAP server that is HIPAA compliant . 
19.2 Access to Participants:  Conduct of the study and determination of both safety and 
efficacy of the intervention requires access of the medical records. All study personnel undergo human subjects protection training and understand and value 
privacy standards set forth by [CONTACT_2373]. Participants enrolled in t he trial are made 
aware during the informed consent procedure that study personnel will be required 
to access this private information for trial conduct, and consent to this access prior 
to agreeing to participate.

personnel who have been specially trained in obtaining informed consent. Our 
team has significant experience in this process, with due consideration of vulnerable patient populations. The subject or LAR will review the eC onsent in 
detail and have the chance to ask questions.  The personnel will then ask the 
subject questions to ensure that they understand the information presented in the 
consent discussion using a teach back method.  The rights and welfare of the 
participants will be protected by [CONTACT_125948]. A copy of the informed consent document will be available electronically  to 
the participants during the consent conversation and a signed copy will be emailed
 
for their records.  The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial (see withdrawal procedures). The eConsent forms are

will not be obtained):  N/A  
MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for outpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE:5APR2020  
 
21.4 Non-English Speaking Participants:  Spanish and Somali speaking persons, who 
represent the vast majority of non -English speaking patients in the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25817], will be included as described above.  
21.5 Participants Who Are Not Yet Adults (infants, children, teenagers under 18 years of 
age):  These patient groups  will be excluded per the study protocol. If logistical and 
scientific concerns can be adequately addressed, we will submit a revised application with an ethical framework, scientific support, and logistical considerations.  
21.6 Cognitively Impaired Adults, or adults with fluctuating or diminished capacity to consents:  The enrollment of these patients will necessarily by [CONTACT_125949]. The identification of patients who lack consent capacity will not be possible in ED patients discharged or in 
patients presenting to drive- through clinics in this study since capacity 
assessments, such as the UBACC or the MacArthur Competence Assessment 
tool, are difficult to conduct over telemedicine or the phone, and methods of 
administering capacity screening tools in these settings have not yet been 
validating. Patients screened in the ED still physically present could be enrolled. To 
establish capacity in this setting, the MacArthu r Competence Assessment tool will 
be administered by [CONTACT_7355]. If the patient lacks capacity, a LAR 
may provide consent for these participants on their behalf.  For adults unable to 
consent, consent will be obtained from a legally authorized representative in the following order of priority consistent with Minnesota State Law: health care agent 
previously assigned via a health care power of attorney, spouse, parents, adult 
children, and then adult siblings. An incapacitated adult who has a court appointed guardian would require permission of the court for enrollment, and these 
participants will be excluded practically from the trial.  
21.7 Adults Unable to Consent: These patients will be evaluated using the same 
process as 21.6 , and may be eligible for consent via an LAR if physically present in 
the ED . 
21.8 Assent and dissent in adults with fluctuating or limited mental capacity:   
● Assent : If patients might have capacity, we use the MacArthur 
Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research. If they do not reach 
the pre- specified threshold for capacity, we seek from an LAR. We do not 
seek further assent, as these patients are frequently intubated, delirious, 
or medically sedated 
● Dissent : However, even if the LAR consents to the trial, if the patient is 
awake and alert, but dissent, we will exclude the patient.

25.1 Resources Available:  It is difficult to estimate how many patients will develop 
COVID -19 in Minneapolis; however, given estimates from other countries it is likely to be 
1000’s if the virus is not cont ained.  
The study PIs and research team will contribute at least 20% of their research time 
towards conducting and completing this study, we will leverage the rich resources of the 
UMN SIREN network hub and HCMC emergency department research infrastructure (of 
note, [CONTACT_125954] is research director at HCMC, as well as associate research director 
at the University of Minnesota). In total across sites, this include >8 FTE of highly trained research nurses, coordinators, and research assistants across sites managed by [CONTACT_22888]-

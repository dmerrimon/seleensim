Background, Aim, & Hy pothesis 
The free gingival graft (FGG) is a commonly used perio dontal  plastic  surgery 
procedure for the augmentation of kerat inized gingiva around teeth and implants. 
The FGG procedure uses a har vesting technique from the palate  that  leaves  an open 
wound  that  heals by [CONTACT_129108], which  can t ake 2 to 4 weeks. Mucogingival 
surgery has been shown to cause  posto perat ive pain 3.5 times  as much pain as 
osseous  surgery and 6 times  as much pain as soft tissue  surgery2. When bone is left 
exposed  it tends to exaggerate  the inadverte nt postsu rgical inflam matory response 
and increase posto perative pain. Wess el and Tatakis1 compared  patient outcomes 
following sube pi[INVESTIGATOR_018] c onnective  tissue  graft (SCTG) and FGG procedures and 
indicated that  FGG was associa ted with a greater incidence of donor  site pain 
compared  to SCTG donor site during the early  posto perat ive perio d. There were 
significa nt differenc es between  early (3-day) and late (3-week) pain levels for FGG 
donor  sites. Pain in the palatal donor  site at 3 days posto perat ively was reported by 
[INVESTIGATOR_101330]:  HSC -DB-15-0658  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/06/2015   50% of SCTG subjects  and 90% of FGG subjects; this difference  was statistically 
significa nt. A previo us study4 found similar  results and at tributed  the poorer patient 
outco mes following FGG to differenc es in donor site harvesting techniques.  In an 8- 
week observational study using a verbal descriptor scale to assess  postoperat ive 
discom fort, Del Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68989].[ADDRESS_1052848] posto perat ive week in  100% of sub jects  trea ted with an FGG 
harvesting technique and in only  50% of subjects  trea ted with a single-incision 
harvesting technique. Add itionally, in a study on [ADDRESS_1052849]-operat ive discom fort. Another  technique utili zes a 
hemostatic  agent such  as Gelfoam®  (absorba ble gelat in compressed sponge)  or 
Surgicel® covered  with a wo und dressing such as PeriAcryl®90 (a cyanoac rylate 
tissue  adhesive).  
A new wound  dressing mat erial, epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594], has shown to give rapid exten ded 
reduction of pain in ca ncer patients suffering  from Oral Mucositis/Stomati tis (may 
be caused  by [CONTACT_767729]). The intended use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] is for the 
man ageme nt of pain and relief  of pain, by [CONTACT_767730] s urface of the 
mouth, soothing  oral lesions  of vario us etiologies. epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] has obtained 501 (k) 
market clearance by  [CONTACT_55257], in June  201 1. epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] is an oromucosal  liquid in a 
multi-dose cont ainer and is without act ive pharmaceutic al ingredients and without 
systemic side effects  demonstrat ed in clinical and pre-clinical studies. epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] is 
inten ded for use in the oral ca vity as far as the pharynx but it is not dangerous to 
swallow.  The oromucosal liquid transfo rms in situ to a bioad hesive oromucosal  gel 
by [CONTACT_767731]. epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] cont ains six ingredients 
glycerol dioleate, soy  phosphatidyl choline  (lecithin), ethano l, propylene glycol, 
polysorbate [ADDRESS_1052850] been reported. epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]® cont ains small amounts of  ethanol (alc ohol), 
less than  100 mg per dose, which  may  cause  a bu rning sens ation when applied to 
sore muc osal surfaces.  epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]® cont ains also small  amounts of  propylene glycol 
which  may  cause  skin irritation and peppermint oil which  may  cause  allergic 
reaction.  epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] should not be used  on patients allergic to any of  the ingredients, 
including peanuts,  soy (soya) or peppermint oil. Currently there are no known 
concerns  of use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] in human pregna ncy or breast-feeding. 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -DB-15-0658  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/06/2015   epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] is contained within an amber  glass bottle with  a manual met ering 
pump filled  with 10 mL of oral liquid. It is applied to the  oral cavity by  [CONTACT_648587]  1 – 3 
times.  Distri buted  to affected  areas  in the mouth and within a few minutes  the liquid 
converts  to a gel a nd the protecti ve film is  formed. It is intended for use 2 – 3 times  
a day or as needed and is normally  intended for cont inuous use for not mo re than 
30 days. 
Oral mucositis in advanced stages, similar  to a FGG donor  site, can be 
extremely  painful, preven ting a patient from eating and even  disrupting the 
patient’s daily function s. The aim of this study will be  to compa re patient-based 
outc omes,  specifically  posto perat ive pain, at the FGG donor  sites, using an 
interventional  parallel -group design, whereby a hemos tatic gauze, Surgicel®, will be 
placed  within all of the palatal donor  sites and covered  with either e pi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] (test) or a 
cyanoacrylate dressing, PeriAcryl®90 (control). The secondary  aim of this  study 
will be  to co mpare gingival healing via measu rement  of the gingi val blood flow at 
the FGG donor  sites by [CONTACT_767732] (LDF)  technique, by [CONTACT_767733].  The hypothesis  for the present study is that patient-based 
outc omes  and gingival blo od flow will be  more favorable for the FGG donor sites 
being covered  by [CONTACT_767734][INVESTIGATOR_119594] compared  to the  contr ol 
dressing. 
 
Study Population and Design 
Forty subjects  will be recruited from the Periodontics  and Den tal Hygiene 
Clinic and the UTDen tists Practic e, located at the UTH ealth  Scho ol of Den tistry in 
Houston, [LOCATION_007], where the study will be  performed. Only subjects  who have already 
formally  agreed to receive a FGG as part of  their overall  perio dontal  treatment  plan 
will be  recruited. Inclu sion criteria  will be  [ADDRESS_1052851] 
at UTH ealth  Scho ol of Den tistry Houston [LOCATION_007],  signed trea tment  plan for a FGG, and 
the ability to provide rese arch informed  conse nt. Exclusion criteria will be  any 
aller gies to any of the ingredients in epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594] including aller gies to peanuts,  soy or 
peppermint oil, smokers, pregna nt or breast feeding women, and inability or 
unwillingness to provide informed  conse nt. As stated above, electi ve surgical 
procedures are not routinely performed  on pregnant or lactat ing women and are 
postponed until after  childbirth  and or completion of lactat ion.  Exit c riteria  will be 
unwillingness or inability to cont inue in the study and non-compliance with study 
procedures and appointmen ts. The Institutional  Review  Board of The University  of 
[LOCATION_007]  will approve the study protoco l, quest ionn aires and informed  conse nt form. 
The study will be  of an interventional  parallel -group design. A computer 
generat ed randomization scheme  will ass ign the subjects  to one  of the two 
trea tment  groups.  All subjects  will ha ve the gingival grafting  procedure, the free 
gingival graft, performed  at sites lacking attached  kerat inized gingival t issues.  The 
palatal donor  site in subjects  assigned to the  control group will receive the 
hemostatic  agen t, Surgicel®, covered  by [CONTACT_767735], PeriAcryl®90. 
The palatal donor  site in the subjects  assigned  to the  test group will receive the 
hemostatic  agen t, Surgicel®, covered  by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_119594]®. Additionally, the subjects  in the 
test group will be gi ven the remai nder of the bottle of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]® to ta ke home with  
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -DB-15-0658  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/06/2015   instructions  for self-application as needed 3 times  daily for pain reli ef. A sufficient 
supply of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]® will be  provided to the  test sub jects  for the study duration. 
The total duration of the study per subject will be  21 days from the day of the 
surgical procedure. The primary  outcome  of postoperat ive pain will be  determined 
by [CONTACT_767736] a Visual  Analog 
Scale Form/Quest ionn aire and the number  of analgesic pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] t aken e ach day at 1, 2, 
3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days posto perat ively. The Visual  Analog  Scale Form/ 
Questionnaire for post-operat ive days 1, 2, [ADDRESS_1052852]’s place of  residence, while the Visual  Analog  Scale Form/Quest ionn aire for 
days 3, 7, [ADDRESS_1052853]’s post-operat ive appointments 
at the dental  clini c. The Visual  Analog  Scale Form/Quest ionn aire will eval uate the 
subjects’ pos toperat ive pain usi ng a visual an alog scale ( VAS) scores from 1 to 10, 
with 1 indicating min imal pain and 10 indicating seve re pain. If no pain is present, a 
score of 0 will be  given.  The levels of posto perat ive pain will be classif ied as none to 
min imum if the sco re is “0 to 3,” moderate  for “4 to 6,” and seve re for  “7 to 10.” None 
to minimal  pain will mean little or  no discom fort; moderate is any pain that  bothe rs 
the subject and mildly affects  normal function;  and seve re will be considered  any 
pain that will not be tolerat ed and may  even  disrupt the sub ject’s daily functions.  
One of  the secondary  outco mes, gingival blood  flow, will be  determined with 
the laser  Doppler flowmetry  (LDF) technique to measu re the blood perfusion  of the 
FGG donor  site and as well as  the contralateral side of the palate, as a positive 
contr ol, at baseline prior to su rgery, imme diately after  harvesting of the FGG from 
donor  site, and on post-operat ive days 3, 7, [ADDRESS_1052854], and is captured by [CONTACT_767737]. The light signals are 
then  converted  into electric  signals a nd the resulting  photo current is processed  to 
provide a recording of the blood flow.19 The term used to descr ibe blood flow is flux 
– a quanti ty proportional to the average speed of the blood cells and  their 
conce ntration. This is expressed in arbitra ry perfusion  units (PU),  which  are linearly 
related to flux. The PeriFlux System 5000 (Laser Doppler Blood Perfusion Monitoring 
and tcpO2/tcpCO 2) along  with the Laser Doppler Probes for the PeriFlux 
System [ADDRESS_1052855] is based on the principle that if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_767720], the H2O2 diffuses  into the conn ective tissue;  the enzyme catalase acts 
on H2O2 to release water and oxygen: this is clinically  shown by [CONTACT_767738]. 3% H2O2 will be  applied to the  FGG donor  site with a syringe 
and the appearance of bubbles  will be  recorded as a dichoto mous variable (yes/no) 
at the post-operat ive days 3, 7, 14, and [ADDRESS_1052856]’s  FGG donor  site has

Data and Safe ty Monitoring 
Subjects will be i nformed  that  if they  experie nce any adverse  even ts with the 
use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594], that  they  should discon tinue the use of the product immediately. 
Depending on the seve rity of the adverse  event  the patient will be a dvised to either 
call [ADDRESS_1052857]. Jennifer D. James  to report the event. An Unanticipated Problems 
Tracking Log Form will be used  to report adverse events to report them to CPHS. 
Any a dverse  event  will then  be immediately reported to Cam urus AB, the 
manu factu re of epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]. 
An Unanticipated Problems  Tracking Log Form will be  used  to record and 
report any a dverse  events that  are unexpecte d, related and put the  subjects  or 
othe rs at harm, meet the definition of Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks  to 
Subjects  or Others  and will be  reported to the  Committee for the Protection  of 
Human Subjects. 
 
Surgical Proced ures & Postoperative Care 
As stated above, perio dontal  residents under the direct  supervision of 
perio dontal  faculty will perform the FGG  procedure in all subjects. The FGG 
procedure will be  performed  following the surgical techn ique of Sullivan and 
Atkins15,[ADDRESS_1052858] atic gauze, Surgicel®, covered  by a cyanoacr ylate dressing, 
PeriAcryl®90, at the donor site while the subjects in the test group will receive the 
same  brand of hem ostatic gauze, Surgicel, but co vered  with epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]®. Subjects  in 
the test group will be gi ven the remai nder of the bottle of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_119594]® with instructions 
for home application up to [ADDRESS_1052859]-operat ive weeks.  Subjects  will be  provided with a prescri ption for ibuprofen 
(600 mg) to ta ke as needed for analgesia, unle ss contrai ndicated. Acetaminophen 
with 30mg of codeine will be  prescri bed to sub jects  unable to  ingest  ibuprofen. 
The LDF measu reme nts in the FGG donor  site and on the contralateral  side of 
the palate  will be  recorded in four sites. A clear  acrylic stent will be  fabricated for 
each subject from individual s ubjects’ dental casts.  Holes will be  made in the stent 
in four locations  on each the right and left si des of the palate.  One s ite located 
centrall y, one close to the mes ial, one close to the distal and one close to the api[INVESTIGATOR_767721]. The LDF 
measu reme nt will be performed  at baseline prior to su rgery, imme diately after  
harvesting of the FGG donor  site, and on post-operat ive days 3, 7, 14 and 21. The 
LDF measu reme nts will be performed  with the tip of the fibre optic probe inserted 
into the holes of the individual acrylic stent.20 The LDF probe will be  placed  at a

significa nce level for rejection  of the null h ypothesis  will be  set at  = 0.05. 
All LDF recordings, which may  be impaired  by [CONTACT_767739], will be  excluded. An average of the 2-minute period  of each 
individual recording will be calc ulated. Changes  of blood flux values in the FGG 
donor  site will be  expressed as the difference  (PU) between  the PU value  at a 
specific site at a specific observation time point  (PUt) and the individual baseline 
value  of the same site (PU0):PUt – PU0. 
Desc riptive statistics will be  performed  using the SPSS statistical software. 
The PU values  in the FGG donor  site will be a nalyzed using the  general linear 
model (GLM) univaria te test, after  verificat ion of the assumptions of homogeneity of 
varia nce and normality  of the residual  distribution. The observation time and point  
and the position (mesial, center, distal and api[INVESTIGATOR_767724]) will be  
modeled  as fixed  facto rs and the patient as a random factor  with the PU as the 
dependent variable. The Dune tt two-sided t-test will be use d, in order to evaluate  
the differenc es between  baseline and subs equent time points and between different  
positions in the FGG donor  site during the overall observational perio d. Data  will be 
presented as mean SE. Statistical significance  will be  acce pted at p<0.[ADDRESS_1052878]-hoc tests  using Bon ferroni- 
corrected  Fisher’s e xact test (2-tailed). 
Based  on a sam ple size of n = 40 (20 per group), a repeated measu res 
analysis will have 80% power to detect an effect size of f = .57. For a sample  size of n 
= 30 (15 per group), the  same analysis will have 80% power to detect an effect size 
of f = .67, while a sam ple size of n = 20 (10 per group)  will have 80% power to 
detect an effect size of f = .83. All of these  effect si zes are class ified as large effects  
by [CONTACT_30822]’s guidelines (1988), or  large differences in the change in pain score 
between the two groups22.

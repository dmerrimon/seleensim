Study Design :  This is a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open -label, basket trial to evaluate the safety of 
talimogene laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver tumors alone and in combination with 
systemic  IV administration of pembrolizumab, in subjects with non -HCC liver metastases from 
BC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), melanoma, NSCLC, RCC in Part 1 Group A, and 
subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 1 Group B (viral hepatitis is only 
applicable in combination setting), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratumoral 
talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic pembrolizumab in subjects with 
advanced TNBC, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, CRC, CSCC, and BCC in Part 2 
Group A and subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 2 Group B.  The study 
consists of 2 parts and 2 groups, and Part 2 includes 2 stages.  
The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety of intrahepatic injection of talimogene 
laherparepvec into liver tumors alone and in combination with systemically admini stered 
pembrolizumab for the non -HCC (Group A) and HCC (Group B [with and without viral hepatitis; 
viral hepatitis is only applicable in combination setting]) cohorts separately.  NOTE :  as of 
Protocol  Amendment  6 [dated 26 October 2021], intrahepatic inje ctions of talimogene 
laherparepvec and liver biopsies are no longer performed in this study .  In the monotherapy 
cohorts (Cohorts  1-4), the safety of administering increasing concentration   
(107 plaque forming unit [PFU]/mL or 108 PFU/mL) and volumes (maximum up to 4 or 8 mL) of 
talimogene laherparepvec will be determined using a standard 3   [ADDRESS_47131] dose of talimogene laherparepvec in all cohorts is always 106 PFU/mL.  Cohort 1 of 
Group B will be initiated only after safety has been established in Cohort 1 of Group A.  
Combination cohorts (Cohorts  5 and 6) in Part 1 will determine the safety of administering 
intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec at 107 PFU/mL or 108 PFU/mL in sequentia l 
cohorts (volume up to 4 mL for both doses) in combination with systemic IV administration of

pembrolizumab (200  mg).  A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) up -and-down design will 
be used to determine safety in the combination cohorts.   
Once the MTC is determined from Cohorts 5 and 6, Part  2 will open to evaluate efficacy and 
safety of the combination treatment in the respective tumor types (5 non -HCC tumor types in 
Group A and HCC tumor type in two cohorts [with and without viral hepatitis] i n Group B).  Timing 
of opening Part 2 for the non -HCC (Group A) and HCC (Group B) groups will be based on when 
the MTC for talimogene laherparepvec (from the combination cohorts) is determined for the 
respective Groups.  Talimogene laherparepvec will be us ed at a maximum volume of 8 mL 
(established from monotherapy Cohort  3 in Part 1).  If the safety of administering up to [ADDRESS_47132] concentration or 
volume escalation is allowed.

Part 2 consists of 2 -stage design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ta limogene laherparepvec 
in combination with systemic pembrolizumab.  Efficacy and safety will be evaluated in each of the 
5 non -HCC tumor types from Group A separately.  Similarly, the efficacy and safety of the 
combination treatment will be determined for Group B HCC  subjects with and without viral 
hepatitis.  The primary analysis of efficacy will include subjects that receive any volume of 
talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab.  In Stage 1 of Part 2, enrollment into a tumor type 
(arm) will stop for ef ficacy analysis when 10  subjects with that tumor type are enrolled.    If 
efficacy for that tumor type is not futile, Stage  2 can open where an additional 11  subjects can be 
enrolled for that tumor type arm.  The Dose Level Review Team  (DLRT ) will consider  prospective 
guidelines to monitor safety in Part  2 separately by [CONTACT_44835], if introduced, talimogene 
laherparepvec total volumes  4 mL within Group A and Group B.   
For details on study design, please refer to the Study Design and Treatment Schema  and 
Section  3.1. 
Sample Size:  Total number of subjects enrolled  in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study is 127 subjects 
(74 subjects in Part 1; 53 subjects in Part 2).  The Part [ADDRESS_47133] one dose of talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab; therefore,

Statistical Considerations:  
The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_9084]/group (non -HCC and HCC), in the overall population and by 
[CONTACT_44847], if applicable.  Descriptive statistic s will be provided for demographic, safety, efficacy, 
and biomarkers as appropriate.  Formal analysis will be performed on the primary endpoints in 
Part 2.  
For Part 1, the DLT analysis set will be used to summarize the subject incidence of DLT as 
defined i n Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  For talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy, safety will be assessed 
for non -HCC and HCC groups based on the 3   3 design.  For the combination of talimogene 
laherparepvec with pembrolizumab, safety will be assessed for non -HCC and HCC groups based 
on the mTPI [CONTACT_25764] -and-down design.  The DLRT will consider prospective guidelines in the DLRT 
Charter to monitor safety in Part  2 separately by [CONTACT_44835], if intro duced, talimogene 
laherparepvec total volumes  4 mL within Group A and Group B as discussed in Section  10.  If 
the concentration is reduced in Part 2 for a tumor type, then the sample size considerations for 
the 2 -stage futility and efficacy analyses of that tumor type will include only subjects treated in 
Part 1 and 2 at the reduced concentration.  
Objective response rate, BOR, DRR, DOR, response in injected and uninjected lesion s, DCR, 
PFS, and OS will be summarized separately for non -HCC and HCC tumors in monotherapy and 
combination  cohorts.  Objective response rate, DRR, and DCR will be summarized with an 
associated 95  CI.   
For Part 2, the efficacy analysis will be conducted using the full analysis set from  Part 2, unless 
otherwise specified.  The primary analysis of efficacy will include subjects that receive any 
volume of talimogene laherparepvec (in monotherapy cohorts) or any volume of talimogene 
laherparepvec and pembroli zumab (in combination cohorts).  The [ADDRESS_47146].  The null hypothesis of a 10  ORR for a given 
tumor type that continued to Stage [ADDRESS_47147] binomial 95  CI for the ORR i s 
above 10  (Atkinson and Brown, 1985).  
Best overall response, DRR, DOR, response in injected and uninjected lesions, DCR, PFS, and 
OS will be summarized by [CONTACT_44834] (hormone receptor positive BC, TNBC, CSCC, 
CRC, BCC, and HCC with and withou t viral hepatitis ).  Objective response rate, DRR, and DCR 
will be summarized with an associated 95  CI.  Duration of response among responders, PFS 
and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
For both Part 1 and Part 2, the safety analysis set  will be used for all safety analyses.  The safety 
analyses will include the incidence of treatment -emergent and treatment -related adverse events 
(all adverse events,   grade [ADDRESS_47148]).  The qPCR analysis result of talimogene 
laherparepvec DNA in swab samples taken from cold sore, vesicles, and other lesions suspected 
to be herpetic in origin (if any) will be summarized.  Interim safety analyses will be pe rformed for 
evaluation of DLT for Parts [ADDRESS_47149] ed.  For a full description of statistical 
analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

1.3 Exploratory  
The exploratory objectives of the study are as follows:  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Metastatic Liver Tumors  
In addition to being the organ of origin for HCC, the liv er is one of the major sites of 
metastasis for many tumor types.  In autopsy studies, the incidence of liver metastases 
was 48.6 to 61.1  for breast cancer, 33.4 to 40  for lung cancer, 34.3 to 44.5  for 
gastric cancer, 65.3  for colon cancer, 33.3 to 47.1  for rectal cancer, 16 to 27  for 
kidney cancer (Abrams et al, 1950), and 58.3  for melanoma (Patel et al, 1978).  
Metastasectomy is an option for limited CRC  liver metastases, but generally systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44762].  Traditionally, melanoma and RCC  are thought to 
be the most sensitive tumor types to immunotherapy, but recent advances in immune 
checkpoint blockade therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44763] i mmunotherapy in other tumor 
types as well (eg, NSCLC) (Nguyen et al, 2014).  
Localized HCC is primarily treated by [CONTACT_44850], transplant or locally ablative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Resection of HCC is generally reserved for those patients with limited disease.  Other 
localized therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44764], transarterial

Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date:  [ADDRESS_47176] ablation, cryoablation, or percutaneous ethanol injection and are more 
comm only used in the setting of unresectable HCC but may also be used in the setting 
of liver metastases.  The currently FDA -approved systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44765] -kinase inhibitors sorafenib (for treatment 
unresectable HCC) (Llovet et al, 2008), lenvatinib (for first line treatment of unresectable 
HCC) (Kudo et al, 2018) and regorafenib (for  those previously treated with sorafenib) 
(Bruix et al, 2017), and cabozantinib (for those previously treated with sora fenib) (Abou -
Alfa et al, 2018) and accelerated approval for the PD -1 inhibitors nivolumab (for those 
previously treated with sorafenib)  
(El-Khoueiry, et al, 2017) and pembrolizumab (for those previously treated with 
sorafenib) (Zhu et al, 2018) and the mo noclonal antibody ramicirumab (for patients with 
alpha fetal protein 400 ng/ml who were previously treated with sorafenib) (Zhu, et al, 
2019).  Of note, the phase [ADDRESS_47177] supportive care arm, they 
did not reach statistical significance (Finn, et al, 2019).  
Even with the currently available treatment options, unresectable HCC and metastases 
of other solid tumors to the liver generally portend a poor pr ognosis, and thus, new 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44766].

virus with a disrupted thymidine kinase (tk) gene to improve selectivity for canc er and 
insertions of human granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) for 
immune stimulation and -galactosidase for assessment of replication.  It was 
administered intratumorally (IT) in a phase 1 trial to 14 subjects with primary HCC or 
non-HCC in a dose escalation study (Park et al, 2008).  DLT occurred at the highest 
dose of 3 x 109 plaque forming unit (PFU) with grade [ADDRESS_47179] by [CONTACT_44851] 3 anorexia and 
abdo minal pain, which was a serious adverse event.  Thus, 109 PFU was determined as 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  No treatment -related deaths occurred.  All subjects

(PRs) (lung SCC, HCC, and melanoma), and 6 had stable disease (SD) by [CONTACT_44852] (RECIST).  By [CONTACT_44853], an additional

dose -finding phase 2 study, 30 subjects with advanced HCC were randomized to either 
108 or 109 PFU JX -594 injected IT into up to five HCC tumors on days 1, 15, and 29  
(Heo et al, 2 013).  Treatment was generally well tolerated at both doses, and there were 
no treatment -related deaths.  There was one treatment -related serious adverse event of 
nausea and vomiting at the [ADDRESS_47182] 12 to 24 hours after treatment.  The only grade 3 event was 
pyrexia which occurred in 19  of subjects treated at the 109 PFU dose and one grade  4 
event of lymphopenia occurred at the 109 PFU dose.  The trial was stopped early due to 
significant survival benefit favoring the higher -dose group  (14.1  months vs 6.7 months) 
with median OS at 9.[ADDRESS_47183] or modified Choi responses between the  
higher and lower dose (7  vs 23 and 57 vs 67, respectively).  A subsequent phase 
2b study evaluating JX -594 for 6 treatments on days 1 (IV), 8 (IT), 22 (IT), and weeks 6 
(IT), 12 (IT), 18 (IT) vs best supportive care in [ADDRESS_47184] s with 
HCC refractory or intolerant to sorafenib did not meet its primary endpoint of OS 
(Transgene, 2013).  However, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] [ADDRESS_47185] line setting for approximately 600  subjects with HCC is

Date:  [ADDRESS_47187] Background  
Talimogene laherparepvec is an in tralesionally delivered oncolytic immunotherapy 
comprised of a genetically engineered HSV -1 that selectively replicates in tumors 
(Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s Brochure  [IB]).  The neurovirulence factor 
ICP34.[ADDRESS_47188] a 
number of different solid tumor types including BC, CRC, prostat e cancer, glioblastoma, 
hypopharyngeal SCC, and melanoma cell lines (Liu  et al, 2003).  The role of ICP47 is to 
block antigen presentation to major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) I molecules 
by [CONTACT_44854] 1 and 2.  Deletion of 
ICP47 allows for improved antigen presentation by [CONTACT_44855]11 gene, which promotes virus growth in cancer cells 
without decreasing tumor selectivity.  
Additionally, the virus  contains the coding sequence for human GM -CSF, a pleiotropic 
cytokine involved in the stimulation of cellular immune responses by [CONTACT_44856] (Demir et al, 2003; Lonial, 2004; 
Conti and Gessani, 2008).  Dendritic cells have the capacity to capture antigens, migrate 
in response to chemotactic stimuli, and induce proliferative responses and Th1  cytokine 
production in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 ) and CD8  T-lymphocytes (Hart, 1997; 
Ikeda et al, 2004;  Paul,  2007).  These Th1 -type cytokines have the capacity to produce 
proinflammatory responses, eradicate tumors, and perpetuate autoimmune responses 
(Nishimura  et al, 2000; Ikeda et al, 2004; Knutson and Disis, 2005).  This immune 
component of talimogene laherparepvec is thought to help mediate systemic responses 
beyond the injected tumors.

Talimogene laherparepvec has clinical efficacy in patients with regionally and distantly 
metastatic melanoma (Talimogene Laherparepvec IB).  In the melanoma setting, 
talimogene laherparepvec has been administered into cutaneous or subcutaneous 
lesions or lymph nodes accessible by [CONTACT_2207] (US) but not yet into visceral lesions.  
The largest study to evaluate the activity of talimogene laherparepvec in melanoma was 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_44767] (Study 20110263).  In this open -label, phase  3 study, 436 
subjects with stages lllB to IV unresectable melanoma were randomized 2:1 to 
intralesional talimogene laherparepvec or subcutaneous GM -CSF.  Treatment was 
administered until comp lete response (CR), clinically significant disease progression, 
intolerable side effects, 12 months of therapy without an objective response, or 
withdrawal of consent).  The primary endpoint of the OPTiM study was DRR, defined as 
the rate of subjects with an objective response by [CONTACT_9559] (CR or PR) lasting 
continuously for 6 months and starting any time within 12 months of initiating therapy.  
Secondary endpoints included OS, BOR, modified PFS, changes in tumor burden and 
safety.  
Primary analysis of the OPTiM study showed a statistically significant difference 
between the DRR among subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec (16 ; 95 
confidence interval [CI]: 12 , 21) versus those treated with GM -CSF (2; 95 CI: 0, 
5, p-value  0.0001).  Overa ll response rate was 26.4  (CR 10.8) for talimogene 
laherparepvec vs 5.7  (CR 0.7) for GM -CSF (p -value  0.0001 descriptive).  Median 
OS among subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec was 23.[ADDRESS_47189] ratio (HR) of 0.79 and 
p-value of 0.051 (Andtbacka et al, 2013; Kaufman et al, 2014).  
In a lesion level analysis, 64  and 47 of injected lesions, 34  and 22 of uninjected 
non-visceral lesions, and 15  and 9 of uninjected visceral lesions regressed  50 
and 100, respectively, demonstrating the systemic effect of talimogene laherparepvec 
beyond injected lesions (Andtbacka et al, 2014).  
The most common side effects in the OPTiM study were chills (talimogene 
laherparepvec , 49; GM -CSF, 9), pyrexia (43 ; 9), injection -site pain (28 ; 6), 
nausea (36 ; 20), influenza -like illness (30 ; 15), and fatigue (50 ; 36).  
Grade   3 adverse events occurred in 36  of subjects receiving talimogene 
laherparepvec and 21 of subjects receiving GM -CSF.  The only grade 3/4 adverse 
events occurring in  5 subjects was cellulitis (talimogene laherparepvec, n 6 [2.1];

eight were attributable t o disease progression.  The remaining two fatal adverse events 
(sepsis in the setting of salmonella infection; myocardial infarction) were not considered 
treatment -related per investigator (Andtbacka et al, 2013).  
The injection of talimogene laherparepvec into visceral tumors has been studied in the

therapy or could not receive/refused alternative therapy (Chang et al, 2012).  There were 
17 subjects who received endoscopic US guided injections into their pancreatic tumors 
at either 1 dose of 104 PFU/mL followed by 2 doses of 105 PFU/mL every 3 weeks 
(Q3W; Cohort 1, n 3), 1 dose of 105 PFU/mL followed by 2 doses of 106 PFU/mL Q3W  
(Cohort 2, n 4), or 1 dose of 106 PFU/mL followed by 2 doses of 107 PFU/mL Q3W 
(Cohort 3, n 10).  A fourth dose schedule of 106 PFU/mL followed by 2  doses of 
108 PFU/mL Q3W was planned but not opened because the study was terminated early 
due to a business decision.  The maximal volume th at could be administered was 4  mL. 
The primary analysis of efficacy was an assessment of the change from baseline in the 
diameter of injected tumors.  Two of the 4 subjects in Cohort 3 with postdose 
computed  tomography  (CT) scans achieved substantial size reductions ( -36 and -33) 
in injected tumors.  No subjects in the lower dose cohorts (n  2 evaluable subjects in 
each cohort) showed clinically relevant size reductions of the injected tumors, 
suggesting a dose trend for response of injected tumors.  Thr ee subjects also showed 
decreases in the diameters of 1 or more uninjected tumors (in the liver, pancreas, 
kidney, and chest) at any point in the study, and [ADDRESS_47191] 
version 1.0, no subjects achieved an overall CR or PR; 3 subjects (Cohorts 1, 1, and 3) 
had an assessment of overall SD at 1 or more time points.  
Eight subjects (47 ) had at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event considered 
related to talimogene laherparepvec.  Treatment -related adverse events included 
pyrexia in 3 subjects; abdominal pain, ascites, influenza -like illness, and dehydration in 
[ADDRESS_47192] s; and constipation, vomiting, chills, pain, headache, weight decrease, and 
diarrhea in [ADDRESS_47193] each.  Grade 3 treatment -related adverse events included 
abdominal pain (12 ), ascites (12 ), and dehydration (6 ); all occurred in Cohort 3.

CD8 T cells and the ratio of CD8  effector  T cells/FoxP3  regulatory T cells seem to 
correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors  
(Chang et al, 2014; Kim  et al, 2013; Preston et al, 2013; Mathai et al, 2012;  
Yoon et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2011; Kirk, 2010; Nosho et  al, 2010).  
The programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway 
hijacked by [CONTACT_44857] (Pedoeem et al, 2014).  The normal 
function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) 
superfamily member related to CD28 and cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte -associated protein 4 
(CTLA -4), which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structures of murine PD -[ADDRESS_47198]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

(Zhang et al, 2004) and in complex with its ligands were first resolved  
(Lázár -Molnár  et al, 2008; Lin  et al, 2008), and more recently the nuclear magnetic 
resonance -based structure of the human PD -1 extracellular region and analyses of its 
interactions with its ligands were also reported (Cheng et al, 2013).  PD -1 and family 
members are t ype I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (IgV) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the 
binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2  tyrosine -based 
signali ng motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T  cell stimulation, PD -1 
recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its 
cytoplasmic tail, lea ding to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules, such as cluster 
of differentiation 3 -zeta (CD3), protein kinase C -theta (PKCθ), and z eta-chain -
associated protein kinase  70 (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T cell signaling 
cascade (Sheppard et a l, 2004).  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_47199] from that of CTLA -4 (Ott et al, 2013).  PD -1 was 
shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4  and CD8 
T cells, B cells, T  regs and Natural Killer cells (Yao and Chen, 2014).  Expression has 
also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -CD8- (double negative) T cells 
(Nishimura et al, 1996), as well as subsets of macrophages (Huang et al, 2009) and 
dendritic cells (Pena -Cruz et al, 2010).  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types (Keir  et al, 2008).  
PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, most notably on 
vascular endothelium, w hereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on  
antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments  
(Keir et al, 2008).  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both  
IgV- and immunoglobulin cons tant-type (IgC) -like domains in the extracellular region and 
short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -1 ligand 
to PD -1 inhibits T cell activation triggered through the T cell receptor.  PD -L2 is thought 
to control imm une T cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to 
dampen unwarranted T cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs 
express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express 
abundant levels of this T cell inhibitor (Taube et al, 2012; Karim et al, 2009), which, via 
its interaction with the PD -1 receptor on tumor -specific T cells, plays a critical role in 
immune evasion by [CONTACT_15198] (Sanmamed and Chen, 2014).  As a consequence, the

PD-1/PD -L1 pathway is a n attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer  
(Topalian et al, 2012).  
2.4.[ADDRESS_47200] shown that administration of antibodies 
blocking PD -1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specifi c CD8 T cells and 
ultimately leads to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
treatment modalities (Spranger et al, 2014; Curran  et al, 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_44768] -Thomas et al, 2010; 
Weber, 2010; Hirano et al, 2005; Blank  et al, 2004; Strom e et al, 2003).  Anti -mouse  
PD-[ADDRESS_47201] demonstrated antitumor responses in 
models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid 
leukemia and colorectal carcinoma (Curran et al, 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_44768] -Thomas e t al, 2010; 
Zhang  et al, 2009; Nomi et  al, 2007; Strome et al, 2003).  In such studies, tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8  T cells and increased IFNg, granzyme B and perforin expression 
were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity  of PD -1 
checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in 
vivo (Curran et al, 2010).  Experiments have confirmed the in vivo  efficacy of anti -mouse 
PD-1 antibody as a monotherapy, as well as in combination wit h chemotherapy, in 
syngeneic mouse tumor models (see the IB).  
2.4.3  Pembrolizumab Background and Clinical Trials  
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) with high specificity of binding to the PD -1 receptor, thus in hibiting its interaction 
with PD -L1 and PD -L2.  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high 
affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1.  Pembrolizumab has an 
acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development a s an IV 
immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  Keytruda  (pembrolizumab) is indicated for 
the treatment of patients across a number of indications.  For more details on specific 
indications refer to the IB (Pembrolizumab IB). 
2.4.4  Rationale for Pembrolizumab  Dose Selection  
The dose of pembrolizumab planned to be studied in this trial is 200 mg Q3W.  The dose 
recently approved in the [LOCATION_002] and several other countries for treatment of 
melanoma subjects is 2 mg/kg Q3W.  Information on the rationale for s electing [ADDRESS_47202]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date:  26 October 2021  Page 38 of 196 
CONFIDENTIAL    
administered as monotherapy, the dose escalation por tion of this trial evaluated 3 dose 
levels, 1, 3, and 10  mg/kg, administered every 2  weeks (Q2W) and dose expansion 
cohorts evaluated 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors.  All dose levels were well tolerated and no DLTs were  observed.  This  
first-in-human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels.  No MTD has been 
identified.  In addition, 2  randomized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab at a dose of 2  mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed, and 
1 randomized cohort evaluating 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W has also been 
completed.  The clinical efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of important 
differ ences in efficacy or safety profile across doses.  
An integrated body of evidence suggests that 200 mg Q3W is expected to provide 
similar response to 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10  mg/kg Q2W.  Previously, a 
flat pembrolizumab exposure -response relationsh ip for efficacy and safety has been 
found in subjects with melanoma in the range of doses between 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg.  
Exposures for 200 mg Q3W are expected to lie within this range and will be close to 
those obtained with 2 mg/kg Q3W dose.  
A population PK model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other 
patient covariates on exposure, has been developed.  The PK profile of pembrolizumab 
is consistent with that of other humanized mAbs, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a low clearance 
and a limited vo lume of distribution.  The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed 
dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose and 
importantly will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range 
established in m elanoma as associated with maximal clinical response.  
Pharmacokinetic properties of pembrolizumab, and specifically the weight -dependency 
in clearance and volume of distribution are consistent with no meaningful advantage to 
weight -based dosing relative t o fixed dosing.  
In translating to other tumor indications, similarly flat exposure -response relationships for 
efficacy and safety as observed in subjects with melanoma can be expected, as the  
anti-tumor effect of pembrolizumab is driven through immune system activation rather 
than through a direct interaction with tumor cells, rendering it independent of the specific 
tumor type.  In addition, available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCL C, and 
other tumor types support a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at

2.5.1  Rationale for Combination Therapy of Talimogene Laherparepvec 
and Pembrolizumab  
Talimogene laherparepvec and PD -1 blockade likely play complementary roles in 
regulating adaptive immunity.  Talimogene laherparepvec likely augments dendritic 
cell-mediated tumor antigen presentation through local expression of GM -CSF 
(Kaufman  et al, 2010) and local antigen release by [CONTACT_44858].  Pem brolizumab 
prevents T  cell exhaustion in peripheral tissues.  The combination of an agent that 
increases tumor -specific immune activation with one that blocks inhibitory T  cell 
checkpoints could produce greater antitumor activity than either agent alone.  
The combination of talimogene laherparepvec with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], an immune checkpoint 
inhibitor, for the treatment of subjects with unresected stage IIIB -IV melanoma is 
currently being evaluated in the ongoing 20110264 phase 1b/2 study.  Talimogene 
laherparepve c was administered initially with maximum volume of 4  mL at 106 PFU/mL.  
The subsequent doses were administered with maximum volume of 4  mL at 108 
PFU/mL.  The phase 1b portion of this study enrolled 19  treatment naïve patients of 
whom 18 were treated with  the combination of both talimogene laherparepvec and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Puzanov et al, 2014).  One subject withdrew consent after 1  dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec.  There were no reported DLT during the DLT evaluation 
period (the [ADDRESS_47206] ad ministration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The most common 
adverse events were chills, fatigue, and pyrexia occurring in 11 subjects (58 ) each.  
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of any kind occurred in 6 subjects (32 ).  The only grade [ADDRESS_47207] not been seen previously with either ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44770].  Two subjects (11 ) experienced possible immune -related 
grade [ADDRESS_47208] experienced 
grade 4 amylase and lipase elevations which were at tributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  These 
grade 3/4 adverse event rates and possible immune -related adverse event are 
consistent with what has been reported with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165] (Hodi et al, 2010).  One

and DRR 44  by [CONTACT_44859] -related response criteria (irRC) (Puzano v et al, 2015).  
Median PFS was not yet reached with 50  of patients still without progression at  
18 months.  Median OS was not yet reached with 67  of patients still alive at 
18 months.  Median time to response was 4.1 months, and median duration of trea tment 
was 13.3 weeks.  Phase 2 of the study is currently ongoing.  An interim analysis of the 
phase 2 portion of the study which was performed when 82  patients had  48 weeks of 
follow up was reported (Chesney et al, 2016).  One -hundred and seventy -three  patients 
were randomized:  88 in the talimogene laherparepvec  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44771] 85 in the 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772].  Characteristics for all patients were similar:  54  stage IIIB -IVM1a, 
45 IVM1b/c.  Median follow -up time for 82  patients was 61.2  weeks (range:  0 .14 to 
113.9).  Confirmed ORR was 35.7  in the combination arm and 17.5  in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44773] 2.6 (95  CI:  0.9 to 7.3).  Unconfirmed ORR was 
50 in the combination arm and 27.5  in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772].  Safety data in the 
analysis were as expected based on the phase 1b data; of 165 patients in the safety set 
(85 in the combination arm and 80 in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]), the incidences of grade  3/4 
treatment related adverse events were similar in both arms (total of 20  in the 
combination arm and 19  in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]) with the exception of diarrhea (4  in 
combination arm vs 0  in ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]) and colitis (4  in combination arm vs 8  in 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]).  A grade 5 autoimmune hepatitis occurred in the combination arm 
which wa s attributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44774].  
In Study 20110265, a phase 1b/3, multicenter trial of talimogene laherparepvec in 
combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of unresectable stage IIIB to IVM1c 
melanoma, an interim analysis for efficacy o f the phase 1b portion of the study was done 
following minimum of 24 weeks follow -up (data cutoff 09  October  2015).  Talimogene 
laherparepvec was administered initially with maximum volume of 4 mL at 106 PFU/mL.  
The subsequent doses were administered with  maximum volume of 4  mL at 108 
PFU/mL.  The confirmed overall response rate was 47  (CR rate, 14 ) with a DCR of

fever (52), chills (48 ), and diarrhea (43 ).  There were no unexpected adverse 
events attributable to the combination therapy that have not been seen previously with 
either pembrolizumab or talimogene laherparepvec individually.  All patients had  1

(pneumonitis).  Talimogene laherparepvec -related serious adverse events occurred in 2 
(10) subjects which included grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and grade 3 aseptic 
meningitis.  Pembrolizumab -related serious adverse even ts occurred in 4 (19 ) subjects 
which included grade  3 autoimmune hepatitis, grade 1 cytokine release syndrome, grade 
3 aseptic meningitis, and grade 4 pneumonitis.  The confirmed ORR was 57  (CR rate 
24) with a median time to response of 17 weeks.  Uncon firmed response rate was 
66.7 with a CR rate of 28 .  The DCR was 71 .  Median PFS was not reached with 
71 of patients being progression free at 6 months.  Talimogene laherparepvec and 
pembrolizumab could be administered at full doses with no unexpected toxicity, and was 
associated with clinical benefits as assessed by [CONTACT_44860].  Phase  3 portion of 
the study was completed 11 March 2021 ( IB; Gogas et  al, 2021) .   
This phase 1b/2, multicenter study is intended to provide confirmation that a regimen of 
an oncolytic immunotherapy (intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec) and an 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) is safe and tolerable, and that the 
combination treatment might enhance the clinical efficacy shown with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 
mAbs in subjects with primary HCC and non - HCC .  Given that subjects with HCC may 
have underlying liver dysfunction compared to subjects with non -HCC primary tumors 
with liver metastases, this study will determine the feasibility and safety of the initial d ose 
cohort (A1) in the non -HCC group prior to initiating enrollment in cohort  B1 in the HCC 
group.  Following implementation of Protocol Amendment 5 (dated 02 July 2021) , 
non-HCC and HCC cohorts will enroll independently after safety is established in the 107 
PFU/mL monotherapy cohorts.  
The safety and efficacy of nivolumab, a PD -1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, was 
evaluated in CheckMate 040.  This phase 1b/2, open -label, non -comparative, dose 
escalation and expansion trial of nivolumab enrolled adults (  18 years) with 
histologically confirmed advanced HCC with or without hepatitis C or B virus (H  
CV or HBV) infection.  Previous sorafenib treatment was allowed.  In this study, 262 
eligible patients were treated (48  patients in the dose -escalation phase and 21 4 in the 
dose -expansion phase).  Nivolumab had a manageable safety profile and no new 
signals were observed in patients with advanced HCC.  Nivolumab 3  mg/kg was chosen

for dose expansion.  The ORR was 20  (95 CI 15–26) in patients treated with 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg in the dose -expansion phase and 15  (95 CI 6–28) in the  
dose -escalation phase (El -Khoueiry et al, 2017).   
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab was evaluated in KEYNOTE -224.  This phase 
2, randomized, multicentre, open -label trial of pembroli zumab enrolled adults 
( 18 years) with histologically confirmed advanced HCC with or without hepatitis C or B 
virus (HCV or HBV) infection.  Previous sorafenib treatment was allowed.  In this study, 
104 eligible patients were treated.  Pembrolizumab had a  manageable safety profile that 
was generally similar to that of pembrolizumab in other tumour types.  The ORR was 
17 (95 CI 11–26).  Among the [ADDRESS_47211] overall responses were 1  
complete response, 16  partial responses, 44  of participants had stable disease, 33  
had progressive disease, and 6  could not be assessed because they did not have 
assessment data after baseline (Zhu et al, 2018).  
As this is the first use of intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec with s ystemic 
IV administration of pembrolizumab, it is necessary to evaluate the safety of intrahepatic 
injection of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic IV administration of 
pembrolizumab.  As such, this study will evaluate potential blood and  tumor biomarkers 
which predict and/or are correlated with clinical outcomes to intrahepatic injection of 
talimogene laherparepvec into liver tumors alone and in combination with intrahepatic 
injection of talimogene laherparepvec and systemic IV administra tion of pembrolizumab.  
2.6 Clinical Hypotheses  
PART 1:   
Monotherapy cohorts 1 -4:  Talimogene laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver 
tumors will be safe in subjects with non -HCC with liver metastases and subjects with 
HCC without active  viral hepat itis as assessed by [CONTACT_44832].  
Combination cohorts 5 and 6:  Talimogene l aherparepvec  injected intrahepatically into 
liver tumors in combination with systemically administered pembrolizumab will be safe in 
subjects with non -HCC with liver m etastases and subjects with HCC with and without 
viral hepatitis as assessed by [CONTACT_44832].  
PART 2:   
Talimogene laherparepvec injected intratumorally in combination with systemic IV 
administration of pembrolizumab will demonstrate at least a 40 ORR in each tumor

type and be safe in the individual non -HCC tumor types as well as primary HCC  with and 
without viral hepatitis . 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open -label, basket trial to evaluate the safety of 
talimogene laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver tumors alone and in 
combination with systemic IV administration of pembrolizumab, in subjects with 
non-HCC liver metastases from BC, CRC, GEC , melanoma, NSCLC, RCC in Part 1 
Group A , and subjects w ith HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 1 Group B (viral 
hepatitis is only applicable in combination setting), and to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of intratumoral talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic 
pembrolizumab to treat sub jects with advanced TNBC, hormone receptor positive breast 
cancer, CRC, CSCC, and BCC in Part 2 Group A and subjects with HCC with and 
without viral hepatitis in Part 2 Group B .  NOTE :  as of Protocol  Amendment  6 [dated 
26 October 2021], intrahepatic injections of talimogene laherparepvec and liver 
biopsies are no longer performed in this study.  The study consists of [ADDRESS_47212] of 2  groups:  Group A (non -HCC) and 
Group  B (HCC) (with and without viral hepatitis; viral hepatitis is only applicable in 
combination setting) .  The starting dose concentrat ion used for this study will be at 
106 PFU/mL for the first cycle (to convert HSV -seronegative subjects to seropositive and 
reduce the possibility of intolerance in these subjects) followed by 107 PFU/mL with 
volumes initially up to [ADDRESS_47213] dose administered in the 005/04  pancreatic tumor injection study 
(Chang  et al, 2012).  Progression of the study through dosing cohorts in Part 1 and 
selections of MTC (see Table  1 and Study Design and Treatment Schema ) and MTV will 
depend on the DLT  evaluations that occur for each cohort .  For talimogene 
laherparepvec monotherapy, safety will be assessed for the non -HCC and HCC  groups

Cohort 5 will begin enrollment if and when safety is established from Cohort 1 in the 
respective non -HCC and HCC groups.  Subjects in Cohort 5 will be administered a 
maximum total volume of 4  mL talimogene laherparepvec in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  The minimum and maximum number of DLT -evaluable subjects for a 
dose decision will be specified in the DLRT Charter.  Subjects in Cohort  5 will be 
administered a concentr ation of 106 PFU/mL for the first cycle and 107 PFU/mL for 
talimogene  laherparepvec, up to 4  mL, 21  ( 3) days later, and Q21D (  3 days) for a 
total of 6 cycles, with an optional 6 additional cycles (see Section  3.1.3 ).  
Pembrolizumab at 200  mg Q3W can be administered fo r up to 35  cycles (approximately 
24 months) (see Section  3.5.1 for additional study duration details).  
If the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_44779] 5 is E, then Cohort  6 (Group A) or Cohort 6a (Group B) 
will open .  If cohort 6b completes sooner than 6a, and 6b is deemed safe, then coho rts 5 
and 6a will stop enrollment, and both 6a and 6b are deemed safe.   Subjects in Cohort  6 
(Group A) or 6a (Group B) will be administered a concentration of 106 PFU/mL for the 
first cycle and 108 PFU/mL of talimogene  laherparepvec, up to 4  mL, 21 ( 3) days later,

Section  3.1.3 ).  Pembrolizumab at 200  mg Q3W can be administered for up to 35  cycles 
(approximately 24  months) (see Section  3.5.1  for additional study duration details).  
If the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_44779] 6a (without viral hepatitis) for Group B is S or E after a 
minimum of 4 DLT evaluable subjects, then Cohort 6b (with viral hepatit is) in Group B 
will open. Subjects in Cohort 6b will be administered a concentration of 106 PFU/mL for 
the first cycle and 108 PFU/mL of talimogene  laherparepvec, up to 4  mL, 21 ( 3) days 
later, and Q21D (  3 days) for a total of 6  cycles with an optional  6 additional cycles (see

 4 mL within Group A and Group B as discussed in Section 10.  Subjects wi ll be 
enrolled into one of the following treatment groups and arms based on the underlying 
tumor type:  
 Group A (non -HCC):  
- Arm I:  Hormone receptor positive breast cancer  
- Arm II:  TNBC  
- Arm III:  CSCC  
- Arm IV:  BCC  
- Arm V:  CRC  
 Group B (HCC):  
- Arm VI:  HCC with  or with out viral hepatitis  
Part 2 (Group A) of the study will enroll subjects of non -HCC tumors (hormone receptor 
positive BC, TNBC, CSCC, CRC, BCC).  Subjects will be enrolled separately into each 
tumor type.  Stage 1 of Part 2 (Group A) will begin enro lling after MTC has been 
determined from Cohort 5 and 6 in Part 1.  
Part 2 (Group B) of the study will enroll subjects with HCC  with and without viral 
hepatitis .  Stage 1 of Part 2 (Group B) will begin enrolling after MTC has been 
determined from Cohorts  [ADDRESS_47217] during Part 2 of the study will progress 
independently in the non -HCC and HCC groups.  
During Stage  1 of Part 2, non -HCC and HCC groups will enroll approximately 
10 subjects for each tumor type arm (5 tu mor type arms in Group A and 1 tumor type 
arms in Group  B with and without viral hepatitis).  Subjects with specific tumor types 
from the combination cohorts in Part 1 (Cohorts  5 and 6) that are treated at the MTC 
used in Part 2, will not be included as pa rt of the enrollment numbers for that tumor type 
arm in Part 2.  Subjects enrolled in Part  [ADDRESS_47218]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

3.1.4  Safety Evaluation for Parts 1 and 2  
A DLRT, consisting of an [COMPANY_010] medical clinician, safety representative, biostatistician, 
Global Clinical Study Manager (GCTM), representative(s) from  [COMPANY_006], and at least one 
participating investigator who enrolled subjects into Part 1 and/or Part 2, will review the 
safety data to evaluate the subject incidence of DLTs and adverse events.  
Representative(s) from [COMPANY_006] will participate in DLRT meetings f or all cohorts (voting 
member only for cohort  5 and 6 of Part  1 and all cohorts in Part  2).  The DLRT will make 
recommendations in Part 1 according to the DLT 3   [ADDRESS_47222]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

dose tolerable.  In Part 2, the DLRT may consider reducing the RP2D talimogene 
laherparepvec concentration and/or discontinuation of total volumes  4 mL, if 
introduced.  If the concentration is reduced in Part 2 for a tumor type arm , then the 
sample size considerations for the 2 -stage futility and efficacy analyses of that tumor 
type arm will include only subjects treated at the reduced concentration.  The DLRT can 
consider the totality of available clinical data when reviewing a giv en cohort.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rules for DLT Evaluation and Dose Escalation for Part 1  
Monotherapy Cohorts :   
The DLT evaluation period for a given subject will consist of the period between the 
initial 106 PFU/mL dose of talimogene laherparepvec and 3 weeks following the ini tial 
107 or 108 PFU/mL dose of talimogene laherparepvec.  A subject will be considered to 
have had a DLT if they experience a DLT event (as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) during 
the DLT evaluation period.  Any subject who discontinues treatment or is lost to 
follow -up before  the end of the DLT evaluation period for any reason other than DLT will 
not be considered evaluable for DLT and may need to be replaced by [CONTACT_44862].  
Combination Cohorts:   
The DLT evaluation period for a given subject will consis t of the period between the 
initial 106 PFU/mL concentration of talimogene laherparepvec and 3  weeks following the 
initial 107 or 108 PFU/mL dose of talimogene laherparepvec.  Any subject who has not 
received at least 2 doses of talimogene laherparepvec (1 06, and 107 or 108 PFU/mL) and 
[ADDRESS_47223] had a DLT if they 
experience a DLT event (as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) during the DLT e valuation 
period.  Any subject who discontinues treatment, or is lost to follow -up before the end of 
the DLT evaluation period for any reason other than DLT, will not be considered 
evaluable for DLT and may need to be replaced by [CONTACT_44863] e cohort.  
The DLRT will meet whenever 3 to 6 subjects in each monotherapy dose cohort 
(Cohorts  1, 2, 3, and 4) of Part  1 or when a sufficient number of additional subjects (per 
the DLRT Charter), in the combination treatment cohorts (Cohorts 5 and 6 [inclu ding 6a 
and 6b]) in Part [ADDRESS_47224] incidence of DLT, and a decision regarding 
cohort escalation/modification is being considered.  The DLRT will declare a dose safe 
for Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_47225] incidence of DLT is  1/[ADDRESS_47226] to the following rules:

Monotherapy Cohorts (Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4) of Part 1.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  below for 
combination therapy (Cohorts  5 and 6):  
 If no subjects among the initial 3 evaluable subjects in Part 1 experience D LT, then 
the dose will be deemed safe.  
 If [ADDRESS_47227] among the initial 3 evaluable subjects in Part 1 experiences DLT, an 
additional 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled.  
 If  2 subjects among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable subjects in Part 1 
experienc e DLT, then the dose will be deemed safe.  
 If  [ADDRESS_47228] concentration (either 
107 or 108 PFU/mL) evaluated with a subject incidence of D LT  1/[ADDRESS_47229] volume (4 or 8 mL) 
evaluated with a subject incidence of DLT  1/3 between Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The 
MTC for Part 2 is established from Cohorts 5 and 6.  If the initial MTV in Part 2 is 4  mL, 
the MTV for Part  2 will change to 8  mL, if and when, safety of administering the higher 
volume is established from Cohorts 3 and 4 in Part  1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Evaluation for Combination Therapy in Parts 1 and 2  
For subjects enrolled in combination  therapy (Cohort 5 and 6) in Part 1, safety will be 
evaluated separately for each Group (A and B) with a common mTPI [CONTACT_25764] -and-down 
design to determine the talimogene laherparepvec MTC for each Group with a target 
DLT rate of 40 .  For Cohorts  5 and 6 in Part  1, the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_44781] (A and B).  A review of safety data in Part 1 will occur when a sufficient number of 
additional DLT -evaluable subjects (per the DLRT Charter), have been enrolled in a 
Group.   
For Part  2, the DLRT will conside r prospective guidelines in the DLRT Charter to monitor 
safety within Group A and Group B and, if introduced, talimogene laherparepvec total 
volumes  [ADDRESS_47230] 20 weeks minimum potential follow -up (see 
Section  10.2 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for mor e details).  An interim safety data review will

investigator to determine the appropriateness of treatment resumption.  Prior to 
continuing study treatment, investigator will be required to document that, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject continues to receive clinical ben efit and that the 
subject agreed to continue following a discussion of all available treatment options.  
3.2 Number of Sites  
Approximately 50 sites located in the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]), Europe, Australia, 
and Asia will participate in the study.  Additi onal sites, countries, and regions may be 
added to the study as necessary.  Sites that do not enroll subjects within 6  months of 
site initiation may be closed.  
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects ”.  A total of 
127  subjects  are enrolled in this study (74  subjects in Part 1; 53 subjects in Part 2).   
Refer to Section 10.2 for sample size considerations.  
3.4 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects enrolled and treated may be replaced in Part 1 if they are not evaluable for DLT 
(eg, did not receive talimogene laherparepvec or ended study treatment before 
completion of DLT -evaluation period for a r eason other than experiencing a DLT).  
Dose -limiting toxicity non -evaluable subjects will not be replaced in Part 2.  The 
minimum and maximum number of DLT -evaluable subjects for a dose decision will be 
specified in the DLRT Charter .

Date:  [ADDRESS_47236] ( Appendix  D), confirmed by 2 
consecutive scans  4 weeks apart (Nishino  et al, 2014), intolerance of study treatment, 
a total of 6 cycles (including the initial 106 PFU/mL cycle) have been administered and in 
the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_44783], the subject 
has received the maximum allowable cycles of talimogene laherparepvec, or the 
investigator determines it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue treatment 
(eg, rapid clinical deterioration or worsening symptomatic disease requiring alternative 
systemic anti -cancer therapy), whichever occurs first.  Confirmation of disease 
progression is required only in the absence of rapid c linical deterioration (ie, rapid 
decline in performance status or requiring other therapy) or worsening symptomatic 
disease requiring a rapid switch to alternative systemic anti -cancer therapy.   
Subjects can receive up to 35 cycles (approximately 24 month s) with pembrolizumab.  
During that time, subjects may continue until PD per the modified irRC -RECIST 
(Appendix  D), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, physician's decision to stop 
therapy for the subject, or sponsor’s decision t o terminate the study.  Discontinuation of 
treatment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed CR that have 
been treated for at least 8 cycles (24  weeks) with pembrolizumab, and had at least  
2 cycles of pembrolizumab beyond the date whe n the initial CR was declared.   
Subjects will be followed for safety for approximately 30 (  7) days after the last dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec for the monotherapy cohorts, and after the last dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec or pembrolizumab, whichever is later, for the combination 
treatment (Cohort 5 and 6 in Part  1, and all arms in Part  2).

3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion :  The primary completion date is defined as the date when the last 
subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the 
primary endpoints, whether the study concluded as planned in the protoco l or was 
terminated early.  The primary completion date is the date when all subjects (Parts 1 and 
2) have a minimum potential follow -up of  29 weeks.  
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the 
protocol (ie, earl y termination of the study), then the primary completion will be the date 
when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study 
(ie, last subject last visit).  
End of Trial :  The end of study date is defined as the date w hen the last subject is 
assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie, last subject last 
visit), following any additional parts in the study (eg, long -term follow -up), as applicable.  
The end of study will occur when the last subject  discontinues talimogene laherparepvec 
and/or pembrolizumab (whichever is later) and has had the opportunity to complete both 
the safety follow -up visit and the long -term survival follow -up (which is up to 
approximately [ADDRESS_47239] enrolled in Part 2).  
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of 
screening, tumor type) .  Screening logs may be required to be shared with [COMPANY_010].

recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All subjects must personally sign 
and da te the ICF before commencement of study -specific activities /procedures (ie, 
non-standard of care procedures).  
All subjects who enter into the screening period for the protocol  (defined as the point 
when the subject signs the informed consent) must be reg istered as screened subjects 
in the interactive voice response (IVR) system and will receive a unique subject 
identification number before any protocol -specific procedures are performed.  This 
number will be used to identify the subject throughout the  study  and must be used on all 
study  documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must 
remain constant throughout the entire study ; it must not be changed at the time of 
rescreening or enrollment.  
Subjects who are determined not  eligible after screening must be screen -failed in the 
IVR system and the reason for the screen -failure provided.  Subjects who do not meet all 
eligibility criteria may be rescreened once at the discretion of the investigator.  If a 
subject is being rescre ened, he or she may need to re -consent to the study  to ensure 
that the IRB/IEC -approved main ICF is signed within [ADDRESS_47274]’s medical record and

talimogene laherparepvec  will be 21 ( 3) days.  
The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec administered at any dose is  4 mL 
(Cohorts 1, 2, 5, and 6) or 8 mL (Cohorts 3 and 4) for any individual lesion or for all 
lesions combined.   
Part 2:   
As of Protocol  Amendment  6 (dated 26 October 2021), intrahepatic injections of 
talimogene laherparepvec  and liver biopsies are no lo nger performed in this 
study .   
In Part 2, talimogene laherparepvec can be administered into liver lesions, lymph nodes, 
cutaneous or subcutaneous tumors (non -hepatic lesions).  It is mandatory that 
administration into liver lesions is by [CONTACT_44838] (either by [CONTACT_44839]).   
Image guidance may also be used for other non -hepatic intratumoral injections but is not 
required if the lesion is easily visible or palpable.  The concentration of talimogene 
laherparepvec (107 or 108 PFU/mL) to be administered in Part 2 will be determi ned on 
completion of the combination treatment, Cohorts  5 and 6, in Part  1.  Talimogene 
laherparepvec will be used at a maximum volume of 8 mL (established from 
monotherapy Cohort  3 in Part 1 ).  No intrasubject concentration or volume escalation is 
allowed .  Investigators are encouraged to use the maximum amount whenever lesions 
allow.  Dose reduction for adverse events is not allowed.  However, if in the course of 
administration of talimogene laherparepvec  the subject cannot tolerate the full volume 
due to  an injection -related adverse event such as pain, the total volume given should be 
recorded, and the reason for intolerance should be documented as an adverse event.  
The recommended volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be injected into the tumor(s) 
depend s on the longest diameters of the tumor(s) and necrotic core of the tumor(s) (if 
applicable) and should be dosed according to the injection volume guideline in Table  3.  
Liver Lesions with Necrotic Cores  
As of Protocol  Amendment  6 (dated 26 October 2021), intrahepatic injections of 
talimogene laherparepvec  and liver biopsies are no longer performed in this 
study .  Liver lesions with a necrotic core contain less viable cancer cells for talimogene 
laherparepvec to infect. Thus, ther e are two separate dosing guidelines depending on 
whether there is a significantly sized necrotic core (the longest diameter of the necrotic

core is  75 of the longest diameter of the tumor) or not ( Table  3).  When determining 
the percent of the tumor diameter that is necrotic, measurements from the most recent 
multiphase CT or MRI should be used.  However, the longest diameters of tumors 
assessed by [CONTACT_44870]  3.  Talimogene 
laherparepvec should not be injected directly into necrotic tissue and should be 
administered into viabl e tissue.  Tumors which do not have a large enough non -necrotic 
portion to reliably inject should not be injected with talimogene laherparepvec regardless 
of the overall tumor size.

When biopsies of lesions are scheduled on treatment days ( Table  8), they should occur 
prior to injection of talimogene laherparepvec.  When injecting liver lesions, only lesions 
that have been visualized on CT or MRI multiphase scans used for tumor assessments 
may be injected.  New lesions that have appeared on injection guidance CT scans or US 
between tumor assessments CT or MRI scans, may not be injected until they have been 
visualiz ed on tumor assessment CT or MRI scans.  All reasonably injectable lesions 
should be injected with the maximum dosing volume available on an individual dosing 
occasion ( Table  3 and Table 4).  
For cutaneous, subcutaneous or superficial nodes, calipers or ruler can be used to 
measure lesions for injection.

On each treatment day, prioritization of injections is recommended as follows:  
Part 1:  
 As of Protocol  Amendment  6 (dated 26 October 2021), intrahepatic injections 
of talimogene laherparepvec  and liver biopsies ar e no longer performed in this 
study .  Any new injectable liver tumor that has appeared on tumor assessment CT 
or MRI scans since the start of treatment (from newest to oldest) .  New liver lesions 
that appear between tumor assessments scans on the CT scans or US used for 
needle guidance should not be injected until they have been imaged and measured 
on tumor assessment CT or MRI scans.  Lesion selected for injection must not be 
located, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], where any potential tumor swelling after

injection may lead to significant morbidity or obstruction or where there may be 
significant risk of bleeding.  
 By [CONTACT_44871], beginning with the largest liver tumor.  
 Any previously uninjectable liver tumor(s) that are now large enough to inject.  
Part 2:  
 As of Protocol  Amendment  6 (dated 26 October 2021), intrahepatic injections 
of talimogene laherparepvec  and liver biopsies are no longer performed in this 
study .  Any new injectable cutaneous or sub -cutaneous lesion or superficial lymph 
node that has appea red since the last injection or any new injectable liver lesion that 
has appeared on tumor assessment CT or MRI scan since the start of treatment 
(newest to oldest).  New liver or deep lymph node lesions that appear between tumor 
assessments scans on the C T scans or US used for needle guidance should not be 
injected until they have been imaged and measured on tumor assessment CT or MRI 
scans.  Lesion selected for injection must not be located, in the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], where any potential tumor swellin g after injection may lead to significant 
morbidity or obstruction or where there may be significant risk of bleeding.  
 By [CONTACT_44871], beginning with the largest tumor.  
 Any previously uninjectable tumor(s) that are now large enough to inject.  
It is recommen ded that each lesion should receive the maximum amount possible to 
inject due to tumor properties at each visit before moving on to the next lesion, using the 
prioritization model above and injection volume guideline based on tumor size per 
Table  3 and Table 4 as applicable .  Volumes of less than 0.05 mL should not be plan ned 
for administration into a lesion.  Lesions should be injected until the maximum volume 
per day (either 4 or 8 mL) has been reached, or there are no further injectable lesions, 
whichever comes first.  In Part 1, subjects must be monitored in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l for [ADDRESS_47280] 3  cycles of talimogene laherparepvec  before discharge to 
home.  The observation period may be reduced, at the investigator’s discretion, to a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_47281] received 6 cycles and in the investigator’s

laherparepvec (Section 3.1.3 ).  In Part 2, if the subject has completed  
[ADDRESS_47284] ( Appendix  D) and is able to 
tolerate treatment.  In Part 2, in the event that talimogene laherparepvec was 
discontinued for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., no further injectable lesion), and 
subject subsequently developed progressive disease or injectable disease while still on 
pembrolizumab, talimoge ne laherparepvec may be resumed if investigator and medical 
monitor are in agreement.  If the liver is to be injected, subjects must be monitored for a 
minimum of 6 hours after each talimogene laherparepvec injection.   
The concentration, start date, volume, and lot number of talimogene laherparepvec are 
to be recorded on the CRF.

Dose concentration reductions of talimogene laherparepvec are not permitted.  
Howe ver, a reduction in the volume injected due to a disease response is permitted.  
For subjects that have an INR of  1.5 or platelet  50,000/mm3 (50 x 109/L) prior to 
injection, talimogene laherparepvec administration should be delayed until INR is  1.5

[IP_ADDRESS]  Supportive Care Guidelines for Pembrolizumab  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_12707].   Suggested supportive care measures for the management of 
adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose 
modification guidelines in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , (Table  6).  Where appropriate, these 
guidelines include th e use of oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as 
additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen whe n the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.  The treatment 
guidelines are intended to be a pplied when the Investigator determines the events to be 
related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to 
pembrolizumab, the Investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance.  Refer 
to in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , for guidelines regarding dose modification and supportive care.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diet and Other Considerations Whil e Taking Pembrolizumab  
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage 
adverse events such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.

If sig ns or symptoms recur with re -challenge, then talimogene laherparepvec should be 
permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent 
discontinuation (as described in Section  6.4.1 ) should not be re -challenged without

pembrolizumab, whichever is later.  The therapy name, indication, dose, unit, frequency, 
start date, and st op date will be collected.  
Investigators should use supportive care agents in compliance with their respective 
regional label.  Investigators may not use supportive care agents as part of a separate 
clinical trial.  
6.6 Other Treatment Procedures  
As of Protoco l Amendment  6 (dated 26 October 2021), intrahepatic injections of 
talimogene laherparepvec  and liver biopsies are no longer performed in this 
study .   
Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab in the combination setting 
may result in the reduction of tumor burden such that surgical resection of previously 
unresected lesion becomes possible. Investigators may choose to resect lesions which  
become suitable for resection to render the subject free of macroscopic disease.  
Additionally, biopsies may be taken of liver lesions for tumor analysis during study.  In 
the event of a CR, any residual target lesions must be documented by [CONTACT_44879].  If a subject undergoes resection of the lesion in the 
event other than CR, the investigator or designee should notify the sponsor medical 
monitor and the procedure should be recorded in the source document and CRF.  In  
these instances, if the response of other lesions is at least PR (if other lesions remain), 
the response should be designated PR with the date of surgery as the date of response.  
If no residual disease remains following surgery, this should also be noted  in the CRF, 
the response definition again being PR if viable cancer was noted in the surgical 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date:  [ADDRESS_47323] 
response of CR or PR due to surgeries will not be considered for assessment o f ORR or 
BOR.  
Palliative surgery for relief of symptoms is allowed.  Treatment with talimogene 
laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab should be held, and the investigator or designee 
should notify the sponsor as soon as possible.  Subjects may be allowed to re main on 
study after discussion between the sponsor medical monitor and the investigator.  
Investigator must get approval from the sponsor medical monitor before resuming 
talimogene laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab.  
Local palliative radiation treatment f or relief of various symptoms, including but not 
limited to bleeding or pain associated with the underlying disease will be permitted at 
any time during the study.  Subjects with local symptoms suggestive of disease 
progression should be evaluated for tumo r response per modified irRC -RECIST (see 
Appendix  D) prior to the administration of palliative radiotherapy.  If a subject undergoes 
local radiation, the investigator or designee should notify the sponsor medical monitor as 
soon as possible and the treatment should be recorded in the source document and 
CRF.  
If a subject demonstrates evidence of new or worsening CNS metastases, talimogene 
laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab treatment should be withheld and the investigator 
or desig nee should notify the sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as possible.  Subjects 
may be allowed to remain on study after discussion between the sponsor medical 
monitor and the investigator to determine the appropriateness of treatment resumption 
provided CNS  lesions can be treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (including Gamma 
Knife), whole brain radiation, or craniotomy and if there is no change in the baseline 
ECOG performance status .  Subjects may be allowed to resume talimogene 
laherparepvec treatment pe r Section  6.2.1  following treatment of CNS metastases while 
receiving dexamethasone or a similar corticosteroid at no more than 1.5 mg 
dexamethasone (or 10 mg prednisone) per day.  If higher doses of cortico steroid are 
used, talimogene laherparepvec must be held until that dose level is reached during the 
period of steroid tapering.  
If a subject with confirmed PD (ie, two consecutive tumor assessments at least 4  weeks 
[28 days] apart demonstrating PD) is clin ically stable or clinically improved, and there is 
no further increase in tumor burden at the confirmatory assessments (assessed by [CONTACT_44880]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date:  [ADDRESS_47324], if applicable), an exception may be considered to 
continue treatment upon consultatio n with the sponsor medical monitor.

6.9 Excluded Treatments and/or Procedures During Study Period  
Subjects must not use any of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44797] (including retreatment for post-CR relapse) of this trial:  
 investigational agents (other than pembrolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec) or 
procedures   
 warfarin.  Other anticoagulants (ie. low molecular weight heparins, non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs) that do not prolong th e PT/INR may be administered after 
investigator discussion with the sponsor and as long as there is adherence to 
institutional guidelines requiring their withholding for interventional radiology 
procedures.  
 concurrent experimental or approved anti -tumor th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_44798] (as noted in Section 6.5) 
Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case by [CONTACT_44883].  The 
subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  Administration of 
palliative radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for the purposes of 
determining PFS.  
 immunotherapy not specified in this proto col 
 chemotherapy not specified in this protocol

CONFIDENTIAL    
 chronic oral or systemic steroid medication use at a dose of 10 mg/day of 
prednisone (1.5 mg/day dexamethasone) or equivalent ( with the exception of 
treatment for adverse events [see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ] and CNS metastases 
[see Section  6.5]).  S teroids with low systemic absorption [eg, triamcinolone 
hexacetonide] injected into a joint space, and intermittent use of steroid inhalers or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_44799]).  
 antiherpetic drugs, except those topi[INVESTIGATOR_44800]  
 live vaccines within [ADDRESS_47327] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus 
Calmette -Guerin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for 
injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. However, intranasal 
influenza vaccines (eg, Flu - Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
 any surgery for cancer ( other than the exceptions noted in Section 6.6) 
 Subjects must not schedule any elective non -cancer -related surgeries during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_47328] may be allowed to resume 
study drug if both the investigator and sponsor medical monitor agree  to restart study 
therapy.  
 Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the 
trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary.

and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative responses to talimogene 
laherparepvec.  No additional samples are collected for this part of th e study.  DNA may 
be extracted from blood of subjects who consent to pharmacogenetic analyses.  
7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood or tumor samples collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  8 through  Table 13) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol 
and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  Th is includes testing to 
ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the 
study.  This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, 
incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method tra nsfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in  a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
cancer, the dose response and/or predicti on of response to talimogene laherparepvec, 
characterization of antibody response, and characterization of aspects of the molecule 
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not n ecessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_47392]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44810].  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropri ate processes for discontinuation  
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44811]  (Table  8 
through  Table 13) including different options for follow -up (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648]/email, 
through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treat ing physicians, 
the review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints and adverse 
events.  Subjects that have discontinued investigational product and/or protocol required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44812] m the study.  Whenever 
safe and feasible, it is imperative that subjects remain on study to undergo safety 
surveillance and/or collection of outcome data.  The investigator must document the 
change to the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  8 through  Table 13) and the level of 
follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Eve nts 
9.1.1  Definition of Disease Related Events  
Disease related events are events (serious or non -serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  These could include events such as 
pain or discomfort caused by [CONTACT_44909].   Such 
events do not meet the definition of an adverse event unless assessed to be more 
severe than expected for the subject’s condition and/or if the investigator believes that 
the event is related to the investigationa l product(s)/study treatment/protocol required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
All serious disease -related events will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness  of the event .   
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date: 26 October 2021  Page 133 of 196 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Disease -related events that would qualify as an adverse event or serious adverse event:  
 An event based on the underlying disease that is worse than expected as assessed 
by [CONTACT_44910]’s condition or if the investigator believes there is a 
causal relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment/protocol -
required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21887], this must be reported as an adverse 
event or serious adverse event.  
Disease -related events that do not qualify as adverse events or serious adverse events:  
 An eve nt which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44814]) is to be 
reported as a disease -related event.    
Further, any disease related event which meets any of the seri ousness criteria in 
Section  9.1.3  should be reported as a Serious Disease Related Event.  
Note:  For situations where disease related events are due to the subject’s primary 
cancer, the primary tumor type (eg, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma) should be 
used, rather than  the term “disease progression”.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_47400]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening ind icates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, 
diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome th an expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, 
is not con sidered an adverse event.   
Note:  For situations where an adverse event due to the subject’s primary cancer,  the 
primary tumor type (eg, metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma) should be used, rather 
than the term “disease progression” .   
The investigator’s  clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44815] e to an adverse event, refer to Section  8.[ADDRESS_47401]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date: [ADDRESS_47402] 1 of the 
following serious criteria:  
 fatal 
 life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 other medically important serious event  
A disease related event (eg, disease progression)  is to be reported as a serious adverse 
event if:   
 the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator woul d 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a subject with the same underlying condition, or  
 if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between talimogene 
laherparepvec and/or pembrolizumab and the event,  
 and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria a bove.  
 additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal disease related event as 
serious adverse event  
*Note:  In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below 
criteria, although not serious per the International Cou ncil for Harmonisation (ICH) 
definition, are reportable to [COMPANY_010] in the same timeframe as serious adverse 
events to meet certain local requirements.  
Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_44911].  
 Is a new cancer (that is n ot a condition of the study);  
 Is associated with an overdose.  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could

include allergic b ronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI, or events that 
necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events  
Disease -related events are d efined in Section 9.1.1 .

disease related eve nt on the event s CRF as a serious adverse event.  
All serious disease -related events will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated serious disease -
related event data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  
Disease -related events assessed by [CONTACT_44913]/or related to the talimogene laherparepvec or pembrolizumab, and determined to be 
serious must be reported on the event s CRF as serious adverse events and recorded 
and reported per Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_47403] assign the following attributes to 
each disease -related event:  
 Disease -related event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or

All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before enrollment must 
be reported by [CONTACT_26364], or 
are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not  limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, or a procedure.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
management of hepatic even ts of clinical interest.  
The investigator must assign the following attributes to each adverse event:  
 adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
 did the event start prior  to first dose of investigational product and other protocol -
required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],

or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by a study activity (eg, administration of talimogene laherparepvec, 
and/or procedure”?  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents  a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes  that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
If the severity of an adverse event worsens from the date  of onset to the date of 
resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the events CRF.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
It is not acceptable for the investiga tor to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical

[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serious adverse e vents will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_47409] be consistent with that 
recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -requir ed reporting period (as defined in Section 9.1.3 ) or after the end of 
study.  However, these serious adverse events must be reported to [COMPANY_010]  (regardless 
of causality) if the investigator becomes aware of them .  Per local requirements in  some 
countries (eg, European Union [EU] member states), investigators are required to report 
serious adverse events that they become aware of after the end of s tudy.  If serious 
adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24  hours 
following the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside the protocol -required reporting period that 
occur during  the long -term follow -up period until the end of study are to be captured in 
the Adverse Events CRF, although these events will not be considered treatment -
emergent adverse events. Serious adverse events reported outside of the 
protocol -required reporting period that occur after the end of the study  will be captured 
within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Monitoring Plan  
Subject safety will be routinely monitored as defined in [COMPANY_010]’s safety surveil lance and 
signal management processes.

the Sponsor and recorded in the database.  
Immediate assessment in case of HECI:  
All Participants  
 All participants should be considered for evaluation according to the directions below 
within 72  hours of  the alert for a non -overdose ECI.  For lab assessments of HECIs, 
central laboratory is preferred; local laboratory is acceptable if central laboratory is 
not available.  
 Procedures:  
○ Consider obtaining a consultation with a hepatologist

○ Obtain a work -up for  hepatitis if there is no underlying hepatitis, including 
hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, Epstein -Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus  
○ Assess for ingestion of drugs/supplements with hepatotoxic potential  
○ Assess for alcohol ingestion  
○ Assess for potential bacterial infe ction, biliary obstruction, or occult 
gastrointestinal bleeding  
○ Repeat ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, -glutamyl 
transpeptidase, INR, and complete blood count with differential  
○ Measure HCV RNA viral load (applies only fo r participants who have current 
active HCV infection or had infection in the past)  
○ HBV DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, anti -HBc (total and IgM), anti -HBe, and anti -HBs 
regardless of prior HBV status (Note:  participants should be questioned about 
compliance with the us e of antiviral agents)  
○ Other laboratories or imaging studies as clinically indicated  
○ Consider liver biopsy if indicated  
HCC patients are at risk for a range of complications that can cause hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities with or without clinical decompens ation.  Those with a history of chronic 
HCV or HBV infection also have the potential to experience virologic flares.  Immune -
related hepatitis has been observed in approximately 1 -2 of participants who received 
pembrolizumab.  The following section provid es further guidance on the diagnosis and 
management of potential hepatic complications among HCC participants in this study.  
The recommendation is to hold pembrolizumab interventions and initiate per table.

The sample size of approximately 3 to 6 subjects per monotherapy cohort is determined 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_44818] “3 3” phase  1 designs to 
evaluate safety assuming a true DLT rate of less than 1/3.  There are up to 
4 monotherapy cohorts in Groups A / B in Part 1.   Subjects enrolled in a monotherapy 
cohort may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT (eg, did not receive talimogene 
laherparepvec or ended the study treatment before completion of the DLT evaluation 
period for a reason other than experiencing a D LT).  Table  [ADDRESS_47432]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

Sample Size Considerations for Part 2  
The recommended phase 2 dose from Part 1 (RP2D) for non -HCC (Group  A) and HCC 
(Group  B) will be evaluated in Part [ADDRESS_47435] 29 weeks.  The null 
hypothesis (H0) for each tumor type is an ORR  10 which, if true, would not warrant 
further evaluation in contrast to the alternative hypothesis (H1) of an ORR  40.   
The following [ADDRESS_47436] H0 at a  2.5 1-sided significance 
level.  The efficacy analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set in Part 2 only .A 
cumulative total of 10 subjects will be treated in Stage 1 and enrollment is planned to 
stop.  If there are 2 or more responders ( PR or CR  no confirmation is needed), then a 
total of 11 additional subjects will be treated in Stage 2; otherwise, H0 will be accepted 
and enrollment will be permanently discontinued.  If the required number of responders 
to continue to Stage  2 is observed before the end of Stage  1 enrollment, then enrollment 
will not be suspended.  
H0 will be rejected after Stage 2 if there are  6 responders (with confirmation) in 21 
treated subjects, ie, the observed ORR is  28.6.  In the event precisely  [ADDRESS_47437]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

95 exact binomial CI is  10 (Atkinson  and Brown,  1985).  If exactly 10 and 11 
subjects are included at Stage 1 and 2, respectively, the design achieves a 1 -sided 1.3 
significance level, 88.4  power, and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_44820] 1 if H0 (H1) is 
true is 73.6  (4.6). 
For each tumor  type that advances to Stage  2, a Bayesian framework will be utilized to 
assess evidence that the combination ORR exceeds that expected for pembrolizumab 
alone to aid in decision -making as to whether further evaluation is warranted.  Further 
detail will be  described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
From 10 to 21 subjects per tumor type are expected to be treated at the RP2D for a total 
of 60 to 126 subjects.  
For Part 2, the DLRT will consider prospective guidelines in the DLRT Charter to monitor 
safety sep arately by [CONTACT_44924], if introduced, talimogene laherparepvec total 
volumes  [ADDRESS_47438] 6 weeks minimum potential follow -up.   
The maximum  total sample size for Parts  1 and 2 is 127  subjects ( 74 subjects in 
Part 1; 53 subjects in Part  2).  Dose -limiting toxicity non -evaluable subjects will not be 
replaced in Part 2.  
10.3 Planned Analyses  
10.3.1  Interim Analyses  
Dose -limiting toxicities interim sa fety analyses will be performed to support the 
evaluation of safety and determination of the MTC and MTV of talimogene 
laherparepvec administered as monotherapy and in combination with systemic 
pembrolizumab.  Interim efficacy analysis for part 1 will be p erformed as needed  Interim 
safety and efficacy futility analyses are planned for this study in Part 2 separately for 
each tumor type  arm.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  DLT Safety Analysis (Part 1)  
The planned interim safety data reviews for monotherapy cohorts in Part [ADDRESS_47439] incidence of DLTs will be conducted according to timing/rules described in 
Table  1 (Section 3.1.1 ).  Data will be reviewed by a DLRT.  The DLRT will recommend 
either to declare the cohort dose intolerable, to reassess safety after [ADDRESS_47440]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

CONFIDENTIAL    
DLT-evaluable subjects, or to declare the cohort dose tolerable and to apply the same 
evaluation rules to subsequent cohorts.   
For combination cohorts in Part 1, the DLRT will recommend according to the DLRT 
Charter whether it is safe to continue  enrollment based on the mTPI  [CONTACT_25764]-and-down 
design.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interim Safety Analysis ( Part 2 ) 
An interim safety data review will occur for each tumor type separately after 
approximately [ADDRESS_47441] 4 DLT -evaluable subjects or after a target of approximately 6 and 16 
DLT-evaluable subjects.  As appropriate the DLRT will be convened to monitor safety.  
A total volume  4 mL of talimogene laherparepvec may be allowed in Part 2 with 
systemic pembrolizumab if it is declared safe without pembrolizumab in Part 1.  In this 
event, the DLRT will also monitor safety in Part 2 separatel y among subjects in 
non-HCC (Group A) and HCC (Group B) arms  that receive at least 1  dose of talimogene 
laherparepvec with a total volume  4 mL at the combination MTC with systemic 
pembrolizumab.  Subjects will be included in the safety assessment of  [ADDRESS_47442] 3 weeks follow -up from an initial total volume  4 mL at the combination MTC.   
Safety analyses , including analyses of the subjects receiving a total volume  4 mL 
talimogene laherparepvec,  will be performed at the time of the planned a nalyses for 
each tumor type arm or more frequently at the DLRTs discretion.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interim Futility Analysis (Part 2)  
One interim efficacy futility analysis will occur after [ADDRESS_47443] 20 weeks.  Enrollment will be suspended for the specific tumor type pending 
the outcome of the interim analysis.  If there are 2 or more responders ( CR or PR  
confirmation not required), then a total of 11 addi tional subjects will be treated; 
otherwise, further enrollment of the tumor type arm will be permanently discontinued.  If

10.3.2  Dose Level  Review Team (DLRT)  
A DLRT consisting of the [COMPANY_010] study team, including at least one medical clinician, 
safety representative and biostatistician, at least one representative of the [COMPANY_006] study 
team, and at least one participating investigator who has rec ruited subjects into Part 1, 
will review the safety data to evaluate possible DLTs.  Representative(s) from [COMPANY_006] will 
participate in DLRT meetings for all cohorts (voting member only for Cohorts  5 and 6 of 
Part 1 and all cohorts of Part  2).  The DLRT will  make recommendations in Part  1 and 2 
according to a DLRT Charter.  The DLRT Charter will include guidelines to monitor 
safety in Part 2 separately by [CONTACT_44924], if introduced, talimogene 
laherparepvec total volumes  4 mL within Group A and Group  B.  In Part 2, the DLRT 
may consider reducing the RP2D talimogene laherparepvec concentration and/or 
discontinuation of total volumes  4 mL, if introduced.   
10.3.3  Primary Analysis  
One clinical study report (CSR) will be written based on the results of the pri mary 
analyses across Part 1 and Part 2.   
Primary Analysis:  The primary analysis for each combination  cohort from Part  [ADDRESS_47445] a minimum potential 
follow -up of  [ADDRESS_47446]

10.3.4  Final Analysis  
Final Analysis:  The final analysis will occur when all subjects have discontinued the 
study treatment and have had the opportunity to complete the long -term survival 
follow -up.  One CSR will be written with the updated results from the final analyses at 
the completion of the study.  
10.4 Planned Methods of Analysis  
The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_9084]/group (non -HCC and HCC), in the overall population

The DLT analysis set will be used to summarize the subject incidence of DLT for the 
study and the safety analysis set will be used for all other analyses of safety endpoints 
(including but not limited to all adverse events, grade  [ADDRESS_47447]).  For talimogene laherparepvec 
monotherapy, safety will be assessed for non -HCC (Group  A) and HCC (Group  B) 
groups based on the “3   3” design.  For the combination of talimogene laherparepvec 
with pembrolizumab, safety will be assessed for non -HCC (Group A) and HCC 
(Group  B) groups based on the mTPI [CONTACT_25764] -and-down design.  
Part [ADDRESS_47448] .  The null hypothesis of a 10  ORR for a given tumor type 
that continued to Stage [ADDRESS_47449] binomial 95  CI for the ORR is 
above 10 (Atkinson  and Brown,  1985). The primary analysis of efficacy will include 
subjects that receive at least [ADDRESS_47450] 1 dose of 
pembrolizumab in combination from  Part 2.   
For each tumor type that advances to Stage 2, a Bayesian framework will be utilized to 
assess evidence that the combination ORR exceeds that expected for pembrolizumab 
alone to aid in decision -making as to whether further evaluation is warranted .  Further 
detail will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] encourages the formation of 
a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate [COMPANY_010] staff, 
the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  The 
committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff, as appropriate,  as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] sta ff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to  be met for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  (ICMJE ) Recommendations for 
the Conduct of Reporting, Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical 
Journals, which states:  
 Authorship credit should  be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the 
work in ensuring that questions rel ated to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the 
work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 
2, 3, and 4.  
 When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who acc ept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should  fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
 Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
 All persons designated as authors should  qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should  be listed.  
 Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.

Response  
Note:  Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC) simulating Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Soli d Tumors version (RECIST) version 1.1 [irRC -RECIST] defined by 
[CONTACT_44931], 2014, with modification will employed to account for unique tumor 
response characteristics observed with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_44823], if the subject is  clinically stable.  
Method of Measurement Tumor Lesions:  
CT scans (or MRI):  
Computed tomography (CT) scans by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced or spi[INVESTIGATOR_44824] (or magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI] scan) will be performed to evaluate tumor response for visceral 
or nodal/so ft tissue disease (including lymph nodes).  Measurability of lesions on 
CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_47486] or to MRI (or vice versa) should 
not pre clude response assessment if, in the judgment of the site radiologist, there is no 
significant difference in the assessment by [CONTACT_44932].  This may occur if a 
subject has developed a medical contraindication to intravenous (IV) contrast for CT 
scans while on trial.  This change would require the preapproval of the sponsor medical 
monitor.  
Positron Emission Tomography ( PET)/CT Scans:   
If a combined PET/CT scan is performed at the discretion of the investigator, the 
CT portion of that exam should n ot be substituted for the dedicated CT exams required 
by [CONTACT_3181].  The PET portion of the CT may introduce additional data which may 
bias the investigator assessment of response if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
However, if the investiga tor or the site radiologist can document that the CT performed 
as part of a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral 
contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for tumor measurements.

Ultrasound:  
Ultraso und (US) should not be used as a primary method to assess liver lesion 
measurements in response to treatment.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_44933], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  
At baseline, lesions are categorized as mea surable or non -measurable according to the 
following definitions:  
Measurable  Lesions : 
Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (ie, longest diameter for non -nodal lesions and short axis  for 
lymph nodes will be measured and followed) with a minimum size of:  
  [ADDRESS_47487] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) or MRI  
 A lymph node must be  [ADDRESS_47488]’s overall disease (eg, largest 
lesions per organ).  
Non-Measurable Lesions : 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with  10 mm but  15 mm short axis) and other truly non -measurable 
lesions are considered non -measurable and characterized as non -target l esions.  This 
will include any measurable lesions beyond the maximum number of 10 that were not 
chosen as target lesions.  Only cancerous lesions should be selected as 
non-measurable lesions and not indeterminate lesions and lesions that could be cancer.  
Other examples of  
non-measurable lesions include some bone lesions*, leptomeningeal disease, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of the skin or (lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis), and groups of lesions that are small and numerous.  
Fluid Colle ctions  
Ascites, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion should not be selected as 
non-measurable disease at baseline or, if new or increased, as evidence of progressive 
disease (PD).  These collections may occur with both benign and malignant conditions,  
and their etiology is often not clear.  These collections may often be removed via

CONFIDENTIAL    
interventional procedures, which can lead to a false interpretation of disease response.  
Thus, these fluid collections should not be used as a baseline non -target or as ev idence 
of disease response.  
* Bone Lesions:  
 Bone scans, PET scans or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measures bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or absence of bone lesions.  
 Osteolytic (lytic) bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft 
tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging technique such 
as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the defin ition of measurability described above.  Only the soft tissue 
component of the bone lesion should be measured.  
 Many osteoblastic (blastic) bone abnormalities can be benign and should not be 
selected as baseline lesions.  An isolated new small blastic lesio n should not be 
selected as a new lesion unless there is demonstrated growth on subsequent scans.  
Multiple new blastic lesions that are clearly cancerous may be considered for new 
lesions.  
Cystic Lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographicall y defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable or non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  If a cystic lesion is clearly cancerous and has both 
cystic and solid components, t hen the complete lesion should be measured including 
both components without excluding the cystic portion of a cystic tumor lesion when 
measuring.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or an area subjec t to other 
loco-regional therapy, should not be considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions:  
Baseline evaluations will be used to prospectively identify all  sites of disease present as 
close as possible to the enrollment and never more than 4 weeks before the enrollment 
date.  Sites of disease will be characterized as either target or non -target lesions.  
Baseline Documentation of Target Lesions:  
Up to 10 targ et lesions (a maximum of 5 per organ) will be chosen to measure over the 
course of therapy.  Pathological lymph nodes that are defined as measurable must meet

the criterion of a short axis of  [ADDRESS_47489]’s overall 
disease status.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
longest diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_28171].  In situations where larger lesions cannot be accurately measured 
repeatedly (eg, near the diaphragm where respi[INVESTIGATOR_44825]), smaller lesions that meet criteria for measurability may be selected 
instead.  
A sum  of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The 
baseline sum of diameters will be used as reference by [CONTACT_44934].   
Baseline Documentation of Non -Target Lesions:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including any measurable lesions that were not 
chosen as target lesions and pathological lymph node with short axis  10 mm but 
 15 mm, should be identified as non-target lesions.   Measurable non -target lesions  
(ie, lesions in an organ beyond the allowed maximum number of targets that would 
otherwise qualify as target lesions) should also be recorded and assessed qualitatively 
over the course of therapy.  Non -measurable non -target disease measurements are not 
required, but these lesions are evaluated at each timepoint and will be evaluated as 
‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.  If a significant partial 
response (PR) is observed in a non -target lesion, it should be described as a comm ent. 
Follow -up Assessment of Tumor Lesions:  
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of diameters of target lesions identified 
at baseline plus the sum of diameters of up to 10 (maximum 5 per organ) new 
measurable lesions (ie, accurately and serially m easured in at least [ADDRESS_47490] diameter is  10 mm for non -nodal lesions or the short axis is 
 15 mm for non -nodal lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor burden.  
If more than 10 new measurable lesions total (or  5 per organ) are present at a single 
timepoint, the new measurable lesions should be selected on the basis of their size and 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_15218] (CT or MRI).  If

there are lesions beyond of the new measurab le lesion limit, the additional lesions would 
be considered new non -measurable lesions.  
Tumor Burden  sum of diameters of target lesions  sum of diameter of up to 
10 (maximum 5 per organ) new, measurable lesions.  
Non-target disease measurements are not r equired and these lesions should be 
followed as “present”, “absent”, or “unequivocal progression”.  
For radiographically assessed non -nodal disease the convention will be used that if a 
lesion being measured decreases in size to  [ADDRESS_47491] that 
the non -nodal lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 
“0 mm”.  Nodal disease should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  For complete response (CR), each 
node must achieve a short axis 10 mm.  
Response Evaluation:  
Evaluation of Objective Response:  
The subject response will be assessed based on tumor burden (the sum of diameters of 
target lesions plu s the sum of up to 10 [maximum 5 per organ] new measurable lesions), 
and, in the case of CR, the presence of any non -target and/or new non -measurable 
lesions.  The overall response is derived from time -point response assessments as 
described in Table  [ADDRESS_47492]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

Table  19.  Definition of Measurable Tumor Response  
(Baseline Target and New, Measurable Lesions)  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all lesions (whether meas urable or not 
and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, 
consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks (28  days) 
from the date first documented.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in 
short axis to  10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR):  Decrease in tumor burden*  30 relative to baseline 
confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks 
(28 days) after first documentation  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Increase in tumor burden*  20  and at least 5  mm 
absolute increase relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor 
burden) confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment 
no less than 4 weeks (28  days) from the date first 
documented PD.  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD.  
Unable to Evaluate (UE):  Any lesion present at baseline which was not assessed or 
was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to 
determine the status of that particular tumor for that time 
point.  
Note:  If a subset of target / new measurable lesions were 
assessed and the tumor burden increase of the subset is 
sufficient to declare PD without the contribution of the 
unevaluated lesions, then PD should be reported.  
Not Applicable (NA)  No target lesions we re identified at baseline  
Not Done (ND)  Radiographic imaging or clinical assessment was not 
performed at this time point to evaluate the response of 
measurable lesions

c No target lesions identified at bas eline. When a patient has only nonmeasurable disease (ie, no target 
lesions identified at baseline) the response will be unevaluable.  
d No non -target lesions identified at baseline.  
e Disappearance of all non -lymph node lesions and all lymph nodes  10 mm in short axis would also be CR 
even if lymph node measurements prevent 100  tumor burden reduction.  
f In addition to relative increase of  20, the tumor burden must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 
 5 mm from nadir for PD.  
CR   complete response; PR  partial response; SD  stable disease; PD  progressive 
disease; UE   unable to evaluate; ND  not done; NA  not applicable. Determination of 
best overall response is based on changes in total tumor burden from the baseline 
(nadir,  for PD) tumor assessment, regardless of any initial increase in baseline lesions or 
the appearance of new lesions.  
Subjects are considered to have PR or stable disease (SD) even if new lesions were 
present, as long as they met the respective thresholds of  response as described in 
Table  20. 
Subjects with SD, particularly those with slow -declining tumor burden  20 from 
baseline at the last tumor assessment, are considered clinically meaningful because 
they show an objectively me asurable reduction in tumor burden without reaching the 
30 threshold that defines PR.

Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date: [ADDRESS_47493] dose  date; otherwise the overall response will be UE.  
Confirmation of Response (CR or PR):  
To be assigned a status of CR or PR changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_44935] 4 weeks 
(28 days) after the criteria for response are first met.  
In some circu mstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (ie, biopsy) to confirm the CR status.  
Confirmation of Dis ease Progression:  
If a subject is classified as having PD at a postbaseline tumor assessment, then 
confirmation of PD by a second assessment  4 weeks (28 days) later in the absence of 
rapid clinical deterioration (ie, rapid decline in performance status) or symptomatic 
disease requiring rapid initiation of alternative systemic anti -cancer therapy is required.  
The definition of confirmation of progression represents a  20 and at least 5  mm 
absolute increase in the total tumor burden (ie, the sum of diame ters of target lesions 
plus up to 10 [maximum 5 per organ] new measurable lesions) compared to the nadir at 
two consecutive time -points at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart (with the date of 
progression considered to be the time of the initial evaluation showi ng PD) .  It is 
recommended that this be done at the discretion of the investigator because follow -up 
with observation alone may not be appropriate for subjects with a rapid decline in 
performance status.  Confirmation of PD allows for the capture of all ob served 
responses using the irRC -RECIST as most of these late responding subjects have a 
trend toward response within 4 weeks (28 days) after initial PD.  
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without ob jective evidence of PD at the time should have the reason for 
treatment discontinuation specified.  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
Determining a New Nadir After Intervention -therap y: 
After the intervention -therapy for liver lesions is completed, subjects will undergo 
radiological imaging by [CONTACT_44936] [ADDRESS_47494] intervention tumor assessment will provide the 
“new nadir”  from which progression will be assessed.  Any remaining sites of disease

Protocol Number:  20140318  
Date: [ADDRESS_47495] had Complete Removal of the Lesion will be Evaluated as 
Follows:  
The completely resected lesion should continue to be documented on the case report 
forms (CRFs) and assigned a default code of absent (f or nontarget lesions) or a value of 
[ADDRESS_47496] diameter for the purpose of calculating the sum of the diameters  
(for target lesion), and determining the post intervention -therapy response.  This will 
allow continued response determination from sc reening.  
If the resected lesion contained no tumor under pathology evaluation, subsequent tumor 
assessments post -procedure may be used for tumor burden calculations and/or 
determination of response.  If the resected lesion contained tumor or pathology results 
were unknown, the recorded tumor assessments post -procedure may be used for tumor 
burden calculations, but determination of response will be considered unevaluable (UE) 
for response except in the case of PD.  If the new tumor burden post -procedure is lower 
than the nadir before the procedure, then the new nadir will be set to the post -procedure 
tumor burden.  Otherwise, the previous pre -procedure nadir will be retained as the nadir. 
Subsequent assessments for PD will be determined from the nadir.  
Guidance on quantitative/qualitative reporting of fully resected lymph nodes is below 
(see Table  21). 
If new radiographic imaging findings develop at the surgical/treatment site that were not 
present on the immediate post intervent ion-therapy imaging assessments and are 
indicative of tumor recurrence, the tumor will be considered a new lesion, and measured 
accordingly, with the response assessed as PD if increase in tumor burden  20 and at 
least [ADDRESS_47497] 4  weeks (28 days) apart.

Subjects who have had Partial Removal/ Reduction of the Lesion will be Evaluated 
as Follows:  
In subjects where the tumor can still be confidently identified, it s hould be measured 
(target lesion) or qualitatively evaluated (nontarget lesion) and response (CR, PR or SD) 
or progression should be determined.  Response is judged compared to the screening 
time point and PD should be judged compared with the nadir as det ailed in Table  19 and 
Table  20. 
In subjects where the interventional -therapy was not thought to be completely effective 
and residual tumor cannot be distinguished from the effects of therapy, the size o f the 
residual tumor should be considered too small to measure and assigned a default code 
of present (for nontarget lesion) or a default value of 5 mm as the sum of the diameters  
(for target lesion).  If this is the nadir, PD will be judged from this sum of the diameters . 
A partially resected lesion should be assigned its measurement post -procedure (for 
target lesions) or “present” (for non -target lesions).  If the resected lesion contained no

be used for tumor burden calculations and/or determination of response.  If the resected 
lesion contained tumor or pathology results were unknown, the recorded tumor 
assessments post -procedure may be used for tumor burden calculations, b ut 
determination of response will be considered unevaluable (UE) for response except in 
the case of PD.  If the new tumor burden post -procedure is lower than the nadir before 
the procedure, then the new nadir will be set to the post -procedure tumor burden.   
Otherwise, the previous pre -procedure nadir will be retained as the nadir.  Subsequent 
assessments for PD will be determined from the nadir.  
Merging Lesions  
When two or more target/new measurable lesions merge, the smaller lesion should have 
[ADDRESS_47499] diameter of the merged lesion recorded for the current assessment and 
be followed for future assessments.  When two or more non -target/new non -measurable 
lesions me rge, the smaller lesion should be recorded as absent for the current and all 
future assessments, and the larger lesion should be recorded as present for the current 
assessment and followed for future assessments.  If a target/new measurable lesion and 
a non-target/new non -measurable lesion merge, the non -target/new non -measurable 
lesion should be absent for the current and all future assessments while the target 
lesion/new measurable lesion should include both merged lesions for recording 
measurements.

Definition of Females of Childbearing Potential  
A female is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Females in the following categories are not considered female of childbearing potentia l: 
Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
- Documented hysterectomy;  
- Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]; or  
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
Note:  Site personnel documentation from the following sources is acceptable:   
1) review of subject’s medic al records; 2) subject’s medical examination; or  
3) subject’s medical history interview.  
Premenarchal female  
Postmenopausal female  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  A high follicle stimulat ing hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women 
not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).

Acceptable Methods of Effective Contraception  
- Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen -only hormonal 
methods given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or imp lantable route)  
- Intrauterine device (IUD)  
- Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system (IUS)  
- Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion  
- Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female subject of childbearing potential and that the va sectomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success)  
- Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual 
abstinence m ust be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)  
- Double barrier method:  the male uses a condom and the female may choose 
either a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (a female condom is not an 
option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom)  
Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for  Female Subjects  
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include:  
- Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptother mal, postovulation methods)  
- Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  
- Spermicides only  
- Lactational amenorrhoea method

known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.   
Subjects should be informed that taking pembrolizumab may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to 
participate in the study, men and women of reproductive potential must adhere to the 
contraception requirements ( See Section 4.1.2 , exclusion criteria  224, 225, and 226 ) 
from the day of pembrolizumab  initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of 
pembrolizumab  for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 4 months  
(120 days ) after the last dose of pembrolizumab .  If there is any question that a subject 
of reproductive potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, 
that subject should not be enrolled into the study.  
Use of Pembroliz umab in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with systemic 
pembrolizumab, the subject will immediately be removed from the study.  The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to the sponsor and followed as described in  
Section  9.3 (Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting).  If a male subject impregnates his 
female partner, the investigator must be informed immediately and the pregnancy 
reported to the sponsor and followed as described in Section  9.3 (Pregnancy and 
Lactation Reporting).  
Use of Pembrolizum ab in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, female subjects who are breast -feeding are no t eligible for enrollment in 
this study.

Amendment Date:  26 October 2021  
 
Rationale:  
This protocol is being amended to stop study -related hepatic biopsies and hepatic injections of 
talimogene laherparepvec based on the overall safety  assessment  of the hepatic  hemorrhage 
signal  following  two serious adverse events of hepatic h aemorrhage that result ed in death  in the 
study.  While the full safety assessment results did not suggest an increased risk of hepatic 
haemorrhage  with talimogene laherparepvec as a medication , there is a potential risk of hepatic 
haemorrhage  with the transcutaneous intrahepatic route of administration of talimogene  
laherparepvec and hepatic biopsies .  As a result, the protocol is amended to remove these 
procedures from study conduct.   Additionally, the final enrollment numbers have been updated 
in the protocol as enrollment has stopped for this study.

Talimogene Laherparepvec Injected into Liver Tumors
[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number TVEC [ADDRESS_47525] number 2014 -005386 -67
Amendment Date: 26 April 2016
Rationale:
The previous version of the protocol considered a grade 3 or higher non- hematologic 
laboratory value that persisted for > 1 week as meeting the criteria for a DLT, even if the 
abnormal laboratory value did not result in a medical inter vention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543].  This 
criterion could result in dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) being determined for abnormal 
laboratory values that were not clinically important.  To date, [ADDRESS_47526] has had a grade 3 
or higher gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT) elevation that pers isted for over [ADDRESS_47527] was asymptomatic, and the 
GGT elevation was considered to not be of any clinical significance. In order to prevent 
abnormal laboratory values that are not clinically significant from being classified as 
DLTs, the Dose Level Review Team (DLRT) decided that the protocol should be 
amended.   This modification will also be consistent with the protocol l anguage in 
Section 9.2.2 , where abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on 
investigator’s judgement) are not to be recorded as adverse events.
The following key changes have been incorp orated into protocol amendment 1:
The criteri a for grade [ADDRESS_47528] for > 1 week which are 
deemed not clinically important by [CONTACT_44937] a DLT.  Any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic laboratory value will still 
be considered a DLT if medical intervention is required or if it leads to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
Treatment can continue for grade [ADDRESS_47529] for > 1 week and are deemed n ot clinically important by [CONTACT_44938][INVESTIGATOR_44826] -hematologic laboratory values with no clinical 
significance and long half -lives such as GGT.
Added hepatitis D viral RNA as another acceptable method of testing as some 
institutions do not use hepatitis D serology testing.

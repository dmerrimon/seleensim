==================================================== ======= ==========  
 
Throughout the consent form, “you” always refers to the person who takes part in the 
study.  
 
Why is this research study being conducted?  
 
We are asking you to  take part in a research study to evaluate whether a new collision 
warning device helps to reduce collisions with obstacles in everyday walking.  People 
with vision impairment and blindness sometimes bump into obstacles when walking 
around and are at higher  risk for collisions and falls than people with normal vision.   
 
We are a sking you to take part because you have  a diagnosis of hemianopia (loss of 
vision on the same side in both eyes), tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), or very 
severe vision loss (including complete blindness).   
 
We expect to enroll about [ADDRESS_717715] ? 
 
The principal investigators for this study are [CONTACT_548311] and [CONTACT_548312]. The 
study takes place at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. The U. S. Army Medical 
Research and Materi el Command is providing funding for the study.

 A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,  as 
required by U.S. Law.  This website will not include information that can identify you.  
At most, the website will i nclude a summary of the results.  You can search this website 
at any time.  
 
How long will this study take and w hat will happen in this study?  
 
It will take you about 2.[ADDRESS_717716] visit, screening tests will be conducted to determine whether you meet the 
inclusion criteria for this study.  These screening tests will include measurements of your 
vision (described below) and a brief test of cognitive function.  If you have hemianopia, 
you will also be asked to complete simple paper -and-pencil tests for neglect. You must 
meet the study criteria in order to participate in the rest of the study.  
 
Vision measures  
You may have your visual acuity (ability to read letters) measured using a computer -
based system or a chart. You may also have your visual fields (extent of vision) measured 
using a conventional clinical instrument, or a new computer -based system. For the visual 
fields measurements you will sit with your chin in a chin rest and press a response button 
when you see targets appear on a screen in front of you.  
 
Collision warning dev ice 
The device is about the size of a smart phone and looks very similar to a smart phone. It 
has a small camera with a wide field of view that monitors the area ahead and to the side 
of where you are walking. The device uses the information from the camer a to calculate 
the risk of colliding with moving and stationary objects in your travel path. The device 
will give simple warnings of the direction of potential obstacles and the collision risk to 
help you avoid contact [CONTACT_548303]. Warnings will  be given only when you 
approach obstacles which are a collision risk. Warnings will not be given when you are 
close to objects which are not a collision risk. The warnings will be auditory sounds (e.g. 
a series of beeps) and vibrations (from vibrating wri st bracelets). The device will be used 
in conjunction with any other visual aids or mobility devices, such as a long cane, that 
you already use. The device is very light and is worn in a pouch attached to a belt, or can 
be placed in a pocket (provided the camera has an unobstructed view of the path ahead). 
The device is battery -operated. We will provide you with separate instructions about how 
to operate the device and how to charge the battery.

1007377-[ADDRESS_717717] will determine whether you can tak e the device home, based on his/her 
assessment of your ability to operate and use the device correctly. If you cannot use the 
device sufficiently well, you will not be allowed to take it home.  
 
Use of collision warning device at home  
If you are permitted t o take the device home, we will ask you to use it as much as 
possible when walking indoors and outdoors for approximately 2 months. In order to 
evaluate how helpful the collision warnings are, the device will sometimes go into a 
“silent” mode where no warn ings will be given. The device will not give any indication 
of when it is in the “silent” mode. Therefore you should always be vigilant about 
collision hazards. The device will not warn you of all potential collision hazards because 
it will sometimes be in  the “silent” mode and because it is a prototype device.  
 
In the “active” mode the device will give warnings of the direction of potential obstacles 
and the collision risk to help you avoid contact [CONTACT_548303]. When the 
device does give a warnin g, you should make use of the warning to avoid a collision. You 
will be instructed to cover the camera for a few seconds  every time when a collision 
incident occurs. You will be given instructions to take home on how to use the device. 
The device will auto matically record video snapshots of all potential and actual collisions 
that happen. We will use a computer algorithm to automatically detect any faces in the 
snapshots and mask them so that they will be unrecognizable to preserve anonymity.  
 
An investigat or will call you every  week after you take the device home to check on your 
progress with the device.   
 
Questionnaires  
At the first and last visits we will ask you to complete a questionnaire about your 
mobility  and the difficulties you encounter when walking around . At the final visit we 
will also ask you to complete a questionnaire about the device so that you can give us 
your feedback and comments.

 Indoor obstacle course  
At the final visit you might  be asked to complete an indoor obstacle course. The course 
will be set up in our large conference room using soft and light obstacles. One of the 
investigators may also be a moving obstacle which you will be asked to yield to. He will 
ensure that you do not colli de. You will be asked to walk through the obstacle course 
from start to finish once with the device and once without the device. While walking 
through the obstacle course you might also be asked to perform a secondary task recalling 
numbers you hear presen ted through headphones. The assessment will be video recorded 
in order to check the scoring of collisions and performance in the secondary task. Once 
the data is obtained from the video, the recording will be deleted.  
 
What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study?  
 
Vision testing  
The vision testing includes standard clinical tests carried out in an eye doctor’s office. 
There might be slight discomfort during the visual fields test as you will have your chin 
in a chin re st. We will set the height of the rest so that it is comfortable for you.  
 
Collision warning device  
The risk of bumpi[INVESTIGATOR_548300] d aily activities. In the 
active mode, the device provides warnings to alert you to potential collision obstacles 
while you are walking. In the silent mode it does not provide any warnings. Therefore 
you should always be vigilant about collision hazards. The  device will not warn you 
of all obstacles because it will sometimes be in the silent mode  and because it is a 
prototype device.  
 
You will be given training in how to use the device by [CONTACT_548304]. We will give you detailed instructions about how to operate the 
device. We recommend that you start by [CONTACT_548305] a familiar 
environment until you feel confident about  using it. You should continue to use any 
spectacles, visual aids (e.g. a telescope) or mobility devices (e.g., a long cane) that you 
normally use when walking around. The collision warning device is not meant to be a 
replacement for any of your existing g lasses or devices.

 Indoor Obstacle course  
Potential risk when walking through the obstacle course is no greater than when walking 
in a crowded environment. Obstacles will be light, soft and not fixed on the floor. 
Kicking or colliding with them will only cause them to move, and you will not get 
injured. To minimize this risk, we will allow you to practice in a small scale obstacle 
course until you are comfortable with the task. Also an investigator will walk behind you 
to monitor your safety. His/her sole responsibility is to ensure your safety. A system of 
communication will be established between you and the “spotter” for any sudden stops 
that are necessary.  
 
There are no known risks to videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_548301].  
 
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?  
 
You will not be able to keep the device at the end of the study. However, you might 
benefit from the training aimed to help you use the device and improve your mobility. 
The information learned during the study will provide important insights about the abilit y 
of the device to assist people with vision loss to avoid potential obstacles. Your feedback 
may also make it possible to improve the design of the collision warning device.  
 
Can I decide to stop taking part in this study?  
 
Your taking part in this resear ch study is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the 
study even after signing this consent.  You may stop your participation or withdraw from 
the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits. The quality of care you will 
receive will not be affecte d in any way if you decide not to participate or if you withdraw 
from the study.  
 
Will I be paid to take part in this research study?  
 
You may be reimbursed for your time at $15 per hour for study visits . You may also be 
reimbursed for travel expenses if y ou travel specifically for the study to the Schepens Eye 
Research Institute (not to exceed $50 per visit). There are no costs to you for participating 
in the study.  
 
What happens if I am injured as result of taking part in this research study?  
 
Injuries sometimes happen in research even when no one is at fault. There are no plans to 
pay you or give you other compensation for any injuries.  You are not giving up any of 
your legal rights by [CONTACT_3368].

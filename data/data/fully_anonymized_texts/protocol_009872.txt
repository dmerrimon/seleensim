1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
A growing number of Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064] (ARF) survivors are burdened by [CONTACT_809461]. Notably, depressive symptoms are independently associated with subsequent development of new impairments in physical functioning. There are no randomized control led trials (RCT), in 
ARF survivors, evaluating any intervention for depression. To improve mental and physical health outcomes in ARF survivors, the following gaps within existing patient -oriented research 
must be addressed: 1) interventions to improve depressive symptoms and associated physical 
functioning impairments, 2) evaluation of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for depressive 
symptoms, and 3) validation of screening instruments to assess depressive symptoms. This K23 application, by [CONTACT_809462], MD, aims to address these gaps by [CONTACT_809463] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (Aim 1) of an intervention combining Behavioral Activation and physical rehabilitation (delivered via telephone and 2 home visits over 12- weeks) versus a “usual care” 
control group, and evaluating its feasibility (primary outcome) and efficacy to reduce depressive symptoms and improve physical functioning (secondary outcomes). Behavioral Activation, as proposed for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], is an evidence -based  psychological treatment for 
depressi on, which increases adaptive behaviors to achieve patient -valued goals. This project 
will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the BA -R intervention both quantitatively and 
qualitatively, through semi -structured interviews. Using the combined patient c ohort from the 
intervention and control groups of the RCT, [CONTACT_208135] also will evaluate modifiable psychosocial risk factors for depressive symptoms in ARF survivors and the association between the intervention and these modifiable factors (Aim 2), and the measurement properties of two commonly used depression screening instruments in ARF survivors versus a “gold standard” clinician diagnostic interview that she will be trained to perform (Aim 3).

 2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary obj ectives)  
 
Aim 1: To conduct a single -site, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (N= 54) evaluating the feasibility (primary objective) and 
efficacy (secondary objective) of a 12- week behavioral activation- rehabilitation (BA -R) intervention versus 
“usual care”, in acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (ARF) survivors.  
Hypothesis 1a:  A 12 -week BA- R intervention in ARF survivors will be feasible, as demonstrated  
by [CONTACT_809464] 1.5 patients per month, completion of > 80% of the 12- week phone calls, and 
<15% of enrolled patients lost to follow -up at the end of the 12- week intervention.  
Hypothesis 1b:  At the end of the 12- week BA- R intervention, ARF survivors in the BA -R versus “usual 
care” group will demonstrate decreased depressive symptoms, less impairments in physical function and 
quality of life, and reduced healthcare utilization  
Hypothesis 1c:  We will conduct qualitative research, using thematic analysis, t o identify key barriers and 
facilitators to engaging with the BA -R intervention, as well as perceived satisfaction, acceptabilit y and 
feasibility of BA -R. 
 
Aim 2: To evaluate the association between resilience, copi[INVESTIGATOR_809429] -R intervention among at -risk ARF 
survivors from Aim 1.  
Hypothesis 2a: Increased resilience, adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and social engagement  are associated with fewer 
depressive symptoms using the combined patient cohort from the BA -R and control groups in Aim 1  
Hypothesis 2b:  At the end of the 12- week intervention, ARF survivors in the BA -R versus “usual care” 
control group will demonstrate improvements in copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], resilience and social engagement . 
Hypothesis 2c: We will conduct qualitative research, using thematic analysis,  to identify the role of 
resilience, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and social en gagement  in recovery from ARF.  
 
Aim 3: To evaluate measurement properties (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive 
values) of two commonly- used depression screening instruments (i.e., Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226467] (HADS) and Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale- 8 (PHQ- 8)) for detecting depressive 
symptom severity using a “gold standard” depression measure (i.e., Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5
th Edition (SCI D-5)), in at -risk ARF survivors from 
Aim 1.  
Hypothesis 3:  The HADS and PHQ- 8 will adequately discriminate depressive symptom severity compared 
to the SCID -5 “gold standard” using the combined patient cohort from the BA -R and control groups in  
Aim 1.  
  
3. Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  Annually, >750,[ADDRESS_1119317] acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_315037] 
(ARF) requiring mechanical ventilation.1-3 As the population ages, the incidence of ARF is increasing, with 
a projected 80% rise by 2026.4,5 At the same time, due to medical advances, ARF survival is improving,6 
leading to a growing number of survivors who frequently experience significant psychological sequelae (e.g., depression)
7 and physical morbidities (e.g., impairments in physical functioning).8-12 After ARF, the 
cumulative incidences, over 2 years, of new depressive symptoms and impairment physical functioning are 
40% and 66%, respectively.10 Psychological and physical impairments may synergistically yield worse 
outcomes,13 with ARF research, conducted by [CONTACT_809465], showing depressive sympt oms are an 
independent risk factor for new onset of impaired physical functioning.10 
 As part of the scientific premise for this proposal, prior work, conducted by [CONTACT_3252] -mentor, Mark Hegel, 
PhD, showed that only treating depression in other medically ill populations with functional impairments is 
NOT sufficient to achieve optimal improvement in patient outcomes. With depressed, medically ill older

 adult outpatients, there were improvements in emotional outcomes, without improvements in physical 
functioning.14 In a depression prevention study in older adults with low vision, depression incidence was 
halved at 2 -month follow up, but the benefit was not maintained at 6 months.15 However, a depression 
prevention study that included BOTH a  depression treatment (Behavioral Activation (BA)) and an 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT) rehabilitation intervention again halved the incidence of depression that was then sustained for [ADDRESS_1119318] evaluate d important psychosocial factors, such as social 
engagament ,17-20 resilience21-24 and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007],18,25-29 that may be important in designing interventions. 
Moreover, a “gold standard” depression diagnostic outcome measure is not feasible for large studies,7,[ADDRESS_1119319] a “gold standard” clinician 
diagnostic interview in ARF survivors.31 
          The urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors for depressive symptoms and develop new strategies that address the multi -faceted nature of impairments after ARF has been recognized by [CONTACT_809466].
13,32 Further, as per the NHLBI’s new 
Strategic Vision, there is a need to develop interventions, within a multidisciplinary framework, to facilitate behavioral modification for disease treatment and incorporate such interventions into c ommunity- level 
patient care.

SCIENTIFIC PREMISE:   Gaps in Existing Literature on Risk Factors for Depressive Symptoms in ARF 
Survivors: Resilience,34,[ADDRESS_1119320] a “Gold Standard” in ARF Survivors: A recent 
Scopi[INVESTIGATOR_809430] (HADS)
[ADDRESS_1119321] common depression instrument (60% of ARF studies).30 The Personal Health 
Questionnaire -9 (PHQ- 9), likewise, is widely used both cl inically and in research studies.[ADDRESS_1119322] a 
“gold standard” c linician diagnostic interview in ARF survivors. Importantly, ARF patients may differ 
from other populations in etiology and manifestations of depressive symptoms given the potential 
contribution of co- morbidities50 and the physiologic stress of critical illness (e.g., prolonged inflammatory 
state).7 Indeed, our systematic review demonstrated that traditional risk factors for depressive symptoms in 
the general population (e.g. sex) did not apply to ARF s urvivors, suggesting that other factors, such as 
neuro- inflammation, might play a larger role in these patients.7 These issues make validation51 of 
depressive screening instruments in this unique ARF survivor population essential to the validity of future 
research in the field.  
 
Strengths and weaknesses of Exis ting Research in ARF Survivors: Compared to the large number of studies 
describing impairments in ARF survivors, a systematic review reported that the number of interventional studies is modest, and interventions with proven effects are “rare.”
52,53 Recent systematic reviews 
demonstrate there are no existing trials specifically evaluating evidence -based depressio n interventions and 
only one54 evaluating a combined psychological/physical intervention in ARF.7,52,53,55,56

treatment (8 weeks), with little change at [ADDRESS_1119325] (primary outcome) or quality of life at discharge, 3, 6, or 12 month 
follow -up.58 Adherence with the outpatient rehabilitation intervention was poor (41%) and investigators 
hypothes ized that (1) a home -based (vs. clinic- based) intervention may be superior to improve adherence 
and (2) failure to address psychological problems contributed to null results. Finally, the authors suggested 
that future studies use outcome measures focused o n participation restrictions in the home (e.g. patient -
reported physical function), which may demonstrate treatment effects beyond standardized performance -
based physical measures (e.g., [ADDRESS_1119326]). Third, a [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) trial,54 which 
randomized patients to a rehabilitation manual vs usual care, demonstrated better quality of life scores (via 
SF-36 survey) at the end of the 6- week intervention. However, there was no difference in depressive 
symptoms between the two groups. Given vastly lower access to outpatient physical rehabilitation, as part 
of “usual care” in the [LOCATION_006] vs. [LOCATION_003], these results are not generalizable to the [LOCATION_003] setting.  
 Lack of Clinical  Trials Demonstrating Effective Interventions to Improve Depressive Symptoms in ARF: In 
a systematic review by [CONTACT_27156], there was a paucity of clinical trials evaluating an intervention specifically to reduce depressive symptoms in ARF survivors,
[ADDRESS_1119327] -ICU outpatient physical rehabilitation interventions to improve depressive symptoms in 
ARF survivors.  
 
Behavioral Activation is Effective & Accessible Treatment for Depression : For depression, behavioral 
activation (BA) is the primary behavioral treatment within the class of evidence -based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_809431].59,60 BA the ory holds that inadequate environmental reinforcement 
(i.e., behaviors leading to positive or desired outcomes) and/or too much environmental punishment (i.e., 
behaviors leading to aversive or undesired outcomes), can contribute to depression via extinction of 
adaptive behaviors and avoidance of taking action.60,61 BA addresses these issues by “activating” depressed 
persons to re -engage with their environments. BA interventions for depression have shown large effect 
sizes (e.g., 0.87).62 BA is superior to cognitive therapy (the most widely studied psychotherapy for 
depression) with compar able effect to antidepressant medication, even for severely depressed patients.63 
Moreover, these positive effects of BA were retained 2 years later and comparable to continued medication 
treatment.64 Finally, BA is time -efficient, not requiring advanced skills or complex training, making BA 
suitable for wide -scale dissem ination.62  For additional SCIENTIFIC PREMISE,  see Section 3.1  
 Summary of Significance: Given the increasing number of ARF survivors, and associated public health 
burden due to long- lasting mental and physical impairments, research evaluating modifiable psychosocial 
risk factors and establishing val idated screening instruments for future research is a priority as per the 
American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine and NHLBI’s strategic vision. Moreover, 
designing effective interventions to address co -existing, long- lasting psychologi cal and physical 
impairments is essential to enhancing recovery in ARF survivors as per existing literature. Existing studies 
are limited, focused primarily on physical interventions, and not demonstrating efficacy. Improving 
existing interventions by [CONTACT_809467], physical functioning AND adaptation to ARF 
survivorship is a key component missing in prior studies; the proposed BA -R intervention addresses this 
gap.

physical impairments.72-75 Importantly, our recent systematic and scopi[INVESTIGATOR_809432]: 1) modifiable risk factors (e.g. resilience, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) for depressive symptoms,
7 2) consensus regarding depression screening instruments,30 and 3) comparison of any 
depression screening instrument against a “gold standard” diagnostic interview.31 Our research 
demonstrated high prevalences of depressive symptoms and physical impairments after ARF (40% and 66%, respectively), and depressive symptoms are independently associated with new impairments in physical functioning (OR=2.7, P=0.02).

 Behavioral Intervention Research in Medical Populations: Mark Hegel, PhD  (co-mentor) previously 
designed a psychological intervention similar to the proposed BA intervention, called Problem Solving 
Therapy (PST), administered by [CONTACT_508287],
[ADDRESS_1119329] geriatric depression treatment trial 
(N=1801): Project IMPACT.[ADDRESS_1119330] (vs. a community- based therapy control) showed 
significantly improved depressive symptoms at [ADDRESS_1119331] via Skype (Tele -PST) to homebound elders with 
depression, showing that Tele -PST was highly acceptable.80-82 This evidence sh ows that this intervention, 
that is closely related to BA, is effective in adults with medical co -morbidities and functional impairment, 
when administered in -person, by [CONTACT_809468]. These studies demonstrate our group’s proficiency 
with conducting RC Ts of psychosocial, phone -assisted interventions. Drs. Hegel and Lyons (co -mentors) 
also conducted research integrating Behavioral Activation with PST and occupational therapy (OT) interventions (BA -Rehabilitation or BA -R) for cancer survivors
83-86 and for older adults with macular 
degeneration.16 The following theories provide the foundation for the prior research: (1) OT, which 
emphasizes participation in daily activities, is synergistic with BA and PST, (2) having BA provided by [CONTACT_809469]- mental health providers expands i ts accessibility (BA requires less psychotherapeutic 
expertise than PST), and (3) the unique treatment focus of OT may extend the effectiveness of BA for improving both psychological and physical functioning.

a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures  (distinguish research 
procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
Overview of Research Methods for Aims 1, 2, & 3  
A single cohort of patients will be used for all 3 Aims (i.e. both intervention and control  groups recruited 
into the randomized controlled trial (RCT) will form a single cohort for analyses in Aims 2 and 3).  We will 
enroll [ADDRESS_1119332] to follow -up, we will 
enroll up to 10 additional patients to obtain 12 -week outcomes assessments on a total of 54 patients (27 in 
each group). Oral informed consent  will be obtained from  all participants.  
 Aim 1 Methods: We will conduct a single -site, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (N= 54) evaluating the feasibility (prim ary 
objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) of a 12 -week behavioral activation- rehabilitation (BA -R) 
intervention versus “usual care”, in acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (ARF) survivors.  We will evaluate the BA -R 
intervention via an RCT study design, with blinded outcome assessments. We will test the feasibility of this intervention (primary outcome) and its effica cy (secondary outcome) at the end of intervention. Figure 2 
shows study timeline.  
 After return home, consented patients will be randomized to: (1) behavioral activation and rehabilitation 
(BA- R) intervention or  usual care. Randomization will occur via web -based tool, using variable -sized

Physical and Occupational Therapy Initial Home Visits: Within about [ADDRESS_1119333] (PT) and occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT). 
The PT will (1) assess home safety, (2) recommend environmental modifications (e.g., grab bars) and (3) 
when indicated, use standardized, validated and feasible tests for ICU survivors to assess stren gth (via 
manual muscle testing)9,73 and mobility (via 4 meter timed walk).100 Given current restrictions (as of March

 13, 2020) due to the coronavirus pandemic, home visits have been converted to audiovisual visits. The PT 
will provide resources to obtain low cost equipment (e.g., walkers), if required. In both groups, acute need 
for PT/OT services will be as per standard of care (i.e., physician referral); study participation (in either 
randomized group) will not impact standard care. The OT will then assist the patient in  identifying  valued 
activities (i.e., activities performed for their intrinsic worth) in the participant’s life . The OT will guide and 
facilitate de velopi[INVESTIGATOR_809437], based on ratings of importance and satisfaction 
with performance  on the COPM and performed in the participant’s home, by [CONTACT_281114]. The 
OT will then evaluate the participant's ability to perform the prioritized activities. The  OT will work with 
the participant to set BA goals for these selected activities, by [CONTACT_809471] (as 
recommended by [CONTACT_6214]) into valued daily routines. Goals will be divided into step- by-step plans, which 
incorporate appropriate expectations for participant activity during recovery. If the necessary steps to 
achieve thes e goals are not readily apparent to the participant, the OT will implement standard problem -
solving strategies.16,83,85 The visit will end with the OT entering the identified goals for the valued activities 
into the participant’s Progress Worksheet (see below).  
 BA-R Phone intervention:  WEEKS 1 -6: Approximately one week after the OT home visit, and weekly 
thereafter throughout the initial 6 -week intervention period, the participant will receive a phone call from 
the OT. During each call, the OT will query participants’ success with BA -R goals and adherence barriers 
(e.g., need for assistance, lack of motivation). If goals are met, the OT will help the participant establish goals for the next week, and these goals along with an action plan will be delineated in a Progress Worksheet. If the goals are not met, the OT w ill assist the participant in addressing barriers as detailed 
above. WEEKS 7- 12: At about [ADDRESS_1119334] a second audiovisual  visit. Given current 
restrictions (as of March 13, 2020) due to the coronavirus pandemic, home visits have been converted to audiovisual visits. The PT will assess if the exercise level should be changed (e.g., increase or decrease 
intensity/duration). The OT will review progress on the action plan. Depending on achievement, participant preferences, and recovery traject ory, the OT  and participant will develop new goals for participating in 
valued activities over the next [ADDRESS_1119335].  
 Usual Care Control Group:  Participants randomized to this arm will receive usual care only, in order to reflect a real -world comparator. This group is expected to include primary care, possibly outpatient 
physical therapy, mental health, and ho me health nurses. As per Table 2 , these data will be collected to 
describe usual care received by [CONTACT_809472]. These same data also will be collected for the intervention group to characterize usual care received outside of the BA -R intervention. These data will be 
recorded from the time of enrollment until end of the intervention.

respectively) and the questions will be iteratively refined throughout the study period in order to optimize 
information gained about themes as they arise. The interviews will begin with open- ended questions about 
patient experiences in recovery after ARF. Broad questions will then be followed by [CONTACT_809473]: 1) resilience, copi[INVESTIGATOR_809438] ; 2) key barriers and facilitators to engag ing 
with the BA -R intervention; and 3) perceived satisfaction, acceptability and feasibility of BA -R. The 
anticipated duration is 25- 30 minutes per interview.  
 Methods for Aim 3:  The 3 instruments required for Aim 3 ar e described in Table 4 and under Secondary

c. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.  
 Participants cannot be blinded to the intervention.  Treatment allocation will be concealed, except to staff 
performing the intervention. R esearch staff performing all outcome assessments will be blinded  (except [CONTACT_809487] who will not be masked to treatment assignment and will administer the SCID). Patients will be 
instructed (using standard language, as per prior research)
101-103 not to discuss treatment all ocation with 
staff prior to each  assessment. Adequacy of blinding will be assessed by [CONTACT_809475] -blinded and for  their “best guess” of patients’ treatment allocation.[ADDRESS_1119338] a “usual care”, rather than a sham control that would attempt

a. Primary outcome variable.  
 
The primary outcome variable is feasibility. We will assess the total number of intervention phone calls completed per patient as a proportion of the number of intervention phone calls each patient is intended to complete (i.e., 9 intervention calls –  weekly during first 6 weeks and bi -weekly for second 6 weeks of the 
12-week protocol). We also will assess total number of intervention phone calls completed by [CONTACT_809477] a proportion of total intervention phone calls expected in the study (i.e., 9 calls/patient x 27 intervention patients = 243 calls). We will calculate the number of patients completing the 12- week  follow -
up session as a proportion of the number of patients enrolled to measure of loss to follow -up. 
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] ( HADS)
45: The HADS (Tables 1  and 4), separately assesses 
depressive and anxiety symptoms in a wide variety of patients, is valid, reliable45,56,65,105,106 and highly 
correlated with psychiatric evaluation in other populations,107 but never validated in ARF survivors. A 
HADS score ≥8 indicates clinic ally important depressive symptoms. Scores of 8 -10 indicates “mild” 
symptoms, 11- 14 “moderate”, and ≥15 “severe”. HADS is the most commonly used measure of depressive 
symptoms in ARF survivors10,56,108 and is considered to be particularly appropriate in ARF patients because

c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis. 
 Sample Size
: As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], we aim to enroll a convenience sample of ~1.5 patients/month, for a total of 
54 patients ( based on 36 months of recruitment; see Timeline -Candidate Statement). Extensive experience 
enrolling ARF patients in prior studies by [CONTACT_27156]10,121,125-[ADDRESS_1119345] an overall <15% missing completion rate due to mortality and loss to follow-up (in our prior study of >500 ARF survivors, loss to follow -up was 2% with 7% mortality at 6 
months
125), thus, we expect 54 patients to complete the inter vention. With 54 participants (27 in each 
group), assuming 5% alpha, 80% power and HAD SD of 4.[ADDRESS_1119346] a 3.1 point difference in HADS score 
between the 2 treatment groups, which approximates HAD’s 2.9 point minimum important difference 
(MID) in ARF survivors,128 This proposed enrollment rate and sample size is consistent with existing 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility trials in ARF research.101,129,130 
 
Statistical Analysis  
Hypothesis 1a:  A 12 -week BA -R intervention in ARF survivors will be feasible, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_809479] 1.5 patients per month, completion of >80% of the intervention phone calls, and 
<15% of enrolled patients lost to follow -up for outcomes assessments at end of the 12 -week intervention. 
We will assess the total number of intervention phone calls completed per patient as a proportion of the number of intervention phone calls each patient is intended to complete (i.e., 9 intervention calls – weekly 
during first 6 weeks and bi -weekly  for second 6 weeks of the 12- week protocol). We also will assess total 
number of intervention phone calls completed by [CONTACT_809480] a proportion of total intervention phone calls expected in the study. We will calculate the number of patients  completing the 12- month 
follow -up session as a proportion of the number of patients enrolled to measure loss to follow -up.  
 
Hypothesis 1b:  At the end of the 12 -week BA -R intervention, ARF survivors in the BA -R versus “usual 
care” group will demonstrate d ecreased depressive symptoms, less impairments in physical function and 
quality of life, and reduced healthcare utilization.  Analyses will follow a modified intention -to-treat 
principle  and a  2-tailed p<0.05 is statistically significant. Patient mortality is expected to occur infrequently 
(see Sample Size above) and not to differ by [CONTACT_809481]. control group; therefore, all analyses will be conducted for 12- week survivors only. The analysis will include separate comparisons of the effect of the 
BA-R intervention vs usual care control on each of the blinded outcomes in Table 4. These analyses will 
estimate the average treatment effect, i.e. the difference in the mean 12 -week outcome comparing the BA -R 
intervention to the usual care control, using the precis e locally efficient augmented simple estimator 
(PLEASE) described in Colantuoni and Rosenblum[REF: 135]. This method for estimating the average 
 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1119347] is similar to the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach in that it incorporates the 
baseline outcome (if measured) which, if correlated with the 12- week outcome, can improve the precision 
of the estimated average treatment effect [Ref 134].  This method also accounts for more general patient 
drop- out models than the ANCOVA approach. Specifically, the ANCOVA approach is valid under 
completely at random drop- out, whereas the PLEASE is valid under missing at random drop- out, i.e. when 
patient drop -out differs by [CONTACT_809482]. The PLEASE requires a priori specification of three models: an outcome regression model (fit separately for each treatment group) that will include age, gender and the baseline outcome (if measured), a propensity score model that will include age, gender and the baseline outcome (if measured) and a drop- out model (fit separately for each treatment group) that will include age, gender, and the 
outcomes measured at baseline (HADS, Brief Cope, CD RISC, BADS). As exploratory analyses, the 12-week outcom es (e.g. HADS scores) will be summarized (summary statistics including counts of missing 
values and histograms) and the correlation of the baseline (if appropriate) and 12- week outcomes will be 
computed, separately by [CONTACT_2939].  Patient mortality, dro p-out and missing data will be described for 
all variables, separately for treatment vs control groups. Patient characteristics will be compared between those with vs. without missing outcomes (due to drop- out and missing values).
136-[ADDRESS_1119348] of the BA -R intervention.  Specifically, the 
outcomes over time within each treatment group will be visualized using spaghetti plots to dis play each 
patient's data with the mean outcome over time trajectory over time highlighted.  Longitudinal linear regression models for the longitudinal outcomes (i.e. baseline, 6- week and 12- week outcomes) will be 
constructed that account for time (factor),  treatment and the interaction of treatment and time.   These 
longitudinal models will be fit using weighted least squares and will allow for the possibility that the 
variance in the outcomes can change over time and that outcomes measured on the same patient over time 
may be correlated.   In addition, w e will explore the prognostic ability of other baseline variables (e.g. age, 
sex and history of depression) for the 12- week outcomes using the method described by [CONTACT_809483].
[ADDRESS_1119349] -one-out cross -validated relative R -square which 
compares the  R -square obtained when modeling the 12- week outcomes as a function of selected baseline 
variables, separately for each treatment arm, to that obtained by [CONTACT_809484] 12- week outcomes with the 
treatment arm specific mean.  The statistic (1 – 1/relative R -square) is roughly the sample siz e reduction 
that can be achieved if the selected baseline variables are incorporated into an adjusted treatment effect estimator compared to using an unadjusted estimator.  This assessment will provide relevant information to improve the design and analysi s of subsequent larger randomized trials evaluating the effect of the BA -R 
intervention; specifically, by [CONTACT_809485].  
 
Hypothesis 1c:  We will conduct qualitative research, using thematic analysis, to identify key barriers and 
facilitators to engaging with the BA -R intervention, as well as perceived satisfaction, acceptability and 
feasibility of B A-R. All interviews will be audio recorded using a digital recorder and subsequently 
transcribed on a rolling basis. Using a data -driven approach, the first five interviews and associated 
interviewer field notes will be independently read by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Parker and a second coder with expertise in 
qualitative research methods. The data will be segmented by [CONTACT_809486] (codes) to the patterns that emerge. Following the revie w of the five initial interviews, the two investigators will meet to discuss common 
findings and key themes. A code book will then be developed to guide the analysis of the transcripts through an iterative process of discussion and review. Transcripts will  be reviewed on an ongoing basis to 
identify when thematic saturation is reached, defined by [CONTACT_2669] 3 interviews without additional information. Nvivo software will be used to organize the data for analysis. Coding will be compared

 between the coders usi ng percentage agreement and Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Discrepancies will be 
reviewed and resolved through discussion between reviewers and a th ird review , if needed.  
 
Hypothesis 2a:  Increased resilience, adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and social engage ment  are associat ed with fewer 
depressive symptoms using the combined patient cohort from the BA -R and control groups in Aim 1. Our 
primary outcome is depressive symptoms from the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809443] (HADS). First, 
descriptive statistics (i.e. mean, stand ard deviation, histograms) will be performed for the baseline HADS 
and the exposure and confounding variables. Next, a bi -variable analysis will be conducted for the HADS 
vs the baseline exposure variables for Aim 1 (i.e., CD -RISC 10, Brief COPE, BADS) usi ng linear 
regression. In multivariable analyses, we also will include potentia l confounding variables (Table 1), 
including no more than 4 covariates in each model to avoid overfitting with sample size 54 (after 
accounting for mortality and loss to follow -up). These analyses will be conducted for all patients in the 
combined cohort in Aim 1.  
 
Hypothesis 2b:  At the end of the 12 -week intervention, ARF survivors in the BA -R versus “usual care” 
control group will demonstrate improvements in copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], resilience and social engagement . Analyses for 
the comparison between the intervention and usual care groups  will follow a modified intention -to-treat 
principle, with a  2-tailed p<0.05 is considered significant. Analysis will include separate comparisons of 
the interv ention vs control for each of outcomes (Brief Cope, CD RISC, BADS), in accordance with the 
description above for  Hypothesis 1b.  
 
Hypothesis 2c:  We will conduct qualitative research, using thematic analysis, to identify the role of 
resilience, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and social engagement in recovery from ARF.  See analysis plan above for Hypothesis 
1c. This analysis will include all patients in the combined cohort from Aim 1.  
 
Hypothesis 3:  The HADS and PHQ -8 will adequately discriminate depressive symptom severity vs. the 
SCID- 5 “gold standard” using the combined patient cohort from the BA -R and control groups in Aim 1. 
All analyses will be conducted using only the [ADDRESS_1119350] inclusion criteria (in Aim 
1), which establish the patient cohort for Aim 3, i nclude only patients with PHQ- 2 ≥2 (i.e., at least mild 
depressive symptoms). Therefore, for Aim 3 analyses, we will categorize depressive symptoms based on 
severity category for the SCID -5 (mild vs moderate to severe ). We will then examine  the screening 
characteristics of HADS and PHQ8 total scores  vs the SCID -5 using a receiver operating characteristics 
(ROC) curve, including the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and sensitivities, specificities, and positive 
and negative predictive values at each HADS and PHQ8  total- score cut point . Our sample size (N=54 
patients)  is adequate to permit an assessment of criterion validity that is rated, at least, as “good” quality 
according to the COSMIN standard for psychometric analyses.131 In addition to assessment of criterion 
validity, we will assess internal consistency of the PHQ -8 using Chronbach’s alpha, with a result of > 0.7 
and <0.95 indicating “good” quality as per COSMIN132 (HADS has an existing publication demonstrating 
good internal consistency in ARF survivors so no such analysis will be repeated for HADS)133.  
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
 
There will be no interim analyses to determine early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_809444]. The primary outcome for this study is feasibility.  
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 1) Depression:  Participants will be asked questions about depression using the PHQ -8, HADS and the 
SCID. While asking questions, we may detect that the patient has worsening depressive symptoms.

 2) Breach of confidentiality: We will be collecting data about the participant , and hence, there is a risk of 
breach of confidentiality.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
 Depression (PHQ -8, HADS and SCID) : All potential participants who have worsening depression 
symptoms will be informed that they may be depressed and advised to consult with their health care provider.  
 If there is any potential concern regarding safety of a participant, a physician on our st udy team will 
become involved. The research assistant will be instructed to take the steps outlined in Figure 2 below. 
− Complete a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAE) form documenting the outcome of this questionnaire 
and subsequent action taken. 
− If unsure a bout the patient’s risk, contact a study physician to notify them immediately and discuss 
action to take.

Breach of confidentiality : We will keep all participant infor mation confidential in accordance with Public 
Health Services Act (42 USC 299a- 1(c)).  There is a low  risk of a breach of confidentiality.   
 We will maintain subject confidentiality by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_809445]. Electronic data will be password protected with daily back up procedures.  Once data is entered into an analytic file, all identifying information will be removed.     
c. Plan for reporting unant icipated problems or study deviations.  
 The primary investigator ([CONTACT_208135]) is a board -certificated Internal Medicine physician practicing in the 
intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins. She will be involved in the daily conduct of the clinical trial and closely supervise the daily screening for patient eligibility, informed consent, and study procedures such as 
outcomes assessments and safety monitoring during the trial. Consequently, immediate knowledge of any unanticipated problem or study deviation that may arise will be available to the P.I. ([CONTACT_208135]) on a timely basis for immediate action and reporting to the IRB as necessary. If [CONTACT_208135] is unavailable, the study will maintain a list of clinicians who are co -mentors to [CONTACT_208135] on this study who can provide medical 
guidance.   
 If clinically important, unanticipated adverse problems or clinically important study -related, serious 
adverse events occur, they will be recorded on a designated case report form.  All events that are serious and unantici pated, or study- related and adverse will be reported to IRB within the required reporting 
timeline.  
 
Definitions:  
Adverse event: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered intervention related.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  - an adverse event will be considered "serious" if, in the view of the 
investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adverse reaction, re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapa city, or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 Suspected  Adverse Event  - any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event . 
 Unexpected Adverse Event  - an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, of an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consisten t with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
  
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
 All patient data will be confidential and secure d ue to physical and electronic data security measures, 
including locked offices and locked filing cabinets for records and computers, and password protection for computers and electronic data storage.  All participant -identifying information will be removed fro m the 
dataset before analysis. Only study staff who are required to, will know the linkage between the unique 
identifier and partic ipant -identifying information. We will keep all patient information confidential in

There are no expected financial risks to the participants.  
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society.  
 
Currently, there are few therapeutic options with proven, or potential, efficacy to prevent or minimize depressive symptoms in acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_512406] .  Hence, this study offers important new 
knowledge through testing the BA- R intervention i n this patient population. The BA -R intervention has 
been demonstrated to improve depressive symptoms in other chronically ill populations. Given the prevalence of depressive symptoms in acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_512406], gaining information regarding th e 
feasibility and potential benefit of BA-R in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_809446]. This therapy is especially

10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed 
bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol . 
 
For each assessment during the study, both int ervention and control group patients will be remunerated as 
follows: $25 for baseline assessment prior to intervention period, and $50 for assessment at the end of the intervention period.  
 
In addition, the intervention group only  will be remunerated $ 100 for completion of all intervention visits .   
 
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participant s and identify 
who will pay for them.  
 
There will not be any additional costs to participants beyond routine financial obligat ions for their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

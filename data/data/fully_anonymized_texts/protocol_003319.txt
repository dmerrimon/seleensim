A PHASE 2 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED,  
DOUBLE -MASKED CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE 
SAFETY AND EXPLORATORY EFFICACYOF LUMINATE® (ALG-1001) AS 
COMPARED TO AVASTIN®  
IN THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA 
 
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins and are important for cell- cell and 
cell-matrix interactions, which act as transmembrane linkers between their extracellular 
ligands and the cytoskeleton. Through the transmembrane links, integrins provide modulation of various outside-in and inside- out signaling pathways essential in the 
biological functions of cells such as: cell migration, differentiation, survival during embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, immune and non- immune defense 
mechanism, hemostasis and oncogenic transformation (Hynes RO., 2002).  
The molecular events involved in the development of NV and CNV have not been fully 
elucidated; however, while VEGF has been shown to play a major role in the 
development of NV and CNV (Umeda et. al., 2006; Friedlander et. al., 1996), integrins 
α
5β1, αvβ3, and α vβ5 are also implicated in the angiogenic process, and are known to be 
expressed in neovascular ocular tissue from patients with Wet AMD and proliferative D R 
(Umeda et. al., 2006; Friedlander et. al., 1996).  As shown in Figure [ADDRESS_669289] proliferation and invasion, as well as maturation and differentiation (Brooks et. al., 1996).

THE ANGIOGENIC CASCADE: TARGETING VEGF VS. INTEGRIN 

ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 11 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Allegro has developed an anti -integrin oligopeptide Luminate® as a first in class 
therapeutic for vascular eye diseases, including wet age- related macular degeneration 
(Wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and focal symptomatic vitreomacular 
traction (VMA) . Specifical ly, Allegro has discovered a peptide sequence , in either linear 
or cyclic form, that effectively binds to α 5β1, αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. These integrin 
receptors have been found to be intimately involved in the angiogenesis associated with Wet AMD, DME and proliferative DR.  DME is the leading cause of blindness in the working age population (www.diabetes.org). In the [LOCATION_002], 10.[ADDRESS_669290] been diagnosed with diabetes (www.diabetes.org), of which 4.[ADDRESS_669291] some form of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Further, the prevalence of DME in the U.S. approaches 30% in adults who have had diabetes for 20 years or more (Klein et. al., 1984).  DME is the result of thickening of the center part of the retina due to damage of retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_516371]. Application of laser to damaged capi[INVESTIGATOR_516372] 25 years (EDTRS Study Group, 1985; AAO 2009) . Recent results from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network 
demonstrated that in eyes with reduced visual acuity from DME involving the center of the macula, anti -VEGF therapy with Lucentis in combination with focal/grid laser  
provides superior vision outcomes and an acceptable safety profile compared with the previous standard treatment of laser (ETDRS Research Group, 1985).  Luminate
® solution for intravitreal injection approaches DME by [CONTACT_516404]; reducing the leakage of aberrant blood vessels; and inhibiting the growth of aberrant blood vessels. The most common treatment for DME is currently ranibizumab (Lucentis
®), aflibercept (Eylea®) and bevacizumab 
(Avastin®). All three of these options are anti- VEGF treatments, and are very large 
antibodies from 20KD to 150KD in size that bind to VEGF receptors . These antibodies 
must be administered at four to six week intervals for Avastin® and Lucentis® and every 
eight weeks for E ylea® at substantial inconvenience, cost, and cumulative risk of 
infection.   The use of Luminate
® solution for intravitreal injection has the potential to be both an 
effective stand -alone product as well as complementary to existing anti -VEGF treatments 
based on its unique mechanism of action and potentially longer duration of treatment 
effect as suggested in Phase 1 DME and wet AMD studies.  
 The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of Luminate
® in 
a DME population, as compared to treatment with Avastin .

PROTOCOL DME -202B 2. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4 doses of Luminate in 
a population of patients with active DME, and to compare the outcomes of Luminate 
treatment with Avastin treatment.  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a 2-stage, prospective, randomized, double- masked multicenter , Phase II clinical 
trial:   
Stage 1: One -hundred twenty (120) eligible subjects with active DME will be 
randomized to one of four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This includes 3 Luminate 
treatment groups (1.0 mg, 2.0 mg or 3.0 mg), and an Avastin® group. An active focal 
laser group was also present in previous versions of this protocol which has since been removed. At the time that this laser group was actively included in randomization, the randomization design had been a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio.     In addition to the study treatment (Luminate or Avastin with the treatments and  schedules 
defined below), during the course of follow-up, prn retreatment will be allowed for any subject with central subfield thickness ≥ [ADDRESS_669292] images by [CONTACT_516405].   Retreatment will be performed using the 
originally assigned treatment, i.e., Luminate with Luminate  and Avastin with Avastin . 
 
Stage 2 (select sites) : Seventy five (75) eligible subjects with active DME will be 
randomized to one of five treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_669293] of 2 Luminate treatment groups (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg), 2 Luminate and Avastin adjunctive treatment groups, and an Avastin® (1.25 mg) group. The Luminate monotherapy arms will also include an Avastin intravitreal injection at Week 0 
(Baseline).    
 In addition to the study treatment, during the course of follow-up for Stage [ADDRESS_669294] with central subfield thickness ≥ [ADDRESS_669295] who experiences a significant 
decrease in BCVA, as defined below:  
 
• BCVA loss of > [ADDRESS_669296] finding. 
OR 
• BCVA loss  of > [ADDRESS_669297] central retinal thickness of > 100 µm  as compared to the previous study 
visit based on the investigator’s judgment.

Group 4 Avastin 1.25 mg intravitreal injection administered at baseline (Day 0),  
weeks [ADDRESS_669302] 3 and up to 6 Avastin injections. Sham injections may be  
performed at weeks 12 , 16, and 20 if prn Avastin is not required . 
 An active focal laser  arm was also present in previous versions of this protocol which has 
since been removed. Any patients enrolled into the active laser group prior to approval of protocol amendment 2.64 will remain in that group and follow that applicable treatment schedule accordingly.  A table showing the four treatment arms  and visits is provided 
below, with the treatments to be administered at each visit.

6.3  INVESTIGATIONAL MATERIALS  
The investigational materials will be labeled by [CONTACT_516415], LLC , in a manner 
consistent with the study design.  The medications will be identified as an investigational 
compound and will carry the following statement: “CAUTION: NEW DRUG – LIMITED 
BY [CONTACT_516416]” .  The study code and subject 
number will be identified on the label of the medication bottles, along with the batch number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_516375].   The investigator or a qualified designee will be responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_516376], dispensed, and returned to the study site.  During the course of the study, the investigator must maintain an inventory of all study supplies in stock, as well as those dispensed and administered to study subjects.  The  
study drug must be stored in a secure area in order to prevent unauthorized distribution.  The investigational drug is to be administered only to subjects entered into the study, in accordance with the conditions specified in the protocol.   At the end of the study, and following a full accounting and recording of all study medications, unused supplies of the investigational products will either be returned to the 
Sponsor (or its designee) or disposed of under the direction of the Sponsor or designee.  The sponsor may authorize disposal of unused supplies of the investigational drug 
provided this alternative disposition does not expose humans to risks from the drug.

 6.4.2 Intravitreal Injection Preparation  – Avastin 
Avastin
® for intravitreal injection is supplied in a 1.0mL tuberculin syringe as a sterile 
liquid product ready for injection. Prior to the injection, the unmasked investigator should confirm the syringe volume and that the syringe to be used matches the randomization number specifically assigned to the particular study subject.   6.4.[ADDRESS_669318] in lay terms prior to beginning.  
 
• Apply one drop of brimonidine or similar IOP lowering agent ophthalmic drops to the eye to be injected.   
• Apply two (2) drops of proparacaine on the surface to be injected, followed by [CONTACT_1192] (2) drops of antibiotic.   
• To disinfect the periocular skin, eyelids, and lashes use 5% povidone iodine swabs in a systemic fashion.   
• The investigator wears gloves and a sterile drape is placed on the eye, then the lid 
speculum is placed over the drape. 
• The injection location is at the investigator ’s discretion, however the inferior 
temporal or superior temporal location is preferred.  
• Expel two (2) drops of 5% povidone iodine on the ocular surface.  Wait [ADDRESS_669319] over the injection site.  Expel excess  drug to 0.1 mL.   
• Insert the needle (30 or 31 gauge needle) 3.[ADDRESS_669320] slowly INTO THE CENTRAL VITREOUS (neither anterior nor posterior) and remove the needle from the eye slowly to avoid loss of drug.  Use the cotton swab as a tamponade to avoid loss of drug at injection site.  
• After injection, the investigator will observe the subject for several minutes to 
ensure that untoward complications have not occurred.   
• Check vision with finger counting and if vision is worse for more than 1 minute, an anterior chamber paracent esis with a 30 or 31- gauge needle should be 
performed .  
• The IOP can be taken at regular intervals, at the i nvestigator’s discretion, until the 
IOP has stabilized and the i nvestigator has determined that the subject is safe to 
leave the clinic.

6.6 RESCUE CRITERIA 
At study Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 ( for Stage 1  ONLY) rescue treatment is available for 
all groups should there be a significant decrease in BCVA.    Rescue is to be implemented at the discretion of the principal investigator [CONTACT_152561]: 
• BCVA loss of > [ADDRESS_669323] finding. 
OR 
• BCVA loss of > [ADDRESS_669324] central retinal  thickness of > 100 µm  as compared to the previous study 
visit based on the investigator’s judgment  
 If one of the above criteri a is met, rescue treatment may be given at the discretion of the 
unmasked Investigator but should not involve unmasking the subject or any additional staff.   
 If a subject meets  one of the above rescue criteri a and has not received the assigned study 
treatment in several weeks, Allegro recommends that the first option to be considered by 
[CONTACT_516417] ,   
 Avastin rescue is an other option, however since Avastin is a final option, any other 
necessary intervention to stabilize the subject should be considered.  Any subject who receives rescue treatment will continue to be followed for [ADDRESS_669325] ’s welfare may be 
used.  Additionally, topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]- inflammatories, antibiotics,  steroids, intraocular pressure 
agents, and/or cycloplegics to treat or assess the ocular condition may be used at the discretion of the investigator. All medications administered shall be reported in the 
appropriate section of the source document and electronic case report form ( eCRF). Any 
intravitreal injections in the study eye must be cleared by [CONTACT_516418].   
 Any intravitreal injections of anti -VEGF agents or intravitreal steroids IN THE 
NON-STUDY EYE must be administered at least 1 week  and preferably 2 week s 
after the STUDY EYE treatment or prior to the next scheduled study visit for the STUDY EYE .

an investigator decide to discontinue the study subject, based on clinical observations, this should be reported to the sponsor with reasons for the discontinuation.  Appropriate notification will be provided to the sponsor within approximately five working days.   
8.3
  TERMINATION OF STUDY OR PARTICIPATION BY A CLINICAL SITE OR 
SPONSOR 
The Sponsor or Clinical Site reserves the right to discontinue the study at a single site  
for safety or administrative reasons at any time.  If the Sponsor or Investigator 
discovers conditions during the study indicating that the study or participation by a clinical site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator.   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 37 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects 
enrolled in the study. 
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the study at any time.  
 
Conditions that warrant discontinuation of the study at a specific study site include: 
• Failure of the Investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable 
rate. 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the Protocol or pertinent 
regulations. 
• Submission by [CONTACT_516422]. 
 Any subject who completes all study visits will be considered to have completed the study.

associated with the use of an investigational drug  or other protocol- imposed intervention 
whether or not considered drug- related.   
 All treatment-emergent adverse events/adverse reactions occurring during the study should be recorded , regardless of the assumption of causal relationship.  If a subject has an 
ongoing adverse events/adverse reactions  at the time of study completion, the ongoing 
adverse events/adverse reactions  must be followed-up and provided appropriate medical 
care until the signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized.  
 Conditions or diseases that are chronic but stable should not be recorded on AE pages of the CRF.  Changes in a chronic condition of disease that are consistent with natural disease progression are NOT adverse events and also should not be recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.   
9.1
  ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
 Adverse event  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   Life-threatening  adverse event or life-t hreatening suspected adverse reaction . An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   Serious adverse event or suspected adverse reaction . An adverse event or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Inv estigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:   
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Results in a persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 39 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Sight-threatening adverse events include the following:  
• It caused a decrease in visual acuity of 30 ETDRS letters (compared with the 
last assessment of visual acuity prior to the most recent treatment) lasting >1 
hour. 
• It caused a decrease in visual acuity to the level of Light Perception or worse 
lasting >1 hour. 
• It required surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or 
biopsy with i ntravitreal injection of anti- infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy 
with gas) to prevent permanent loss of sight. 
• It is associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+ vitritis).  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it may require medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight. 
Sight-threatening events (as defined above) should be reported as SAEs. 
 
A non-serious adverse event is any AE that does not meet the definitions for SAEs as 
described above.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relations hip between 
the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the Inv estigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.   
9.2 C
LASSIFICATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS BY [CONTACT_516399] , SEVERITY AND ACTION 
TAKEN 
The study medication relationship for each adverse event/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_516425]: 
• Not Related:   The event is clearly  related to other factors  such as subject’s clinical 
condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease, therapy administered  or 
accidental trauma of  the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the 
product. 
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 40 
PROTOCOL DME -202B • Possibly Related:   The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study 
medication, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_81915]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject.  
• Related:  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration or placement and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_516426]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occur s immediately following study medication administration, or 
improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
 Intensity (severity)  of an adverse event is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level 
of discomfort of an adverse event as is determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The assessment of intensity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
1 = Mild:  present, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activity  
2 = Moderate:  discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity 
3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
 
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe or from severe to moderate.  In either case, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   Action taken in response to an adverse event is coded as:  
1=None 2=Test Article interrupted  
3=Test Article discontinued  
4=Non-drug therapy  
5=New OTC or Rx drug added 6=Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (< 24 hours) 7=Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (>= 24 hours) 
 Outcome of an adverse event is coded as : 
1=Recovered without sequelae  
2=Stable and ongoing 3=Ongoing 4=Death 
5=Unknown/ Lost to follow-up 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 41 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Please note: the term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity, see above) of an 
event/reaction; the event/reaction itself may be of relatively minor medical signif icance 
(such as severe headache).  This is not the same as a “Serious” Adverse Event, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to the subject’s life or vital functions.  “Serious” (NOT sev erity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
9.3
  ADVERSE EVENTS REQUIRING EXPEDITED REPORTING   
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) require expedited reporting to the Sponsor or designee regardless of relationship 
to study Insert or study procedure.   All SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported to the study Sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_18623]  
e-mail or fax within [ADDRESS_669340] an ongoing SAE or S[LOCATION_003]R at study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed by [CONTACT_516427], chronic, or stable by [CONTACT_737]. 
9.4  F
OLLOW-UP OF SUBJECTS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
If an adverse events/adverse reactions occu r, the Investigator will institute support and/or 
treatment as deemed appropriate.  If a non -SAE/adverse reaction  is unresolved at the time 
of the last visit, an effort will be made to follow up until the adverse event/adverse reaction 
is resolved or stabilized, the subject is los t to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the 
event.    
10 STATISTICS  
10.1
  SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS  
Since this is a Phase 2 exploratory clinical study, no formal hypothesis testing will be 
performed .  The sample size was determined based on establish ing a reasonable number of 
subjects to provide adequate safety and efficacy information to proceed to the next phase of 
clinical development.     
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 42 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 10.2  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Descriptive statistics will be used to tabulate and summarize study outcomes.   
Background and demographic characteristics will be presented.  Continuous variables will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (sample size, mean  and standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum).  Discrete variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_516428].  Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_216303].  Any other information collected (such as severity or relationship to study device) will be listed as appropriate.  Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only to highlight any interesting comparisons that may warrant further consideration. 
10.3
  ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The modified Intent t o Treat (mITT) data set will include all randomized subjects  who 
receive at least one dose of study drug and have at least one follow -up visit.  Last 
observation carry forward (LOCF) will be used to impute missing data from subjects.  If a 
subject receives rescue therapy, that subject’s worst reported value will be imputed for all 
subsequent visits. Data will be analyzed as randomized.   
 
The Per Protocol (PP) data set will include all subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the eligibility visit, who are compliant with all study requirements and who complete the study through Week s 20 and 24 (Stage 2 and Stage 1 respectively) .  
Missing data will not be imputed. Data recorded after rescue therapy will be excluded.  Data will be analyzed as treated.  
 The safety dataset will include all subjects who receive study drug.  Missing data will not 
be imputed.  Data will be analyzed as treated.

macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye from your diabetes). In this 
study 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mg of Luminate® will be co mpared to the current 
standards- of-care of 1.25mg Avastin.®   
 Luminate
® is an experimental product which has been tested in both animals 
and human patients in the past for safety and initial efficacy. In addition, improvements in vision and resolution of macular swelling have been 
observed in human subjects when the drug has been used alone.   
 You are being chosen for this study because your treating physician feels that your Diabetic Macular Edema (swelling in the back of the eye from your 
diabetes) is not resolved with the current standard of care medication (i.e., 
Avastin
®) or without further medical intervention. As the study drug, 
Luminate®, has a different mechanism of action,  meaning it works in a 
different way than the current standard of care drugs on the market, i t has 
been found in animal and other human studies to provide an additional level 
of benefit in treating bleeding disorders of the eye  above and beyond those 
benefits in vision or retinal anatomy seen with Avastin® (the current standard 
of care). Your participation in this study may directly benefit you by [CONTACT_516431] . 
  Luminate
® is experimental when used in the eye, such as for this use, and has 
not been approved by [CONTACT_2165].  The safety and efficacy of Luminate
® will be evaluated in this study.  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_669349] no other medical problems 
that would interfere with your participation in this study, and are not using any medications which might make your participation unsafe.  You will also receive an eye examination.  This exam includes:  
 Slit Lamp Exam  is an examination of your eye by [CONTACT_516432] a 
special microscope that allows your physician to see both the outside and the inside of your eye under magnification. The doctor will look at your pupil and eye movements. The lens and back of your  eye will also be examined after 
drops have been placed in your eyes to dilate your pupil. This exam will be performed on both eyes at the Screening Visit, but only on the study eye 
during all remaining visits.  
 
Fundus Exam  is an examination with an ophthalmoscope (an instrument with 
a strong light and a magnifying lens) of the interior lining of the eyeball, 
including the retina, optic disc (the head of the nerve to the eye), and the macula. This exam will be conducted by [CONTACT_516433]. This exam will be performed  on both eyes at the Screening Visit, but only on the study eye 
during all remaining visits. .  
 Intraocular Pressure  is a measure of the pressure of the fluid inside your eye. 
This exam will be performed on both eyes at the Screening Visit, but only on 
the study eye during all remaining visits.  
  Visual Acuity  uses letters projected on a screen to measure how well your eye 
can see at a specific distance. This exam will be performed on both eyes at the 
Screening Visit, but only on the study eye  during all remaining visits.   
  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)  uses light to measure the thickness of 
the retina. You may be familiar with ultrasound used to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_516379]. OCT uses light instead of sound to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_516380]. Like ultrasound, it is painless. You will be asked to look into the 
front of the OCT machine. While the instrument acquires an image, you will 
see lights of various colors. This exam will be performed on both eyes at the 
Screening V isit, but only on the study eye during all remaining visits.  
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE [ADDRESS_669350] in which pi[INVESTIGATOR_516381] a yellow  dye. The dye, called fluorescein, will be injected into a vein 
(blood vessel) in your arm or hand. This dye will travel through your blood 
vessels to your eyes. The camera will then flash a special light into your eye 
and will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_516382]; the pi[INVESTIGATOR_516383]. This test will be performed on both eyes at the Screening  Visit, and on the study eye on follow up visits.  
 Intravitreal Injection s will be given in one of your eyes (the “study eye”) 
within 20  days following your screening visit, and  at intervals during the 
course of the study . The pupil of your eye will be dilated, and your eye will be 
anesthetized (numbed). You will then receive an injection into your eye.  
 If you are a woman of childbearing potential (under age 60), you must have a 
negative pregnancy test to participate in this study.  
 
If you are eligible for the study, you will receive injections into your eye of 
1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mg of Luminate
®, or 1.25mg of Avastin®.  
 
The study drug will be drawn up into a small syringe and with your eye anesthetized (numbed), the drug will be injected into the white of the eye usually under the upper or lower lid.  There will be only a single  injection at 
Baseline.  
 Following the injections, you will need to return for additional examinations 
at study weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.   At these visits, you will have an eye 
examination.   
 If you decide to participate in the study, it is important that you return to the 
study site at the scheduled times for observation of your overall well- being.

What are the possible risks or discomforts?  
 
Risk of Eye Examination and Dilation  
As part of the eye exam, drops will be put in your eyes to dilate the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]. 
The drops may blur your vision and make you sensitive to light. The drops 
will wear off over several hours. There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to the drops. There is also a small risk that the drops could cause the eye pressure to rise. If this happens, it will be treated, but there is a very small risk of losing vision from the pressure rise. Due to the blurring effect on your vision and possible light sensitivity, you will be advised not to drive until the 
drops have worn off and, if necessary, have someone come with you who can 
drive after the exam.  
 Risk of Optical Coherence Tomography  
The vast majority of people feel no discomfort on exposure to the light source used to obtain the images of the retina.  However , as with any bright light 
source some people may experience photophobia (sensitivity to light).

Risks of Intravitreal Injection wit h Luminate® 
Luminate® has been tested in two previous human clinical trials and has been 
found to be safe and well tolerated. In this study, you will be examined for the 
need to receive Luminate® at monthly to quarterly intervals depending on the 
study arm you are enrolled into.  
 Prior to injection, your eye is numbed with an eye drop and it may be cleaned with betadine. You may experience redness or swelling of the eye or eyelid, or bleeding, tearing or watering of your eye. You may experience corneal 
abrasion (scratch on the clear front surface of the eye) if you rub your eye 
while numb. These events are likely to clear up quickly. You may experience an allergy to the numbing drops or betadine . This is usually treated by 
[CONTACT_516434]. 
 In clinical studies conducted with Luminate
® to date, the most common eye -
related side effects were: 
 
1. Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the clear covering of the eye)  
• Mild eye pain 
• Vitreous floaters (small specks floating in your field of vision)  
2. Transient i ncreased eye pressure  
• Vitreous detachment  (a common condition that occurs natural ly with the 
aging of the eye in which the clear gel that fills the space between the lens 
and the back of the eye separates away from the back of the eye)  
• Intraocular inflammation (swelling and redness inside the eye)  
• Foreign body sensation in eye  
• Eye irritation (redness)  
 Other Risks  
You should be aware that there might be additional risks that are currently 
unknown and unforeseeable. Your condition may not improve, or may worsen 
while participating in the study.  You may still require the current standard of 
care treatment  Avastin

LENS PATHOLOGY  
See AREDS [ADDRESS_669355] Photographs Below 
Nuclear Landmarks  - In the normal or nonsclerotic lens, the “nucleus” consists  
of a central dark interval (sulcus), adjacent bean- shaped brighter areas (lentils - 1 
anterior and 1 posterior to the sulcus), and brighter curved bands (lamellae or nuclear surface bands).  Although nuclear sclerosis Standard 1 shows signs of moderate opalescence, many of these features are visible.  
Grading Rules  - For grading the severity of nuclear sclerosis, two factors are 
considered: 1) the optical density (sometimes described as “opalescence”) of the nuclear landmarks, especially the sulcu s, and 2) the definitions of these structures 
(contrast between light and dark bands).  Optical density is given greater weight.  In the early stages of nuclear sclerosis, increased optical density is noticeable only in the normally dark bands, particular the sulcus, but in advanced stages the density of all bands becomes greater.  With increasing nuclear sclerosis, the definition of nuclear landmarks decreases, and finally disappears.  For grading status the primary 
consideration is the degree of reflectance (sometimes termed “opalescence”) of the 
sulcus, with secondary consideration given to the definition of the nuclear features, 
i.e. contrast of the dark and bright bands. 
Slit Lamp Settings  - Grading of nuclear opalescence is done with the illuminating 
beam of the slit lamp angled at 45 ° to the viewing axis, the slitbeam width set at  
0.[ADDRESS_669356] between the two standards; e.g., halfway between [ADDRESS_669357] and a completely opacified lens, e.g., 3.8 or 3.3.

VITREOUS PATHOLOGY  
Vitreous pathology will include an examination of the anterior vitreous that can be visualized with the slit lamp technique.  Special notation should be made for hemorrhage, cells, or flare.  Each condition is to be noted and graded according to the following scale:  
 
               None (Normal)  ...     0             Mild ....................  +1       Moderate……........ +2

ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE [ADDRESS_669358] OPHTHALMOSCOPY  
Ophthalmoscopy is an examination of the back part of the eyeball (fundus), which 
includes the retina , optic disc, choroid , and blood vessels. 
Indirect ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy are performed afte r eye 
drops are placed to dilate the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]. Direct ophthalmoscopy can be performed with or without dilation of the pupil. 
The examiner performs this examination by [CONTACT_516442]. The examiner 
wears an indirect ophthalmoscope on the head. While holding the eye open each quadrant of the eye will be examined and noted for any pathology utilizing a hand-held lens (preferably 20D). If any pathology is found or suspected in the periphery of the retina a scleral depressed examination will also be performed .

 8.  B- SCAN ULTRASOUND FOR PVD  
The following b- scan instructions are simply additional guidance. The formal b- scan 
protocol for site use throughout this study will be provided directly from Duke 
Reading Center.  Posterior vitreous detachment is a common condition associated with aging.  It occurs when the posterior hyaloid detaches or separates from the retina as the vitreous liquefies.  B-scan is a useful tool for detecting the presence of a PVD in both opaque and clear ocular 
media.  A summary of this protocol can be found in Exhibit A (page 10).    
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 63 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Instrumentation  
The Ellex Innovative Imaging v3 B-scan instrument or similar kinetic B -scan is to be used 
for B-scan examinations  on study subjects.  The Ellex machine provides a 10 MHz 
transducer and allows the storage of both static images (echograms) and video footage 
(movies) in 10 second increments.  The suggested steps  to be followed in the use of the v3 
machine are listed in Exhibit B  (page 13). 
 B-scan Basic s  
The B-scan probe contains a transducer surrounded by [CONTACT_516444].  The transducer oscillates 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_516393], producing a focused sound beam.  The sound beam moves to and from a marker located on the probe housing.  Once emitted into the eye, the sound beam is 
reflected from any acoustic interfaces in its path (e.g., vitreous pathology and the retina) 
and corresponding echoes are displayed on the display screen of the instrument. The acoustic section obtained is very thin, much like the slice of the knife.  Therefore, for a 
thorough examination of the posterior segment, the sound beam must be moved throughout the vitreous cavity. 
     
Proper interpretation of a B-scan echogram requires knowing where the probe is positioned and where the probe marker is directed.  The B -scan echogram is demarcated on the left by 
[CONTACT_516445].  The right side of 
the echogram corresponds to the portion of the eye located opposite the center of the probe 
face.  The upper aspect of the echogram represents the region of eye where the probe 
marker is directed.  The lower aspect of the echogram corresponds to the region of the eye located opposite the probe marker (Fig 1 ).   
 Subject Confidentiality and Naming Convention Per established HIPAA guidelines, the identity of study subjects must be masked.  Therefore, no identifiable subject data should be visible on any study materials. 
 
A naming convention is used to identify the site, subject, and visit on each A- or B -scan 
image.  The four components of the convention, separated by [CONTACT_465260] ( _), include the site number, subject number, subject initials, and visit label.  These identifiers are recorded as follows: three- digit site number_, three- digit subject number_, three letter 
subject initials_, and a one-digit visit number (e.g., 001_001_ABC_1).  B- scan images 
must also be labeled according to the area of eye examined (see “Labeling B -scan 
Images”).

 *B-scan examination will be performed per the schedule described above.  Should the subject have an unscheduled visit with a B-scan examination, that visit # is 99.    NOTE:  Whenever the investigator  determines (by [CONTACT_208600] B -scan) that a subject 
has a total PVD, then B-scan examinations will not be performed on the subject at subsequent visits to the site.    B-scan Screening Examination of the Posterior Segment 
Before starting the examination, ensure that patient identifiers have been  placed on the 
instrument screen (see “Subject Confidentiality and Naming Convention”).  The gain is set 
at maximum and the screen brightness is adjusted appropriately for the detection of low reflective echoes within the vitreous cavity.  An ophthalmic coupling gel is applied to the 
probe.  A preservative free gel (e.g., Gen Teal Gel)  is recommended to minimize irritation 
to the eye.    The patient is positioned comfortably, preferably in a reclined position, with the eye to be 
examined situated close to the screen display to facilitate hand -eye coordination.  Local 
anesthetic drops are instilled and the room lighting is dimmed.  The subject i s asked to 
fixate away from the probe, toward the portion of eye being examined.  The examination is conducted with the probe placed  directly on the conjunctiva.  Placement of the probe on the 
conjunctiva promotes sound beam penetration and helps determine which area of the eye is being examined.    The posterior segment of the eye is examined systematically using basic screening techniques (i.e., specific transverse and longitudinal scans).  The findings of each patient examination are documented with certain  echograms and movies. 
 Longitudinal Scans  
In a longitudinal probe position, the sound beam produces a radial section.  The beam sweeps perpendicular to the limbus and parallel to a single meridian of the opposite fundus (i.e., one clock hour).  For the screening examination, longitudinal scans are performed along the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:[ADDRESS_669360] the ciliary body (Fig 2).  Peripheral aspects of a meridian ar e best displayed with the probe resting near the fornix. 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE [ADDRESS_669361] the center of the cornea and the meridian being 
examined.  As the probe is slowly shifted from limbus to fornix, it is simultaneously rocked slightly fro m side to side to help ensure lesion detection.  Longitudinal scans are performed 
as follows: 
• 12:00 meridian; probe is placed at 6:00 
• Nasal meridian; probe is placed at 9:00 OD or 3:00 OS 
• 6:00 meridian; probe is placed at 12:00 
• Temporal meridian; probe is placed at 3:00 OD or 9:[ADDRESS_669362] of the PVD, typi[INVESTIGATOR_516394] (Fig 3).  However, in a highly elevated and/or folded PVD, the  
 Weiss ring will usually be situated more anteriorly (and not necessarily overlying the optic disc).  Therefore, detection of the Weiss ring may be more challenging in this form of total 
PVD. 
 
A partial PVD is attached to the retina in one or more areas and may still be attached to the 
macula and optic disc.  Insertion of the PVD into the vitreous base is sometimes demonstrated.  When limited in extent, a partial PVD typi[INVESTIGATOR_516395] a smooth, shallow membranous acoustic interface that exhibits little or no mobility.  A Weiss ring 
usually cannot be identified in a partial PVD.  No PVD is detected when the posterior hyaloid is completely attached to both t he retina 
and the optic disc.  Assessment of Mo bility 
An important aspect of diagnosing an extensive PVD with B- scan is the evaluation of 
mobility.  An extensive or total PVD typi[INVESTIGATOR_516396].  The mobility of membranous acoustic interfaces is captured in a movie.  To evaluate mo bility, the area of interest is displayed, the probe is held stationary, and the 
patient is asked to move their eye back and forth two or three times.  Sufficient gel is applied to the probe face and a scan is performed with the patient fixating away fr om the 
probe, toward the area being examined.  IMPORTANT : The area of interest should 
remain on the screen throughout the procedure.  This is accomplished by [CONTACT_516446].   
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 66 
PROTOCOL DME -202B For longitudinal scans (e.g., LM and  RM), the patient is asked to move their eye in a radial 
manner, toward (but not into) the probe face.  During this procedure, the optic nerve void is 
displayed before, during, and following the eye movement.  Maintaining display of the optic nerve void provides for the assessment of lesion mobility in relation to the optic disc (and the macula for the LM and RM views).    Documentation of Findings The presence or absence of a PVD should be clearly documented in both movies and echograms.  The purpose of documentation is to record all pertinent findings of the B- scan 
examination.  When any membranous acoustic interfaces are detected, the appearance, location (including any insertions into the fundus), presence of a Weiss ring , and mobility 
should be well demonstrated.  Movies and echograms are initially stored on the internal 
hard drive of the instrument (see Exhibit B).   To make a movie for the purpose of demonstrating mobility, the first step is to localize the area of interest.  Once the pathology is clearly displayed, the probe is held steady, the patient is asked to maintain their fixation, and the image is frozen.  The probe is then restarted and the patient is asked to move their eye back and forth two or three times (t o fill 
the 10 second time-frame).  By [CONTACT_516447], lesion mobility can be captured adequately in the [ADDRESS_669363] (see  
Exhibit C).  The final step is to upload the images on the flash drive to a website for grading by [CONTACT_516448] (see Uploading B- scan Images to Secure 
Website).  
 Baseline Visit  
Vitreous status and mobility is captured in the movies. The required images are:

PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX D: INVESTIGATORS OBLIGATIONS  
 
The Investigator is obligated to:  1. Obtain and submit to the Sponsor a copy of his/her Institutional (Ethical) Review Board’s (IRB) approval of the protocol prior to initiating the study.  
 2. Obtain signed informed consent from each subject or his/her legal guardian, prior to acceptance of the subject into the study, and provide a copy of the signed informed consent to the Sponsor. 
 3.  In the event of a serious, severe or unexpected incident or adverse experience, whether related to the use of the investigational drug or device or not, or the death of a subject, the investigator is responsible for notifying the Sponsor immediately (see Appendix E, Procedures for Handling and Reporting Adverse Reactions).   
 4. Read, and agree to adhere to the study protocol prior to the initiation of the study.  Deviations from the study protocol are not to be implemented without the prior written approval of the Sponsor, unless protection of the safety and welfare of the study subjects requires prompt action.  During the study, if the investigator feels that in his/her clinical judgment, it is necessary to promptly terminate one or more subjects from the study, or to promptly implement reasonable alternatives to, or 
deviations from the protocol in consideration of the safety of study subjects, the Sponsor is to be notified of these terminations, and deviations, and reasons for such changes are to be documented in th e study records.  The investigator is to also notify 
any Institutional Review Board to which he/she is responsible of any such changes. 
 5. Accurately record, at the clinical site, all required data on each subject’s Case Report Form.  The original Case Report Form will be forwarded to the Sponsor in a manner mutually agreed upon by [CONTACT_5226].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_516398]’s possession.

PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX E:  WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF 
HELSINKI  
 
Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 I. BASIC PRINCIPLES  
 1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal ex perimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. 
 2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted for consideration, comment and guidance to a specially appointed 
committee independent of the investigator and the sponsor, provided that this independent committee is in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is performed. 
 3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by [CONTACT_516453] a clinically competent medical person.  The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a 
medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his or her consent. 
 4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject. 
 5. Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by [CONTACT_516454].  Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.  
 6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be respected.  Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject 
and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject’s physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
 7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable.  Physicians should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits. 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE [ADDRESS_669369]’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. 
 10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the  subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or 
may consent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship. 
 11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal 
guardian in accordance with national legislation.  Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation.  
  Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give consent, the minor’s consent must 
be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor’s legal guardian. 
 12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration are complied with.  
 II. MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE (CLINICAL RESEARCH)  
 1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgment it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering.  
 2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed 
against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
 3. In any medical study, every patient - including those of a control group, if any - 
should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methods.  This does not exclude the use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE [ADDRESS_669370] never interfere wi th the 
physician -patient relationship. 
 
5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee (I, 2). 
 6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research is justified by [CONTACT_516455].  
 III. NON-THERAPEUTIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN 
SUBJECTS (NON- CLINICAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH)  
 1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of 
that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out. 
 2. The subjects should be volunteers - either healthy persons or subjects for whom the 
experimental design is not related to the patient’s illness.  
 3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual. 
 4. In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well -being of the subject.  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 77 
PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX F :  STUDY MONITORING  
 
1. Member(s) of the Sponsor’s clinical research team or designee will meet with the investigator prior to the initiation of the study, in order to assess the adequacy of the investigator’s patient population, facilities, and equipment, and to familiarize the investigator with the protocol. 
 2. A member of the Sponsor’s clinical research team or designee will meet with the investigator after several of the subjects have initiated the study, in order to ensure 
that the subjects are being properly selected, that adequate supplies for the study have been provided and that the assignment of medication is properly recorded.  In addition, the monitor will verify that the investigator follows the approved pr otocol 
and all approved amendments, if any, by [CONTACT_516456]’s regulatory documents, source documents, informed consent forms, and case report forms of study subjects. 
 3. A member of the Sponsor’s clinical research team or designee will meet with the 
investigator when all subjects have completed the Final Visit of the study, in order to collect the Case Report Forms, unused drugs, and unused supplies and materials. 
 4. Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, to ensure the proper progression and documentation of the study. 
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 78 
PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX G:  PROTOCOL CHANGES AND PROCEDURES  
If the investigator desires to modify the procedure and/or design of the study, he or she  
must contact [CONTACT_516457], where applicable, local 
Institutional Review Board, regarding the proposed changes. Any changes to the Study Protocol will only be made in the form of protocol amendments, signed by [CONTACT_516458](s), and approved by [CONTACT_4707], prior to their implementation.  
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 79 
PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX H:  INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION OF SOURCE 
DOCUMENTS AND CASE REPORT FORMS  
 
1. Complete source documents will be supplied to the study sites. The source 
documents should be filled out using a black ink ball-point pen.   
 2. At each subject visit, the appropriate source document must be completed.  The data will be entered into the CRF.  Be sure to provide all information requested 
including subject identification number and initials, name [CONTACT_4236], date(s), 
etc.  All applicable questions should be answered and all data requested should be supplied.  Those areas, which require a response but are not filled in correctly are considered incomplete or erroneous entries, and will have to be corrected.  Supplying all the necessary data the first time saves office time for the investigator during subsequent audits and monitoring visits. 
 
3. If the investigator needs to correct an erroneous entry on the source documents, the only acceptable procedure  is to draw a single horizontal line  through the incorrect 
entry, enter the correct data next to it, then initial and date the new entry, explain if 
necessary, without obscuring the original entry.  Even if the correction is made on 
the same date as at the top of the form, the date must still be supplied next to the correction, since there is no other way of identifying when the correction was made.  Correction fluid (“Whiteout”), eraser, or any other correction methods that would obscure the original entry are NOT allowed. 
 4. All medications used should be recorded on the Concomitant Medication form, with the appropriate start and stop date as applicable.  
5. All Adverse Events should be recorded on the Adverse Event form with appropriate event name, start and stop dates, relation to study drug, intensity, and outcome. 
 6. The completed source documents are to be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].

Phase 2

 1. INTRODUCTION 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. The purp ose of this protocol is to ensure that this study is to be 
conducted according to ICH GCP guidelines (CRF 21 Part 312), applicable government regulations and Institutional 
research policies and procedures. 
 
2. BACKGROUND  2.1 Background Prevalence of Research Topic Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a critical public heal th problem and requires more efficacious behavioral and 
pharmacologic treatments.  Existing behavioral and pharmaco logic treatments have major limitations. Currently approved 
medications have only modest efficacy and are therefore underutilized. They have only small to moderate effect sizes and are limited by [CONTACT_101583], while behavioral treatments ha ve limited access and adherence.  Neither behavioral nor 
pharmacologic treatments by [CONTACT_101584]/optimal outcomes. While pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_101518], they may lose effectiveness after discontinuation of treatment, whereas 
neurocognitive training interventions such as AABM have been  shown to have more lasting effects. New treatments are 
needed – in particular, treatments that could lead toward co mbinations of behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy. 
 The project will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101519] a potential 
treatment in heavy-drinking individuals. The purpose of the tria l is to assess and establish the feasibility of conducting 
controlled trials of AABM in human laboratory alcohol drinkin g studies.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_101520].  Importantly, early clinical studies by [CONTACT_101585] (AABM) 
training may reduce relapse to alcohol use in pati ents with AUD who have already stopped drinking.  
One potential AUD treatment modality is to reduce automatic alcohol approach tendencies th rough alcohol approach bias 
modification (AABM) training. AABM has effects on reducing alcohol use and relapse to AUD. However, few treatment 
trials have been conducted with AABM and little is known ab out its efficacy in reducing drinking in human laboratory 
alcohol consumption, especia lly in non-treatment-seeking, heavy-drinking individuals. 
 2.2 Prior Experience  
2.2.1 Clinical Experience 
 Behavioral and neural correlates of implicit alcohol-approach behavior Patients with substance use disorders exhibit an automati c tendency to approach rather than to avoid drug cues
1,2,3-6. The 
associative process central to alcohol-approach behavior can be measured with a relatively new joystick task called the 
Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) developed by [CONTACT_101586]. (2007)6. Differences in pulling an image toward one vs. 
pushing it away in relation to the content (e.g., alcoho l pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]) are interpreted as automatic action tendencies7. 
Responses to appetitive cues ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_101521]8. The alcohol AAT taps implicit automatic approach 
tendencies9-11.  To assess implicit responding or unconscious bias12, participants are asked to respond to an irrelevant 
feature of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] – its format (left- or right-tilt) rath er than to the alcohol or non-alcohol content of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] 
(explicit responding). The first study of alcohol approa ch-bias using the AAT was conducted by [CONTACT_101587]., (2009)12. In 
this study, heavy drinking students exhibited an alco hol approach-bias toward alcohol but not to generally 
positive/negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (e.g., people and animal images)12.   
 Modification of implicit alcohol-approach tend ency: Alcohol Approach Bias Modification 
Implicit alcohol approach-bias is related to changes in the motivational system in alcohol dependence and in heavy drinkers. Implicit alcohol-approach bias represents a target for clinical intervention. Wiers et. al., (2010)
13 adapted the 
implicit alcohol AAT to be used as an intervention by [CONTACT_101588][INVESTIGATOR_101522], 
which were to be pulled or pushed. To train participants to avoid alcohol, 90% of the alcohol pi[INVESTIGATOR_101523]-format and 90% of the soft-drink pi[INVESTIGATOR_101524]-format. Wiers et. al., (2010)13 demonstrated that 
this alteration in task resulted in reductions in alcohol approach-bias (measured with the or iginal implicit alcohol AAT), 
and in reduced drinking behavior in “hazar dous drinkers” (not AUD) compared to  those who were trained to approach-
alcohol. This was the first study to show that retraining au tomatic approach processes could help to regain control over 
addictive impulses. A training version of the implicit alcohol AAT, named Alcohol Approach Bias Modification (AABM), has 
been studied in a handful of RCTs targeting alcohol dependent patients in in-patient treatment settings. 
[ADDRESS_112394] randomized controlled trial of AABM for alcohol was completed by [CONTACT_101589]. al.(2011)
14. An inpatient cohort of 
214 AUD patients (not active heavy drinkers ) were assigned to one of two experimental conditions; an explicit and implicit 
condition in which they were trained to make avoidance moveme nts (pushing joystick) or to one of two control conditions 
in which they received sham or no training.  Results showed successful alcohol approach-bias modification14. 
Furthermore, clinical outcomes were obtained from 87% of the patients one year later. Patients in the experimental 
condition showed better treatment outcomes; only 46% of the experimental group relapsed (resumed drinking >2 days) 
vs 59% of the control group14. Eberl et al,15 extended the AABM work to determin e the optimal amount of training 
needed to maximize the change in alcohol approach bi as. Based on these responses, the recommended number of 
training sessions is 6, 9, or 12, dependent on resources15.  We will provide 6 sessions over 2 weeks. 
 The Role of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_101525] ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]’ is widespread in clinical and translational research
16.  UCSF biostatistician  Kraemer17, asserts that 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_101526], rather than attempt to estab lish the sample size for a future larger 
study.  “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_101527]-testing  studies,” because they can 
“check on the availability of … subjects using the recruitmen t methods proposed, “test the fe asibility of the treatment and 
measurement protocols, train researchers, and to set up data… capabilities”.  The present prop osal is designed to do so. 
 
3. RATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE  
3.1 Problem Statement We will combine AABM with a human laboratory methodolog y of assessing alcohol consumption – the Yale Alcohol 
Drinking paradigm (ADP) –  to assess the feasibility of thes e combined methods for use in future studies to test AABM 
efficacy in alcohol use reduction and abstinence initiation in ac tively drinking individuals with AUD --  not only for relapse 
prevention in already abstinent individuals (as previous tria ls have done) -- and not just to rely on self-reports of 
drinking/relapse behavior, but to obtain  actual measures of alcohol use. 
 
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact We will conduct the first pi[INVESTIGATOR_101528]-treatment-
seeking, heavy-drinking individuals and the first trial of AABM e ffects on the Yale Alcohol Drinking Paradigm - a method of 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101529]. Participants 
will be 12 non-treatment-seeking heavy-drinking male volunt eers. After baseline assessment, participants will undergo 
Human Lab session 1, in which we will administer the Alco hol Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) (not AABM training) to 
measure baseline (pre-treatment) alcohol approach bias tend ency, and then conduct the ADP to measure baseline alcohol 
consumption. After Human Lab/ADP Session 1,  participants get 2 weeks of a total of 6 sessions of training; they will have 
been randomly assigned to undergo AABM or  a sham training condition. Outcomes will be various measures of feasibility, 
including recruitment, retention, safety, and adverse effect s and assessment of measuremen t burden, and the tolerability 
of ADP and AABM interventions  
3.[ADDRESS_112395] ive treatments for alcoholism, the ri sk-benefit ratio appears favorable. 
 Participants may benefit somewhat from th e extra physical examination, laboratory tests, and attention. In the informed 
consent form, participants are instructed:  “Taking part in this  study may not make your health better. If you are in this 
study, you may benefit from the physical examinations, blood tests, and review of your symptoms. Others may benefit from 
the overall conclusions drawn from  the results of this study.” 
 AUD is major public health problem that contributes prominen tly to the global burden of disease [58].  While there are 
several approved medications for the treatment of AUD, the available pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_101530], adverse effects, and limited adoption into practice. Currently available FDA-approved  pharmacological agents have 
major limitations and there is a critical need to identify novel medication strategi es for AUD treatment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_101531], medications are grea tly underutilized and only a small minority of adults in the 
[ADDRESS_112396] inking. There is a great need for the development of new 
methods to treat alcohol use disorder. This laboratory paradi gm will also provide information regarding the mechanism of 
action of this novel method and thus significantly contribute to the literature .  
 
3.3.2 Potential Risks and Procedures to Minimize Risks  The major potential risks in this study are related to administra tion of alcohol, blood drawing during the physical exam and 
the alcohol drinking period, and risks to privacy.  
 Alcohol 
A number of medical conditions could potentially be worsened by [CONTACT_30286] (e.g., liver disease, cardiac abnormality, pancreatitis, diabetes, neurological problems, diab etes, and gastrointestinal disorders). During screening, the 
study physician will conduct a medical history and physical exam  and review laboratory findings.  As a result, participants 
with medical problems that are judged by [CONTACT_101590]/PI ([CONTACT_101633]) will be excluded from the study. 
 Alcohol may also cause nausea in high dose s; however, nausea is not expected at the dose being used in this sample of 
heavy drinkers. Participants will not be dr inking to levels more than they typi[INVESTIGATOR_101532], 
and, with the exception of the priming dose, they determine the amount of alcohol consumed.  
Another area of potential risk to participants under the influence of alcohol involves their safety during the experimental 
procedures. Although impairment of gross motor coordination in  heavy drinkers is rare at the alcohol dose used in this 
study, all participants will be under the supervision of the experimenters to prevent possible accidents such as falls. 
Participants will not leave the laboratory during the self-administration procedure,   
Alcohol is a reinforcing agent, which may cause changes in be havior including repetitive or excessive alcohol consumption. 
Because of this, the administration of alcohol to alcoholics in treatment could potentially impede the progress of their 
recovery. In addition, the administration of alcohol to sober alcoholics living in the community presents a possible risk of 
relapse. As a result, we will be recruiting non-abstinent no n-treatment-seeking alcoholics in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_101533]'s recent update of its [ADDRESS_112397] that their drinking 
exceeds standards for avoiding hazardous drinking, providing a br ief one-session motivational intervention for their drinking, 
and by [CONTACT_101591]. In our previous and ongoing work, several participants 
quit drinking and many others reduced their drinking in the three months following this intervention. 
 
***Protection against risks of alcohol challenges*** 
The alcohol challenges will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Batki and rese arch staff, using methodology adopted from the Yale group, 
and trained by [CONTACT_101592], [CONTACT_101634]-Sarin.   We provide a number of safeguards to reduce the risk of physic al injury by [CONTACT_101593]. We al so exclude participants for 
whom physical or psychological problems contraindicate alcohol consumption. By [CONTACT_101594]-treatment-seeking 
participants who are currently drinking heavily on a regular basis,  we are not exposing participants to alcohol consumption 
levels that differ from their normal drinking context. Although  this has not happened in the Yale group’s experience, should 
a participant insist on leaving the research setting prematurely, we will provide transportation back to their residence. This contingency will be explicitly addressed in the consent form.   
[ADDRESS_112398].  
***Protection against the risk of heavier alcohol use, suicidalit y, or other medical or psychiatric problems that may arise 
over the course of the study*** 
To protect against this risk, we will do the following: -We will closely monitor alcohol use at each visit. -Participants will be withdrawn from the study if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101534], there is: sustained clinically signifi cant 
increase in alcohol use between ADP sessions 1 and 2, suicidal ideation consisting of suicidal intent or plan, unacceptable 
adverse events judged by [CONTACT_5989] (the PI, [CONTACT_101633]) to be related to study interven tions, or any other clinically 
significant medical, psychiatric, or subs tance use related poor outcome that makes continued study participation unsafe. 
 Blood and Urine Collections 
Screening blood and urine collections are performed primarily as safeguards to participants and should add no risks other 
than those normally associated with these procedures. Partic ipants will have approximately 8 mL or 2 tsp of blood drawn 
at the intake appointment to determine liver and kidney function ing, and during the self-administration portions of the study 
we will draw approximately 3 mL or ½ tsp of blood at each of the 2 visits. Therefore, the total amount of blood drawn 
during the study (17 ml or 3.5 tsp) poses minimal risk in he althy participants. We will advise participants against donating 
blood for six weeks following study participation.  Blood Drawing (Venipuncture) Risks  
Participation in the study requires participants to have th eir blood drawn 3 different times over the course of study 
(screening and human laboratory ADP sessions 1 and 2).  Havin g blood drawn may cause pain (common), fainting/passing 
out (not very often), a bruise where the needle goes in (not very often), and infection at the same place (rare).  
 
***Protection against blood drawing (venipuncture) risks*** 
To protect against this risk, we will do the following: 
1) Professionally trained phlebotomists at the CTSI C linical laboratory will pe rform all phlebotomies.  
 Risk of Privacy/Confidentiality 
Participation in the study presents a risk to the participant of  loss of privacy and confidentiality regarding research materia l, 
particularly with respect to potentially em barrassing or harmful personal health  information, particularly related to 
mental health and alcohol and substance use. This includes detailed and sensitive information regarding alcohol and drug 
use, and psychiatric symptoms.  For example, urine drug te sting will be conducted.  Potential release of information 
regarding drug use, in particular, could have serious im plications if made known, for example legal ramifications, 
jeopardizing insurability or employability.    In order to ensure the safety of the participant and others , information may be shared between research staff and the 
clinical team only under the following circ umstances: 1) If in the judgment of the study physician, the participant has a 
psychiatric or medical condition that requir es urgent attention to protect the safety of the participant or others; and 2) If a  
participant has missed several study appointments, and research  staff needs to verify the participant's whereabouts and/or 
verify the participant's safety.  These above circumstances will be clearly outlined  in the informed consent form, and be 
discussed and clarified with prospective participants at the start of the study.  
***Protection against risks to privacy/confidentiality***  
To protect against this risk, we will do the following: 
 In the informed consent form, participants are instructed: “P articipation in research may involve a loss of privacy, but 
information about you will be handled as con fidentially as possible.  If you do not already have a medical record at the VA 
Medical Center, San Francisco, one will be created because of your participation in this study.” 
 HIPAA regulations will be followed throughout this study. Several methods will be used to decrease the risk of loss  of 
confidentiality to participants.   
o First, all study forms will be labeled wi th a unique, identifying code number, and maintained in a locked cabinet. Those 
[ADDRESS_112399] of the questionnaire data  will be collected using an online survey instrument called Qualtrics: 
All collected research data will be refere nced by [CONTACT_101595], stored in an electronic database 
(SQL server) on a password-protected secure VA server behind a secure VA firewall at SFVAMC available to study staff only. After receiving CHR and R&D approval, we will be collecting most  of our questionnaire measures in digital format, so that 
this questionnaire data can be collected using an online surv ey instrument called Qualtrics, which meets strict IRB and 
HIPAA data security requirements. Data will be entered into SQ L Server tables using MS Access as a front-end or batch load 
from an external file.  At a point of entry, form values are subjected to consistency edit checks (e.g. range and type verification, missing data). Scoring algorithms are applied wher e appropriate. Once data is entered into the database, edit 
checks are run for accuracy.  
Unknown Risks 
Participants may experience side effects that are not known yet.  
 
***Protection against unknown risks*** 
To protect against this risk, we will do the following: 
-During the informed consent process, participants will be notified about the possibility of unknown risks associated with 
taking lacosamide or their combination with alcohol.  
-During the informed consent process, the possibility of unknown  risks are explained and that researchers will let participants 
know if new information about risks and side effects becomes available over the course of the study.  
-Adverse effects will be carefully moni tored during each ADP lab session. 
 
4. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
4.[ADDRESS_112400] the key questions the study is expected to answer. Be detailed, 
clear and as specific as possible. 
 
4.2 Primary Objective 
As this is a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the Primary Aims are process- rather than outcome -oriented:   
 
1. To establish the feasibility and safety of giving alcoho l to human participants in a laboratory alcohol self-
administration procedure;  
 
2. To establish the feasibility and safety of administering AABM training sessions; and   
2. To allow our research team to  gain experience with these procedures and fine-tune them.   
 
4.[ADDRESS_112401] trial of AABM effects on the Yale Alco hol Drinking Paradigm - a method of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101535]. Participants will be 12 non-
treatment-seeking heavy-drinking male volunteers. After baseline assessment, participants will undergo Human Lab 
session 1, in which we will administer the Alcohol Appr oach-Avoidance Task (AAT) (not AABM training) to measure 
baseline (pre-treatment) alcohol approach bias tendency , and then conduct the ADP to measure baseline alcohol 
consumption. After Human Lab/ADP Session 1,  participants get [ADDRESS_112402] on Week 2 (1st human lab session) and Week 5 
(2nd human lab session). After each human lab session, a stud y coordinator will conduct a phone visit which is estimated 
to take 10 minutes. In addition to the human lab sessions, participants will come to the Ft. Miley campus 3 times per 
week for 3 weeks to complete Alcohol Approach Bias Modificat ion (AABM) training sessions. These computerized training 
sessions last 20-[ADDRESS_112403] to spend about 32 hours over the course of 6 
weeks.  5.2 Outcome Variables

Withdrawal Assessment Scale (CIWA-AD) score > 8; 
8. Participants who report disliking beer will be ex cluded because beer will be provided during the 
alcohol self-administration periods. 
 
6. METHODS 
 
The study will consist of the following steps, replicating the Yale ADP methods:  
(1) Recruitment;  
(2) Pre-screening: Brief telephone or in-person to determine eligibility for full screening beginning with establishing non-
treatment seeking status;  (3) Full Screening/baseline visit: 1-3 in-perso n visits to obtain consent and to evalua te eligibility (e.g. to reject participa nts 
with medical conditions): participants who meet heavy drinking criteria , and by [CONTACT_101597]-
treatment seeking . If these criteria are met, physical examination and laboratory testing will be conducted. Eligible 
participants then proceed to the main part of the study, which includes participation in 2 human lab sessions and 6 AABM 
training sessions. (4) Human Lab ADP Sessions 1 and 2: There will be two se ssions, Human Lab/ADP Session 1 (Pre-training), and Human 
Lab/ADP Session 2 (post-training). Alcohol Drinking Paradigm (ADP): After the alcohol cue-induced craving, subjects will 
be given the opportunity to self-administer alcohol using the ADP.  ( Table 1 ) Subjects are first given a moderate Priming 
Drink of alcohol at 11 AM, designed to raise blood alcohol to ~0.03 mg%, and are instructed to drink it within 5 minutes. 
At 1 PM, and again at 2 PM, subjects undergo two 1-hour lo ng alcohol Self-Administration (SA) periods. For each SA 
period, a tray of 4 beer drinks (each co ntaining an amount of alcohol calculated  to increase blood alcohol concentration 
by 0.015 mg%) will be brought into the Lab room along with a "tab" sheet worth $12. Participants are told that these 4 
drinks will be available for the next 60 minutes, and they can choose to drink or keep the money; each drink will cost $3. 
The money will be given by [CONTACT_101598]. This monetary cost for each drink was determined to 
reliably reflect the trade-off between desire to drink and cost20,21. The main measure is the number of drinks 
consumed over the course of two 1-hour-long SA periods.  [CONTACT_30327]-Sarin at Yale University helped to develop 
the ADP, and it has been adopted by [CONTACT_101599]22-33. 
(5) Phone Visits 1 and 2: After each Human Lab ADP session, a study coordinator will call the participant to check in by 
[CONTACT_648].  
(6) Alcohol Approach Bias Modification (AABM) training: Immediately following completion  of Human lab Session 1, 
patients will be randomly assigned to re ceive 6 sessions of AABM training over 2 weeks beginning 2-7 days after Human 
Lab/ADP Session 1. We will use a training version of the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task: patients are asked to respond 
to the format of presented pi[INVESTIGATOR_49958] a joystick (push righ t-tilted pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], pull left-tilted  pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]), irrespective of t he 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]’ content. Pushing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101536]; pulling a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101537] (zoom effect). 
There are 2 categories of pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]; [ADDRESS_112406] is 
achieved by [CONTACT_101600][INVESTIGATOR_101538]-alcoholic drinks in pull format only. 200 trials are 
presented per session (~20 minutes) with  a short break halfway through.  
(7) Participants then undergo a Follow-up visit [ADDRESS_112407] ADP session, where adverse events and alcohol use 
will be assessed and a research clinician will provide a motivational  enhancement session to encourage these non-
treatment seeking participants to consider trea tment and provided with referral materials.

6.1 Treatment – Computerized Training  6.1.[ADDRESS_112408] alcohol. The proposed Alcohol AAT 
was developed based on the previous work of Wiers et. al., (2009) 
10,12 and Rink et al., (2007)50.  
 6.1.2 Dosage, Administration Schedule Patients are instructed to respond to the format of presented pi[INVESTIGATOR_49958] a joystick (push right-tilted pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], pull left-
tilted pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]), irrespective of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]’ content. Push ing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_101536], while pulling a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101539] (zoom effect). There are 2 categories of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]; 20 different alcoholic and 20 different non-alcoholic 
beverages (soft drinks). Patients are instructed to either push  or pull for left-tilted images and to perform the alternative 
response for right-tilted images. All images are presented in both formats. The difference in  reaction times (RT) between 
push and pull is the approach bias. The task starts with 10 pr actice trials showing neutral objects (containers), followed by 
[ADDRESS_112409] trials.  A standardized d-score is calculated which represents  differences in reaction time for pushing vs. pulling75. 
Negative values indicate less alcohol-approach bias75.  
 
6.1.3 Method of Assignment/Randomization 
All participants will receive the active AABM training intervention.  6.1.4 Blinding and Procedures for Unblinding Not applicable  
6.1.5 Packaging/Labelling 
Not applicable  6.1.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Participants will be informed that they cannot use psyc hoactive drugs including antipsychotics, anxiolytics and 
antidepressants during the 30 days prior to entry, as well as anticonvulsants, beta blockers, central nervous system 
stimulants or depressants, or other drugs that cause exce ssive sedation in the judgment of the study physician/PI. 
Additionally, if participants engage in treatment for alcohol use disorder while enrolled in the study, then they will be withdrawn as they are no longer considered eligible.  6.1.[ADDRESS_112410] of study measures below, Sec. 6.3.5

6.2.1 Efficacy This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], not an efficacy study. The primary outcome variables are measures of feasibility: 
1. Time needed to recruit, screen, and run the study procedures for 12 participants. 
2. Retention rates at the various in the study process (screening, Human Lab ADP session 1 + 2, AABM/sham 
training sessions 1-6, and follow-up). 
 
6.2.2 Safety  
Please see the study procedures, below, Sec. 6.3.5, and steps to minimize risks, above, in Sec.3.3.5. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Definition and Reporting  Adverse Events During the study, site personnel will note any change in th e condition(s) and the occurrence and nature of any adverse 
events. Important clinical information that comes to light during study participation will be communicated by [CONTACT_101601].   The study physician (either the PI, [CONTACT_101633]) will revi ew each participant’s safety at each study visit. 
-Lab results will be reviewed on the sa me day that the results are received. 
-Adverse effects reported by [CONTACT_101602]. -Adverse effect assessment will be done  by [CONTACT_101603] a daily 
basis, immediately after these adverse effects are repo rted by [CONTACT_101604]. 
  As with our current, CHR-approved clinical trials, the study physician, if not immediately present at the time of adverse 
effect data collection, will be contact[CONTACT_101605], pager, or text message, so that 
adverse effects can be discussed with the study physician. Th e study physician, based on examination of the participant 
and/or review of the participant’s data, will make a clinical ju dgment at each visit regarding wh ether it is safe to proceed 
with study medications.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101540], DSMB and study sponsor his assessment of the potent ial relatedness of each AE to protocol 
procedure, studied disease state, study dr ug via the CRF. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event CRF, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_101541], severity, and causality. 
  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice , an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a 
clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event 
can therefore be any of the following: 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding), symp tom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whethe r or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
 Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a 
known condition). 
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical conditio n (e.g., headache) not present at baseline. 
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test  (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is associated with symptoms or 
leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug. If a 
participant’s dosage is reduced or trea tment is discontinued as a result of an AE, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101542]. 
  Events leading to the clinical outcome of death from progre ssive disease will not be recorded as adverse events unless 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101543].   Serious adverse event (SAE) collection begins after the part icipant has signed informed consent and has received study 
drug. If a participant experiences an SAE after signing inform ed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, the event will 
NOT be collected unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101544] y have been caused by a protocol procedure. 
  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101545] 24 hour s of the PI’s awareness of the event. Alerts issued via 
telephone will be immediately followed with offic ial notification on study-specific SAE forms.

 An SAE is any adverse event from this study th at results in one of the following outcomes: 
 death (excluding death due to progression of study disease, unless related to study drug); 
 initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
 a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying); 
 persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 considered significant by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_101546]. 
  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101547], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring after a participant ha s taken the last dose of study drug will be collected for [ADDRESS_112411] dose of study drug, regardless of the PI’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. Thereafter, SAEs will not be reported 
unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101548], or drug delivery system, or a protocol procedure. Any 
SAE occurring prior to enrollment that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101549] a protocol procedure will be reported to 
the study sponsor within 24 hours of the PI’s aw areness of the event and recorded on the CRF. 
  Study-specific clinical outcomes of death from progressive disease will be reported as SAEs only if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101550].   Immediate Reporting Requirements From 
 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_101551]: Certain events will be immediately reported to allow the Spon sor to take appropriate measur es to address potential new 
risks in a clinical trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101552]; under no circumstances will be reporting 
take place more than [ADDRESS_112412] of even ts that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101553] 24 hours after learning of the even t, regardless of relationship to study providers:

24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New significant information includes the following: 
 New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis; 
 Significant new diagnostic test results; 
 Change in causality based on new information; 
 Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery; 
 Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event.

 Follow-up of Participants after Adverse Events 
 PI [CONTACT_31051]-Up: 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_101557]-related adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, 
the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_978], new therapy is initia ted, the participant is lost to follow-up, or the participant 
withdraws consent.    Every effort will be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study procedures until a final outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) will be documented on the 
Adverse Event CRF and in the participant’s medical record to fa cilitate source data verification (SDV). If, after follow- up, 
return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be establishe d, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
CRF.   Data Review - For Phase II or III Sponsor Studies PIs will conduct continuous review of data regarding participan t safety at weekly study group meetings where the results 
of each participant’s treatment are discussed, as is currently done for the PI’s other UCSF CHR approved clinical trials. 
The discussion will include the number of participants, si gnificant toxicities as described in the protocol, doses 
adjustments, and observed responses.  6.3 Study Procedures

Bachelor of Arts or Science in a health-related field and/or have 2 years of research-related experience.  Training for the 
administration of informed consent teaches study staff ho w to move through the consent, assessing participant’s 
comprehension along the way. A staff member in training will (1) shadow a trained staff member conducting informed consent 2 times, then (2) practices info rmed consent with other lab members, an d finally (3) conducts informed consent 
with a participant while another trained lab member watches.  Once the staff member-in-training satisfactorily conducts 
informed consent under the supervision of another trained staff member, the staff-in-tra ining becomes authorized to 
conduct informed consent.  6.3.3 Screening After consent, participants will be sche duled for screening assessments. The screen ing phase is accomplished over a total 
of 1 to 3 visits. 
 
6.3.4 Enrollment Once a participant has completed all screening/baseline measur es and procedures and it has been determined that the 
participant is eligible and it is safe to partic ipate, then they will be enrolled in the study.

Assessments at Study Entry and During and After Human Lab Sessions 
 At Entry:  
These are adapted from previous/ current clinical st udies at the UCSF/SFVAMC Addiction Research Program.  
▪ Demographic data, will be assessed with data on age, race, socioeconomic status, mari tal status, educational and 
occupational levels, and significant medical history.   
►A number of safety evaluations are included: Medical hist ory and physical examination; Suicide Risk Assessment:   The 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [101]. It is a standa rd, thorough, frequently used method to screen for suicidal 
ideation, used by [CONTACT_101607];    Clinical Laboratory Tests for Health/Safety Monitoring: Blood samples will be  collected for chemistry, liver panel, renal 
panel and complete blood count (CBC); ur ine will be collected for urinalysis.  
▪ Structured Clinical Interview for DSM5, (SCID)  [96]: the SCID will be used to determine DSM-V diagnosis of current 
(current year) Alcohol Use Disorder, and the DSM-V current psychiatric diagnoses for anxiety, mood, psychotic, and non-alcohol substance use disorders in order to determine study eligibility.  ▪ Study Physician Review: All health measures, medical history/exams and labs will be reviewed by a study physician to ensure 
that the subject meets all the eligibility criteria and are ready for randomization ▪ Alcohol Approach Task (AAT): A way to measure pre-treatmen t alcohol approach bias tendency.  Salience Task: A survey 
that measures the salience of each stimulus image for participant.  At Entry and at various times throughout the study:   
▪ Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, DSM- IV Version (CIWA-AD): at entr y and before each Human Lab 
Session and at each Follow-up; ▪ Urine Drug Screen:  For opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], coca ine, amphetamines, cannabis, barbiturates:  at entry and before 
each Human Lab Session.  ▪ Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC); at entry and before each Human Lab Session; and duri ng each Human lab Session  
▪ Vital Signs : Temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure will be meas ured at study entry and multiple times during each 
Human Lab Session.  
▪ Concomitant Medications Review:   at entry and before each Human Lab session: thorough review of all concomitant 
medications (prescription or over-the-counter) in the pa st 30 days, as well as those started during the study. 
▪ Concomitant Treatment Log: At Entry and  A way to trac k any type of alcohol treatment at baseline/screening and 
throughout the study. ▪ Adverse Effects: Spontaneous: At Entry and at Human Lab Session 1 and 2; Phone visits 1 and 2; AABM Sessions 1-6; 1-
wk FU. This form is designed to collect information about adverse health events. We will ask about emergent AEs, follow-
up with AEs reported at previous study visits, and ask if there has been a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101558].  
▪ Timeline Followback (TLFB):   at study entry, then Human Lab Session [ADDRESS_112419] 30 days prior to consent and at the two Human Lab Sessions, and 
the 1-week follow-up. The TLFB will be used to determine whet her subjects meet minimum alcohol consumption criteria at 
entry. Other substance use will also be collected by [CONTACT_101608].  ▪ Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (version 11) (BIS-11)  [98]: This provides a trait measure of impulsiveness and will be used 
to characterize the study cohort at study entry.   At AABM Training Sessions: 
▪ Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT):  The AUDIT [97] is valid and reliabl e self-report measure of alcohol-
related problem severity.  ▪ Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS): At AABM sessions 1 and 6. A questionnaire that measures cognitive aspects 
of alcohol craving. 
15 
 ▪ Alcohol Purchase Task (APT): At AABM sessions 1 and 6. A questionnaire uses hypothetic al choices regarding alcohol 
purchases at varying prices to generate severa l indices of alcohol-related reinforcement.  
 
At Follow-up visit: 
▪ Motivational Enhancement Therapy: at the follow-up visit, research clinician will provide a motivational enhancement 
session to encourage the non-treatment seekin g participants to consider treatment.  
 Measures of Alcohol Effects:   
▪ Breath alcohol concentration (BrAlc) [99] 
at each visi t, and multiple times in ADP Sessions [ADDRESS_112420] recent alcohol use with the Intoximeters Alco-Sensor IV  instrument.  
▪ Blood Alcohol Levels : Human Lab Sessions 1 and 2 (Table 1) : Blood samples will be drawn to measure plasma levels of 
blood alcohol (BAC) during the priming dose and during the alcohol self-administration paradigm.   Blood samples will be stored at -4°C and will be analyzed at the San Francisco VA.   Time-line Follow-back (TLFB): To collect alcohol and drug use in the [ADDRESS_112421] 
90 days prior to consent and then throughout the 11 weeks of the study. Cigarette and substa nce use will also be collected 
by [CONTACT_75236]. 
▪ Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES) [81]: Human Lab Sessions 1 and 2 (Table 1).  This 14-item self-report rating scale 
measures alcohol stimulant/ sedative effects and is used regularly in the Yale ADP.   
▪ Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ):  At study entry; multiple times in Human La b Sessions 1 and 2 (Table 1); 1-wk FU; 1-
mo FU:  The AUQ is an 8-item questionnaire assessing desire, expectation of positive effect, and inability to avoid drinking 
if alcohol is available. The AUQ is a reliable and valid scale for the measur ement of self-reported alcohol urges. Its brevity 
and time frame for ratings (i.e. right now) makes it suitable for the ADP.  ▪ Yale Craving Scale (YCS): multiple times during ADP Sessions 1 and 2. A measure of craving for alcohol.  
▪ Ratings of Drinking Behavior During the Alcohol Self-Administra tion Period: multiple times in in Human Lab Sessions [ADDRESS_112422] sip and average time to consume each drink. ▪ Vital Signs: Human Lab Sessions 1 and 2 (Table 1).   These will include heart rate, blood pressure, and skin. The blood 
pressure cuff will be on subject's dominant arm while the probe of will be attached to the middle finger of the subject's non-dominant arm.   These data will be further used to examine the safety of using the study medications during alcohol self-administration.  
 
Neurocognitive Assessments: The battery was developed to assess performance in cogn itive domains commonly affected by [CONTACT_101609]-to-excellent no rms administered (~1.5 hours) at AABM sessions 1 and 9. Raw 
scores will be converted to z-scores. Do main-specific summary scores will be calculated by [CONTACT_85719] z-scores of the 
individual constituent measures. When feasible, alternat e forms will be used for repeated administrations. 
Domains and constituent measures: 
a) 
Risk Taking, Decision-making, and Motor/Choice Impulsivity:  Balloon Analogue Risk Task86; Iowa Gambling Task87; 
Stop-signal88, Delayed Discounting89;  
 Cognitive Training – Alcohol Approach Bias Modification (AABM) Training: 
Immediately following ADP Session 1, heavy drinking participan ts will begin to receive [ADDRESS_112423] over 3 weeks. We will use a training version of the Al cohol Approach-Avoidance Task: patients are asked to respond 
to the format of presented pi[INVESTIGATOR_49958] a joystick (push righ t-tilted pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], pull left-tilted pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]), irrespective of t he 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]’ content. Pushing pi[INVESTIGATOR_101536]; pulling a pi[INVESTIGATOR_101559] (zoom effect). There 
are 2 categories of pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]; 20 different alcoholic and 20 differe nt non-alcoholic beverages (soft drinks). Training effect is  
achieved by [CONTACT_101600][INVESTIGATOR_101538]-alcoholic drinks in pull format only. Two hundred 
training trials are presented per session (~20 minutes) with a short break halfway through.

7. TRIAL ADMINISTRATION 
 7.[ADDRESS_112426] (IRB) Review The Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) reviews and monitors research involving human participants at UCSF 
and affiliate institutions to ensure the ethical and equitable treatment of the research part icipants. Within the HRPP, the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews all research that involves human participants performed by [CONTACT_101611].  7.2 Unanticipated Problems [Explain how unanticipated problems that may occur during the study will be handled, communi cated to the IRB, sponsor, 
and FDA, if applicable.] 
 
7.3 Study Monitoring Study monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_4318].  7.4 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
Plan to monitor study progress and safety: The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMB)  
The DSMP for this project consists of: 
- a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) - a schedule of DSMB meetings to review study data and events 
[ADDRESS_112427] of study data and event items to be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318] 
- procedures for communicating DSMB findings to the CHR,  the study sponsor (Department of Defense) and other 
appropriate entities 
- a plan for conducting and reporting interim analysis 
- stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] - rules for withdrawing study participants from the study interventions  These elements of the DSMP are described below:  
The Data and Safety Mo nitoring Board (DSMB)  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is a group of  3 physicians who are not study investigators and who are 
experts in the area of clinical research and substance use diso rders.  The current composition of the PI’s DSMB is:  William 
Wolfe, M.D., a clinical investig ator and Medical Director, PTSD Clinic, SFVAMC ; Anne Richards, M.D. [medical Monitor], an 
experienced human clinical investigator, Assistant Professor of Psyc hiatry at University of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco and 
Steven Lieske, M.D., Ph.D., an experienced basic neuros cience investigator and attending psychiat rist, SFVAMC. 
 
The DSMB will meet biannually to review data reports prepared  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_101567], retention, outcomes, adverse events, and other issues related to patient safety.  The DSMB will 
make recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_101568].  The DSMB can 
consider patient safety or other circumstances as grounds for early termination.   Any member of the DSMB can ask for a 
meeting of the group if he/she feels that it is necessary, based upon the data. 
 During the course of the study, reports will be prepared an d distributed to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board on a 
biannual basis. In order for the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to discharge their duties for overseeing the study and 
the rights of the patients, they will receive analyses of  the primary outcome measures and the important secondary 
measures on a quarterly basis. The DSMB will receive reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) within [ADDRESS_112428] the following procedures to close-out the study: Submit a close-out report to the UCSF CHR Submit a notification to the Biosafety Committee to cl ose-out the Biological Use Authorization (BUA).  
Submit notification to the SF VA R& D Committee to close-out the project. 
Once all close-out reports have been processed, we will submit a notification to the study sponsor (UCSF RAP) with all 
other close-out reports.

4. How long will I be in the study?
In total, you will be asked to commit approximately 35 hours of your time over the course of 6 weeks.  
5. What will happen if I take part in this study?
All study procedures will take place at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. The study can be divided 
into 4 parts:
a. Screening: 1-3 visits over approximately 1 week.b. Main – ADP sessions: 2 all-day Alcohol Drinking Paradigm (ADP) sessions.
The 2 all-day ADP sessions will be at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. At each of these 2 all-
day study visits, you will participate in an alcohol drinking session under observed conditions. We 
refer to each of these all-day alcohol drinking sessions as the “Alcohol Drinking Paradigm (ADP)”.
c. Main – AABM sessions: 6 sessions over 2 weeks of Alcohol Approach Bias Modification (AABM) computer training. 
The AABM is a computerized training session during which you will interact with a computer by [CONTACT_101613] a joystick. During the task you will be asked to respond to the format of a presented pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], irrespective of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]’ content.

VA 10-1086Medical history and physical exam : 
The study doctor will take your medical history and review the medication you use. You will also have a 
brief physical examination. The history and physical exam are similar to those done for regular medical care. 
Vital signs : 
A study staff member will measure your blood pressure, heart rate, height and weight. Concomitant medication : 
A study doctor will review all the other medications you are currently taking to make sure it is safe for you 
to participate in the study.
Blood drawing (venipuncture) : 
You will be asked to give a blood sample for routine laboratory tests to check your health.  Approximately 
2 teaspoons of blood (8 ml) will be drawn by [CONTACT_4859] a needle into a vein in your arm for these tests. Blood will be taken for routine medical tests. 
Urine sample : 
You will be asked to give a urine sample to test for drug use, including recreational and illegal drugs and 
alcohol. 
Medical and psychiatric diagnoses : 
You will be evaluated for current and previous diagnoses.Substance use assessments: You will be asked to report your use of alcohol and other substances 
(cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, etc.) and possible alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
Questionnaires : You will be asked to complete questionnaires about your education, work, and other 
aspects of life. Some of the questionnaires ask that you answer detailed questions about your alcohol 
use, alcohol craving and family history of alcohol use. 
Cognitive testing : 
You will be asked to complete tests of your thinking ability that measure your thinking and decision-
making. Some of these tests are paper and pencil tests and some are completed on the computer. We will repeat these tests at the end of the study so that we can try to understand how alcohol and the AABM (computerized training) affects your use of alcohol, your craving for alcohol, and your thinking.  
5b. Procedures for the main phase – ADP Sessions:  
After the Screening tests have been reviewed by a study doctor, and if you continue to meet the eligibility 
requirements, you will begin the main part of the study.  
Overview : 
You will be asked to attend 2 all-day study visits at the San Francisco VA Medical Center for the main 
part of the study. At each of these 2 all-day study visits, you will participate in an alcohol drinking session under observed conditions. We refer to each of these all-day sessions as an Alcohol Drinking Paradigm (ADP).  
At each of these 2 ADP sessions, you will be offered alcoholic beverages and allowed to drink them 
within a certain period of time, under observed conditions. Study staff will be measuring how much alcohol you drink at each of these 2 ADP sessions. Each ADP session starts at 8 AM and finishes around 8 PM, for a total of 12 hours.

VA 10-1086Details : 
We ask that you not consume alcohol after 5 pm on the evening prior to each ADP session. When you 
arrive at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC), we will check your breath alcohol level by 
[CONTACT_101615]. If you arrive with a positive breath alcohol level and your breath alcohol level is above 0.00 and/or is increasing, indicating recent alcohol use, then the session will have to be rescheduled. If your breath alcohol level is above 0.[ADDRESS_112434] a urine sample to screen for the use of drugs (e.g. cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], marijuana, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]). 
Then we will measure your height and weight, your heart rate and blood pressure, and ask you to 
complete some assessments and computer tasks. You will be given a light breakfast around 9:00 am, and a late lunch/early dinner around 3:30pm. If you are a smoker, you will be provided with 2 “smoke-breaks” during which you will be escorted out and allowed to smoke up to 2 cigarettes. Non-smokers will also be given the option of taking ‘breaks’ at certain intervals. When you are not completing assessments, you will be able to relax, read a book or be on your cell phone.
Later that same day, you will participate in the ADP. A video camera will be recording this session to 
monitor your drinking behavior.  Prior to the start of this session, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires and rating scales. We will test your breath alcohol level over the course of the ADP and we will test your blood alcohol level once during the ADP. To test your blood alcohol level, about a half-teaspoon of blood (3 ml) will be drawn by [CONTACT_1299] a needle into a vein in your arm.
At [ADDRESS_112435] consume this drink in order to remain in the study.  If you do not wish to consume the drink, you will be discharged from the study.  You will then be monitored for the next 55 minutes and asked to complete some measurements. 
At 1:00 pm you will be given a tray with 4 drinks, each worth $3, for a total of $12. During the next 50 
minutes, you can either choose to drink or keep the money value of the drinks ($3 per each drink that you do not drink).  If you choose the money, it will be given to you after the session is completed.  
At 1:50 pm, the old drinks will be removed.At 2:00 pm you will be given a tray with 4 fresh, new drinks, each worth $3. These will be available to you 
for the next 50 minutes. Again, you can choose to drink them or keep the money. The drinks will be removed at 2:[ADDRESS_112436] of your stay.

7. Can I stop being in the study?
Yes, you can decide to stop at any time. It is important to tell the study research staff if you are thinking 
about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Also, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-investigators may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if they believe it is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped.
8. What side effects or other risks can I expect from being in the study?
The study visits and procedures are designed to limit risks to your health and limit your discomfort as much 
as possible. These procedures closely monitor your safety throughout the study. 
You may have side effects while in the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully 
for any side effects. However, doctors don't know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious. You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects you experience while taking part in the study.
Risks associated with alcohol: 
A number of medical conditions could potentially be worsened by [CONTACT_30286], such as liver disease, heart disease, pancreas problems, diabetes, nervous system problems, or stomach and intestine problems.  If you have any of these medical problems, you should not participate in this study. Alcohol may also cause nausea in high doses; however, nausea is not expected at the dose being used in this study. In order to ensure that you do not fall and hurt yourself after consuming alcohol, we will ask you to stay at the SF VA Medical Center until your breath alcohol level returns to 0.02 or less. Alcohol can be addictive. We do not recommend that you continue drinking alcohol in the quantities that will be used in this research study.
Risks associated with alcohol withdrawal : 
We are not going to ask you to change your drinking behavior while you are participating in this study. 
However, you should know that some individuals who suddenly reduce or stop their drinking can experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, shaking, loss of appetite, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_101581], confusion, hallucinations (hearing and seeing things that are not there) and seizures -- but these are extremely rare. We will monitor you very closely for withdrawal symptoms during your daily visits to our clinic. If you experience worsening of withdrawal symptoms, you may have to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101582].

 3.0 Study Enrollment  and Design  
 The study participants will be primarily selected from Vanderbilt’s outpatient clinics and 
the Nashville Veterans Affairs  outpatient clinics.  The study visits will be conducted at the 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) Department of Nephrology Outpatient Clinic 
and Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS) . Institutional review board 
approval and written informed consent will be obtained from all study subjects. Patients meeting inclusion -exclusion criteria will be identified by [CONTACT_802857]. Patients will be first approached by [CONTACT_45914].  Those who express interest will be informed about the study by [CONTACT_44518]. The subjects will be selected based on the above inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
 
  
 All participants will undergo a 4 -week run- in phase  followed by 12 weeks of treatment  
(Dulaglutide 1.5 mg/wk), followed by 4 weeks of follow up after discontinuing the study 
medication  (Figure 5.1) .  
 6.[ADDRESS_1108319] informed consent will 
undergo the following procedures:  
 Screening Visit: Patients will have a screening visit 4 weeks prior to the beginning of the 
study intervention to confirm that they meet the inclusion- exclusion criteria.  Subjects will be 
presented detailed information regarding the study with an opportunity to discuss the study as 
needed for a complete consent discussion. This visit will include a medical history extracted 
from the patients’ medical records, demographic information, a medication history, HbA1c test 
(for patients with T2D), 12-lead electro cardiogram, vital signs  and BMI measurement, urine,  
or blood pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential)  and serum creatinine test to 
confirm eGFR . Since the presence of any metal introduces unnecessary risk for MRI , a 
screening X -ray exam will be performed to confirm the absence of any metal in subjects where 
that is a possibility.  
Visit 1 (Week - 4): The purpose of this visit is to determine baseline characteristics of the 
patients enrolled. We will review medical records , obtain dietary and physical activity recalls  

Date: 12/ 2/[ADDRESS_1108320].   
Visit 2 (Week 0): Prior to the first dose of the drug, we will review medical records, 
measure vital signs , perform anthropometric measurements , obtain 12- lead electrocardiogram , 
dietary and physical activity recalls, laboratory tests in blood and urine , six-minute walk test 
and perform MRI and 31P MRS  (Table 6.1).  
The first dose of the study drug Dulaglutide (Trulicity®)  will be administered while the 
participant is at the Nephrology Outpatient Clinic . Patients will be instructed on administration 
and given information about the instructions for use. Participants will administer dulaglutide on a weekly basis. S afety measures and compliance will be assessed for each patient by [CONTACT_802858].   
Visit 3 (Week  12):  We will perform the same procedures as week 0 at week 12  (Table 
6.1). Study drug administration will be terminated with the last dose given within 7 days before 
Visit 3 .
 
Visit 4 (Week  16):  We will perform the same procedures as week 0 at week 16  (Table 
6.1).

Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Intermuscular Fat  (IMAT) Measurements  
On the same day as  the VUMC Nephrology Outpatient Clinic Visits , patients will undergo 
MRI to measure VAT and IMAT. Intermuscular fat will be calculated using consecutive cross -
sectional images of the mid -thigh region between the patella and ischial spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] . The analysis will 
be performed in all the quadriceps muscle heads using a custom -written Matlab (Mathwworks, 
Natick, MA) program, as previously described 5, 6.  IMAT will be defined as the fat beneath the 
deep fascia of the muscle. IMAT infiltration will be quantified as the ratio between IMAT and 
muscle volumes 6. 
 
31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy  
We will measure in vivo knee extensor’s mitochondrial function using 31P-MRS to obtain 
the phosphocreatine recovery time constant, a measure of mitochondrial function, as we 
described previously 6. During the 2 days prior to testing, we will ask that subjects 1) to perform 
no moderate or heavy intensity exercise within 1 day of testing; 2) not to consume alcohol 
within the 1 day prior to testing; 3) not to consume caffeine or use tobacco within 6 hours prior 
to testing; and 4) not to eat a meal 3 -6 hours before testing. Mitochondrial function will be 
evaluated using the non- invasive technique 31P-MRS, which provide s the quantification and 
kinetics  of phosphocreatine ( PCr), other phosphate -energy car rier molecules , and inorganic 
phosphate  in limb muscles.  Each subject will lie prone for approximately 30 minutes with a coil 
positioned over the belly of the vastus lateralis muscle. The position of the coil will be confirmed using scout localizer images and a reference positioned within the center of the coil  
(Figure 6.1.A).  
 
After basal measurements, subjects will be asked to perform cycles of knee extension and 
rest using a research exercise device. Measurements will be recorded during the exercise 
protocol  (approximately 90 seconds)  and for additional 5 minutes (recovery period). We will 
repeat the exercise and recovery  cycle at least two times.  Spectra will be used to  evaluate the 
kinetics of PCr . The primary endpoint  will be the half -time of PCr  recovery (time to achieve 
half of basal concentration during the recovery period). A spectra obtained by [CONTACT_802863] 6.1.B. This method is reliable and reproducible and has been considered the “gold standard” to measure mitochondr ial function 
7, 8.  
 
Six-Minute Walk Test  
On the same day  of VUMC Nephrology Outpatient Clinic  Visits, we will measure 
physical performance by  [CONTACT_51567]-minute walk test. This test will be performed as previously 

Date: 12/ 2/[ADDRESS_1108322], but they will be informed about  the time remaining. The detailed time schedule of the study procedures is  shown 
in Table 6.1.  
 Study Drug Administration Dulaglutide (Trulicity®) will be supplied as a 1.5 mg/0.5 mL single dose pen- injector for 
subcutaneous administration. Drug will be dispensed by [CONTACT_44518]. Drug will be provided to the participant as  labelled by [CONTACT_2299]’s name [CONTACT_802864]/monthly . A 
sharps container and injection cleaning supplies will be provided to the participant. Each participant will be instructed how to self -administer the study drug.  Patients will be asked to 
administer dulaglutide subcutaneously once weekly, on the same day of the week, independent of meals, at any time of the day (but always at the same time of the day in subsequent 
administrations) in abdomen, thigh or upper arm and will be advised to rotate the injection site. 
In T2D patients who are using concomitant insulin secretagogues (i.e., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogues will be reduced (i.e., by [CONTACT_31806] -half) to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycemia.     
 Dietary recall  
 The participants will be asked to list the food and beverages you consume for 2 days (one 
weekday and one weekend day) and bring it back at your next visit (dietary recall). We will ask 
the patient to complete a diet recall form. The form is to ease patients to remember their diet and to increase the accuracy of diet recalls. Patients will be given the forms prior to their study visits. They will document everything they eat and drink on a weekday and on a weekend day.  
 
 Activity Monitor ( Physical A ctivity R ecall ) 
 The physical activity monitor is about the size of a watch. It is worn on your non- dominate 
wrist (for example your left wrist if you are right -handed). Participants will wear this monitor 
for 7 days. They will wear it 24 hours per day, including when they  sleep, shower, or do any 
other activities. We will also provide a physical activity log to document physical activity 
during the day.

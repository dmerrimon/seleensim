1. STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Title: A Phase 3, Open- Label,  Safety and Tolerability Study of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] for the 
Treatment of Tardive Dyskinesia  
Protocol Number:  NBI-[ZIP_CODE] -1402 
Development Phase : Phase 3  
Study Site s: Approximately 50 study site s in North America and Puerto Rico.  
Study Objectives:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] ( titrated from  40 to 80  mg) 
administered once daily for up to 12 months for the treatment of Tardive 
Dyskinesia (TD).  
Overview of Study 
Design: This is a Phase 3, open- label, fixed -dose titration study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] (titrated from  40 mg to 80 mg) administered once 
daily (qd) for a total of [ADDRESS_10593] sign an informed consent form ( ICF) prior to the conduct of 
any study related procedures, including washout of medications disallowed in 
the study.  Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator (or 
designee) must determine whether the subject has the capacity to provide consent for study participation using the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC).  Only subjects wh
o are 
deemed to have the capacity to provide consent may sign the ICF .  Subjects 
will also be asked to sign an optional release form to allow their Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) video recordings to be used for 
educational purposes.  Subjects will be screened for eligibility for up to 6 weeks prior to Day -1 (basel ine visit ). 
On Day -1, eligible subjects will receive a supply of NBI-[ADDRESS_10594] 4 weeks of the treatment period.  Beginning on Day 1, s tudy drug will be 
self-adminis tered at home (in the presence of their caregiver, if applicable) in 
the morning between 0700- [ADDRESS_10595]’s dose to [ADDRESS_10596]’s current dose.  A dose escalation will  be allowed at 
the end of Week 4 if (1) the investigator or designee ’s assessment of the 
Clinical Global Impression – Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI -TD) is “minimally 
improved”, “not changed” , “minimally worse”, “much worse” , or “very much 
worse”, and (2) the safety and tolerability of the current dose is acceptable as 
determined by a physician.  The subject will then continue at the 80 mg dose until the end of the treatment period (end of Week 48).  
At any time after a dose escalation, the investigator may decrease the dose to [ADDRESS_10597] will then continue at the 40 mg dose until the end of the treatment period (end of 
Week 48).  Subjects who are unable to tolerate the starting dose of 40 m g or 
the resumption of 40 mg will be discontinued from the study.  
Subjects  will return to the study site every 4 weeks  for study assessments and 
dispensation of the study drug.  These visits will occur  in the afternoon between 
1200- 1700 hours at the end of Weeks 4,  8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 52 (or early 
termination) and at any time before [ADDRESS_10598] dose.  F ollow -up assessments 
will be performed at the end of Week 52 ([ADDRESS_10599] dose) or early  
termination.  
Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be assessed at scheduled 
times throughout the study.  The treatment period visits (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48) and the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) 
will h ave a visit window of ±6 days.
  
Study Population:  Approximately 180 medically stable adult male and female subjects with clinical 
diagnos es of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with neuroleptic -induced 
TD or mood disorder with neuroleptic -induced TD will be enrolled.  Of the 
approximately 180 subjects  to be enrolled, approximately 60% may have  
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .  The subjects must be 18 to 85 years 
of age (inclusive) and have moderate or severe symptoms of TD as assessed by a blinded, external AIMS reviewer
, based on the subject’s AIMS video 
recording conducted at screening.  Subjects must be psychiatrically stable as 
determined clinically by [CONTACT_093], including a BPRS score of <50 at 
screening.  
Approximately  50 subjects who participated in and completed any NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 
Phase 2 study, and were compliant with the study procedures,  will be allowed to 
participate in this study.  
Duration of Treatment 
and Study Participation:  The expected duration of study participation for  each subject is approximately 
[ADDRESS_10600], Dose, 
and Mode of 
Administration:  NBI-[ZIP_CODE] will be supplied as capsules containing 40 mg of  
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] ditosylate (dose is of free base).  The doses that will be used in this 
study are: [ADDRESS_10601] 4 oz. of wa ter and can take study drug with or without 
food.

Efficac
y 
Assessments:  The AIMS will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) on 
Day -1 (the day prior to dosing), during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 
12, 24, 36, and 48), and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or early 
termination.  The AIMS will also be conducted at screening to assess the global severity of TD for study eligibility.  At specified timepoints, the AIMS will be video recorded for approximately 10 minutes.  
The AIMS will be assessed in accordance with the AIMS administration 
procedure and scoring guidelines provided by [CONTACT_456] (or designee).  At screening, Day -1, end of Week 8, and at the follow -up visit (end of Week  52) or 
early termination, the AIMS administration will be video recorded following standardized guidelines and the video recordings will be uploaded to a secure central server.   
- At screening, a blinded, external AIMS reviewer will access the central server  to view the recording and evaluate the subject’s global TD severity 
(based on AIMS item 8) and the investigator (or designee) will score AIMS items 1 -12.  
- On Day -1, at the end of Week 8, and at the follow -up visit (end of Week  52) 
or early termination, the AIMS recordings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11136], central AIMS video raters who will score AIMS items 1- 7, using a triple- blind 
consensus scoring process.  
The CGI -TD will be used to rate the investigator’s (or designee’s) assessment 
of the overall global improvement of TD symptoms since initiation of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
dosing, and will be administered during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48) and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or early 
termination.  
The Tardive Dyskinesia Impact Scale (TDIS) and Assessment of Most 
Bothersome Movement in TD (AMBMTD) will be used to evaluate the 
impairment and disability associated with dyskinesia and  to rate the subject’s 
most bothersome movement, respectively.  The TDIS and AMBMTD will be completed by [CONTACT_11137], on Day -1 (the day prior to dosing), 
during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48), and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or early termination.  
The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) will be used to evaluate the 
change in TD symptoms since initiation of the study drug. The PGIC will be 
completed by [CONTACT_11138] (end of  Weeks 4, 8, 12, 
24, 36, and 48) and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or early termination.  
Plasma Drug 
Exposure : Blood samples to evaluate plasma concentrations of NBI -[ZIP_CODE], the active 
metabolite NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and possibly  other metabolites will be collected during 
the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48), and at the 
follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early termination.

Ethical Issues  
4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background  
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a neurological condition characterized by [CONTACT_11141] (ie, tongue, lips, jaw, face) and choreoathetoid 
movements in the limbs and trunk.  Tardive dyskinesia develops with long -term 
neuroleptic drug use and often persists after discontinuation of the offending 
medication.  Only a small proportion of patients who are treated with dopamine receptor blocking drugs develop this syndrome.   While isolated case reports of TD after short -
term exposure exist, most often TD emerges after long -term neuroleptic treatment over 
months to years.  The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM -IV) defines chronic exposure (treatment for 3 months or greater) to 
neuroleptics as the basis for TD diagnosis.  In addition to duration and amount of neuroleptic exposure, other risk factors for TD appear to include older age, schizophrenia and cognitive impairment ( Margolese et al., 2005).  While often of mild 
intensity, moderate to severe TD can be disabling.  Most patients with mild TD are unaware of their involuntary movements and do not seek treatment ( Macpherson and  
Collis, 1992 ).  Severe TD can also cause great bodily harm (eg, lip or tongue 
lacerations, falls), interference with activities of daily living, and social isolation.  
The pathophysiology of TD is not fully understood; however, post -synaptic dopamine 
hypersensitivity in the striatum is the most prominent feature (Margolese et al., 2005). Dysregulation of dopaminergic systems is an integral component of several central 
nervous system ( CNS ) disorders, including other hyperkinetic movement disorders and 
conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  The transporter prot ein 
vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (V MAT2 ) plays an important role in presynaptic 
dopamine release, regulating monoamine uptake from the cytoplasm to the synaptic vesicle for storage and release.  The differential expression of VMAT2 in human brain 
(versus endocrine tissue) makes agents that selectively target VMAT2 potentially useful for the treatment of CNS disorders ( Weihe and Eiden, 2000 ).

Tetrabenazine, a VMAT2 inhibitor and monoamine depletor, was recently approved for 
the treatment of ch orea associated with Huntington’s disease.  Use of tetrabenazine for 
the treatment of TD and a variety of hyperkinetic movement disorders has also been 
described ( Ondo et al, 1999; Jankovic and Beach, 1997).  The beneficial pharmacologic 
effects of tetrabe nazine on the targeted hyperkinetic involuntary movements have been 
documented, as well as the adverse effects associated with excessive monoamine reduction, such as sedation, depression, akathisia and parkinsonism.  The occurrence of these adverse effects  with tetrabenazine have resulted in the need for individualized 
dosing, dose titration, and management of treatment -related side effects.  
The requirement for dose titration with tetrabenazine may be due to its extensive and variable metabolism.  Upon absorption, tetrabenazine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11107] (DHTBZ) which is a mixture of the stereoisomers ( ±)α-DHTBZ and 
(±)β-DHTBZ.  Since ( +)α-DHTBZ is an VMAT2 inhibitor, with potency comparable to 
tetrabenazine, and since very low exposures of tetrabenazine are observed upon its 
oral administration, the therapeutic efficacy of tetrabenazine appears to be derived from 
(+)α-DHTBZ ( Kilbourn et al., 1995; Mehvar et al., 1987; Xenazine
® Package Insert,  
2011).  Metabolism of tetrabenazine to ( ±)α-DHTBZ  and ( ±)β-DHTBZ is highly variable 
between patients and these stereoisomers of DHTBZ exhibit wide -ranging 
pharmacology (ie, binding to off -target protein receptors).  This represents a source of 
added risk to the patient and complication for the physician in terms of actively 
managing a patient’s dosing regimen.  Orally administered NBI -[ZIP_CODE] may provide an 
advantage by [CONTACT_11142]2 inhibitor (+) α−DHTBZ 
(NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) , in a consistent and controlled manner minimizing excessive mono amine 
reduction and off -target effects . 
4.2. NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] is an orally active valine ester prodrug of a VMAT2  inhibitor (NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) and 
is currently under development at Neurocrine Biosciences Inc . (NBI) for the treatment of 
neuroleptic -induced TD, Tourette Syndrome (TS)  and other involuntary movement 
disorders.  NBI -[ZIP_CODE] ( [+]α−dihydrotetrabenazine) is the most potent and selective of 
the four stereoisomers of dihydrotetrabenazine formed upon reduction of tetrabenazine 
(Xenazine® Package Insert , 2011), a  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved 
drug for the treatment of Huntington’s chorea.  NBI -[ZIP_CODE] was designed to deliver  
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] in a controlled fashion with reduced peak plasma concentrations and

NBI-[ZIP_CODE] has been generally well tolerated in single doses up to 300 mg and in 
multiple doses of up to 100 mg.  Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
consistent with the pharmacological effects of monoamine reduction (eg , fatigue, 
insomnia, nervousness) occurred at a lower incidence in the NBI -[ADDRESS_10610] TEAEs were transient and 
considered mild or moderate in intensity.  Thirteen treatment -emergent serious adverse

and drug induced parkinsonism did not worsen during treatment with NBI -[ZIP_CODE].  
Results from a small, open- label Phase 2 study in 6 subjects with schizophrenia or 
schiz oaffective disorder and TD indicated improvement in abnormal involuntary 
movements as measured by [CONTACT_11144] 12 consecutive days of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] dosing 
(4 days each at 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg).  Findings from a second Phase 2 study 
conducted in this patient population, a placebo- controlled crossover study in  
37 subjects, indicated a greater improvement in the AIMS score after 14 days of treatment with NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg compared to placebo.  Preliminary results from two 
more recently completed Phase 2b studies indicated an improvement in the AIMS score 
after 6 weeks of continuous dosing  with either NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg once daily, continuous 
dosing at NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by [CONTACT_11145]-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks (NBI -[ZIP_CODE]- 1201) or 6 weeks of titrated doses 
from 25 mg up to 75 mg NBI -[ZIP_CODE] once daily (NBI -[ZIP_CODE]- 1202).  Preliminary results 
from an open- label safety extension with dosing out to 12 weeks (NBI -[ZIP_CODE]- 1201) 
continued to show benefit in subjects continuing on with NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg  daily dosing 
and also in subjects originally assigned to placebo who went on to receive NBI-[ZIP_CODE]  
50 mg  once daily for the 6 weeks of open- label treatment period.   Results from the  
6-week dose- titration study (NBI- [ZIP_CODE]- 1202)  showed a statistically significant 
reduction in the AIMS dyskinesia total score in the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] group compared to 
placebo.  A statistically significant higher responder rate (ie, ≥50% improvement in 
AIMS dyskinesia total score from baseline) was also observed in the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] group 
compared to placebo.  
4.3. Study Rational e and Selection of Dose  
The present study is a Phase 3, open- label, fixed -dose titration study of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
(titrated from 40 mg to 80 mg) in medically stable subjects with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder  or mood disorder and TD.  Subjects will be required to have 
moderate or severe TD as determined by a blinded, external AIMS reviewer to assure appropriate subject inclusion.  This  study is designed to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] administered for up to 48 weeks for the treatment of TD.  
In the current study, all subjects will receive NBI -[ZIP_CODE] for 48 weeks .  Subjects will 
receive a starting dose of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 40 mg once daily  for 4 weeks .  After 4  weeks ,

subjects may be eligible for a dose escalation  to NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg provided that  (1) the 
investigator or designee’s assessment of the subject’s Clinical Global Impression of 
Change – Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI -TD) is “minimally improved”, “not changed”, 
“minimally worse”, “much worse” or “very much worse” , and (2) the safety and 
tolerability  of the current dose is acceptable as determined by a physician.  The 
investigator will increase the dose for any subject meeting both criteria and may decrease the dose to the previous dose at any time for a subject who is unable to tolerate the dose incr ease; subjects who have had a dose reduction will continue at that 
dose until the e nd of Week 48  (refer to the schematic in Section 16.2).  Subjects  will be 
discontinued from the study if they are unable to tolerate the starting dose (40 mg) , or 
resumption of the starting dose.  This fixed dose titration design, based on Phase [ADDRESS_10612] 
clinical response (eg , ≥50% reduction in dyskinesia) along with good tolerability. It is 
anticipated that approximately 30% of subjects will complete on the 40 mg dose and approximately 70% of subjects on the 80 mg dose.  
Rationale for Dose Selectio n 
Clinical data from TD subjects administered repeated doses of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] from 12.5 mg 
to 100 mg per day indicate that NBI -[ZIP_CODE] is generally well tolerated and associated 
with dose- related efficacy.  Exposure- response analysis indicates that a steady stat e 
Cmax of 20 to 40 ng/mL NBI -[ZIP_CODE] is an appropriate plasma concentration range for 
efficacy.   
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] doses of 40 mg and 80 mg are associated with exposure to the active 
metabolite, NBI -[ZIP_CODE], in the target range of 20 to 40 ng/mL when administered ini tially 
as [ADDRESS_10613] little incremental benefit but increase the risk of adverse 
events ( AEs) reflecting extension of VMAT2 pharmacology. Because many patient -
specific factors appear to influence tolerability and efficacy, clinicians would be guided to start all patients at the lower of two doses.  Preliminary analysis of Phase 2 data 
suggests that these patient -specific factors include body weight, CYP2D6 genotype, 
concomitant medications, comorbid medical conditions and a number of other clinical variables.

6. OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN  
Subjects will provide written informed consent before any study -related procedures , 
including washout of disallowed  medications,  are performed  as described in  
Section  6.1. 
6.1. Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, open- label, dose- titration study to evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] (titrated from 40 mg to 80 mg) administered once daily (qd) for a total of 
48 weeks  of treatment.  Approximately 180 medically stable male and female subjects 
with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with neuroleptic 
induced TD or mood disorder with neurolepti c induced T D will be enrolled.   Of the 
approximately 180 subjects , approximately 60% may have schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder . 
All subjects must sign an ICF prior to the conduct of any study related procedures, 
including washout of medications disallowed in the study.  Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator (or designee) must determine whether the subject has the capacity to provide consent for study participation using the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment  of Capacity to Consent (UBACC). A copy of the 
UBACC is located in Appendix  17.1.  During the initial step of consent pr ocess, the ICF  
will be revie wed with the subject.  The UBACC will then be administered.  Only subjects 
who are deemed to have the capacity to provide consent may sign the ICF. Subjects 
may also be asked to sign an optional release form to allow their AIMS  video recordings 
to be used for educational purposes.  After providing informed consent, the subjects will 
be screened for eligibility for up to 6 weeks prior to Day -1 (baseline visit)  (Week -6 to 
Day -1). 
On Day -1, eligible subjects will receive a supply of NBI-[ADDRESS_10614] 
4 weeks of the treatment period.  Beginning on Day 1, study drug will be self -
administered at home (in the presence of their caregiver, if applicable) in the morning between [ADDRESS_10615]’s dose to [ADDRESS_10616]’s current dose.  A dose escalation will be allowed at the end of Week 4 if (1) the investigator or designee’s  assessment of the CGI -TD is “minimally 
improved”, “not changed” , “minimally worse”, “much worse” , or “very much worse”, and 
(2) the safety and tolerability of the current dose is acceptable  as determined by a 
physic ian.   The subject will then continue at the 80 mg dose until the end of the 
treatment period (end of Week 48).  
At any time after a dose escalation, the investigator may decrease the dose to [ADDRESS_10617] will then continue at the 
40 mg  dose until the end of the treatment period (end of Week 48).  Subjects who are 
unable to tolerate the starting dose of 40 mg, or the resumption of 40  mg, will be 
discontinued from the study  (refer to the schematic in Section 16.2).

Subjects  will return to the study site every 4 weeks in the afternoon  for study 
assessments and dispensation of the study drug .  These visits will occur  in the 
afternoon between 1200- 1700 hours at the end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 52 (or 
early termination) and at any time before [ADDRESS_10618] dose.  Follow -up assessments will be performed at the end of 
Week  52 ([ADDRESS_10619] dose) or early termination.  
Efficacy , safety, and PK  will be assessed at scheduled times throughout the study.  The 
treatment period visits (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48) and the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) will have a visit window of ±6 days . 
A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
6.1.1. Efficacy, Blood Sample Collections, and Safety Assessments for All 
Subjects  
Efficacy assessments will  be performed using the AIMS, the CGI -TD, the Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC), the Tardive Dyskinesia Impact Scale (TDIS), and the Assessment of Most Bothersome Movement in Tardive Dyskinesia (AMBMTD) .  The 
AIMS will be administe red at screening, on Day -1 (the day prior to dosing), during the 
treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48), and at the follow -up visit (end 
of Week 52) or early termination.  The AIMS will b e administered and scor ed by [CONTACT_1275] (or designee) in accordance with the AIMS administration procedure and scoring guidelines provided by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) .  At screening,  Day -1, end of 
Week 8 , and at the follow -up visit  (end of Week 52) or early termination, the AIMS 
assessment will be video recorded (approximately 10 minutes) following standardized guidelines and the video recording will be uploaded to a secure central server.  At 
screening, a blinded, external AIMS reviewer will access the central server to view the 
recoding and evaluate the subject’s global TD severity (based on AIMS item 8).  The subject must have moderate or severe TD as determined by [CONTACT_11146], external reviewer to be eligible for study participation.  The investigator or designee will score 
AIMS items 1 -10 and complete AIMS items 11- 12. The AIMS video recording conducted 
on Day -1, at the end of Week 8 , and at the follow -up visit  (end of Week 52) or early 
termination  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11136], central AIMS video raters who will score AIMS 
items 1 -7 using a triple -blind  consensus scoring process.   Refer to Sections [IP_ADDRESS] , 
[IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]  for details.   
The CGI -TD will be used to rate the investigator or designee’s  assessment of the overall 
global improvement of TD symptoms since initiation of study drug dosing, and will be administered during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48) and at 
the follow -up visit  (end of Week 52) or early termination.   
The PGIC will be used to evaluate the change in TD symptoms since initiation of study drug dosing, and will be completed by [CONTACT_11138] (end of

termination.  
A patient reported outcome, the TDIS  and AMBMTD  will be used to assess the 
impairment and disability associated with dyskinesia and to rate the subject’s most 
bothersome movement, respectively .  The TDIS will be completed by [CONTACT_11147], on Day -1 (the day prior to dosing), during the treatment period (end of 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48), and at the follow -up visit  (end of Week 52) or at early 
termination.  
The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) will be performed at screening as an 
assessment of the severity of psychopathology to determine study eligibility.  
Blood samples for plasma drug concentration analysis will be collected during the study. A blood sample will be collected from enrolled subjects on Day -1 and analyzed to 
determine CYP2D6 status.   Plasma samples for an exploratory assessment of 
biomarkers associated with the metabolic profile of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] will be collected during 
the study . 
Safety and tolerability assessments including AE monitoring, clin ical laboratory tests 
(including hematology, clinical chemistry, prolactin, and urinalysis), vital sign 
measurements, PE,  and 12- lead ECG  will be conducted at scheduled times throughout 
the study .  Suicidal ideation and behavior will be evaluated using the Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) and the 
Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS) will be used to assess the presence and severity of drug -
induced akathisia and drug -induced extrapyramidal symptoms, respectively.  
6.1.2. Additional Safety Assessments for Subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder:  
Depressive symptoms will be evaluated using the Calgary Depression Scale for 
Schizophrenia (CDSS).  Psychiatric symptoms will be assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) . 
6.1.3. Additional Safety Assessments for Subjects with Mood Disorder:  
The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) will be used to assess manic  symptoms .  
Depressive symptoms will be evaluated with the Montgomery -Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS) conducted using the Structured Interview Guide for MADRS (SIGMA).

8.2. Screening Assessment  
8.2.1. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) 
The BPRS is a clinician -rated tool designed to assess the severity of psychopathology 
in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Overall and Gorham,  
1962, 1988).  The BPRS includes [ADDRESS_10648], excitement, and disorientation.   
The severity of each of the 18 items of the BPRS is rated on a scale of 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe) (score range: 18 to 126). Higher scores represent greater 
symptom severity.    
The investigator or other qualified site personnel will administer and score the scale at 
screening , and subjects must have a BPRS total score <50 to be eligible for study 
participation (see exclusion criterion #5 ).  A copy of the BPRS is provided in 
Appendix  17.2.  
8.3. Efficacy Assessment s 
8.3.1. Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS)  
The severity of TD will be assessed using the AIMS  rating scale.  This scale was 
developed by [CONTACT_11152] ( Guy, 1976 a).  The AIMS rates a total of 10 items with 9  items rating 
involuntary movem ent from 0 (no dyskinesia) to 4 (severe  dyskinesia ).  Items 1 through 
7 include facial and oral movements  (Items 1 -4), extremity movements  (Items 5 -6), and 
trunk movements  (Item 7).  The AIMS dyskinesia t otal scor e for Items 1 -7 ranges from 
0 to 28; a higher score reflects  increased severity .  Items 8, [ADDRESS_10649]’s report of his/her awareness 
of abnormal movements from 0 (no awareness) to 4 (aware, severe distress) .  Items 
11-12 are yes-no questions concerning problems with teeth and/or dentures.   A copy of 
the AIMS is located in Appendix  17.3.  
The AIMS will be administered at the study site and conducted according to an AIMS 
administration procedure provided by [CONTACT_11153].  The AIMS will be 
administered and scored by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) using the AIMS scoring 
descriptor s provided by [CONTACT_11148]  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   Subjects will be video recorded 
according to standardized guidelines for the duration of the AIMS structured 
examination at screening, Day -1, end of Week 8 , and at the follow -up visit  (end of 
Week 52) or early termination.  In order to qualify for the study, subjects must have 
moderate or severe TD at screening as determined by a blinded, external AIMS 
reviewer  based on the AIMS video recording (see inclusion criterion #6  and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).   The investigator (or des ignee) will score AIMS items 1 -10 and 
complete AIMS items 11- 12.

The AIMS will be a dministered at screening, Day -1, during the treatment period (end of 
Weeks 4, 8,  12, 24, 36, and 48) and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early 
termination.  At each timepoint, the AIMS will be administered in the afternoon, between 
1200- 1700 hours.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  AIMS Administration and Scoring  
During the study , the AIMS will be administered at the study site by [CONTACT_093] (or 
designee) according to the AIMS administration procedure.   AIMS items 1-10 will be 
scored and items 11 -12 will be completed by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) 
administering the AIMS , based on the AIMS scoring descriptors provided by [CONTACT_11148]  (see 
Appendix 17.3) .  If possible, the same person should administer  and score the AIMS 
assessment for  an individual subject at all time points.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  AIMS Video Recording and Blinded, External AIMS Reviewer  
At screening,  Day -1, end of Week 8, and at the follow -up visit  (end of Week 52) or early 
termination, subjects will be video recorded for the duration of the AIMS administration  
(approximately 10 minutes) according to standardized guidelines  provided by [CONTACT_11154].  Video recordings will be uploaded to a secur e, central AIMS 
server within approximately [ADDRESS_10650]’s AIMS video 
recording.  The screening AIMS  video recording uploaded to the server will be viewed 
by [CONTACT_11146], external AIMS reviewer  and the sponsor -designated representatives .  
The blinded external AIMS reviewer will review the video recordings for the following 
purposes: (1) determine if the subject has moderate or severe TD at screening  (see 
inclusion criterion  #6), and (2) determine if the AIMS was admini stered  according to the 
AIMS administration procedure and video recorded according to the standardized 
guidelines  (additional timepoints may be reviewed if warranted) .  In addition, the study 
center will be asked to submit the original uncompressed AIMS video recording to a core laboratory using an encrypted (password protected) device (eg,  flash drive).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Blinded, Central AIMS Video Raters  
The AIMS video recording files for Day -1, end of Week 8 , and at the follow -up visit  (end 
of Week 52) or early termination will be reviewed and scored by [CONTACT_11136], central AIMS 
video raters .  A blinded consensus scoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_11155] (see Section  16.3).  NBI (or designee) will 
provide the blinded central AIMS video raters an external hard drive containing subjects’ randomized AIMS video recording files to review and score.  The central raters will be blinded to the subjects study visits and study drug dose. Two blinded, central raters will together review each AIMS video file from beginning to end and must agree on the 
score (0 to 4) for AIMS items 1- 7.  The central AIMS video raters will review and score 
the AIMS video recordings conducted on Day -1 (baseline) , at the end of Week 8, and 
at the follow -up visit  (end of Week 52) or early terminati on.

8.3.2. Clinical Global Impression – Global Improvement of Tardive Dyskinesia 
(CGI-TD) 
The CGI -TD, which is based on a 7- point scale (range: 1=very much improved to 
7=very much worse) , will be used to rate the overall global improvement of TD since the 
initiation of dosing .  This scale is a modification of a scale developed by [CONTACT_11156]’s overall improvement in clinical disorder and provides a global evaluation of 
improvement over time from the clinician’s perspective ( Guy, 1976b).    
The investigator or qualified clinician designee (eg, psychologist or social worker) will 
rate the scale at the scheduled times .  If possible, t he same person should rate the 
CGI-TD at all timepoints.   The CGI -TD is one of the assessments that will be used by 
[CONTACT_11157] a subject is eligible for dose escalation at the end of 
Week 4 .  A dose escalation will be allowed at the end of Week 4 if (1) the investigator or 
designee’s assessment of the CGI -TD is “minimally improved”, “not changed”, 
“minimally worse”, “much worse”, or “very much worse”, and (2) the safety and tolerability of the current dose is acceptable as determined by a phys ician.   
The CGI -TD will be administer ed during the treatment period ( end of Weeks  4, 8, 12, 
24, 36, and 48), and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early termination.  A 
copy of the CGI -TD is located in Appendix  17.4.   
8.3.3. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
Subjects will evaluate the change in their TD symptoms since the initiation of study drug dosing choosing one of 7 responses (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, not changed, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse).  The PGIC will be completed by [CONTACT_11138] (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48), and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early termination A 
copy of the P GIC is located in Appendix  17.5. 
 
8.3.4. Tardive Dyskinesia Impact Scale (TDIS)  and Assessment of Most 
Bothersome Movement in Tardive Dyskinesia (AMBMTD)  
The TDIS  and AMBMTD, patient reported outcomes, will be used to assess the 
impairment and disability associated with dyskinesia and the subject’s most bothersome 
TD move ment .  The TDIS  and AMBMTD  will be completed by [CONTACT_11158], 
Day -1, during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48),  and at the

For each plasma sample, approximately 2 mL of blood will be collected in tubes 
containing di potassium ethylenediaminetetraaceti c acid ( K2 EDTA ).  Once obtained, the 
samples  should be thoroughly mixed.  If the sample is not centrifuged immediately, the 
collection tube will be placed upright in a test tube rack and kept on crushed ice.  Within 
1 hour of collection, samples will be c entrifuged at approximately 2,000 g for 
10 minutes , preferably under refrigerated conditions (2 to 8°C).  The separated plasma 
will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_11117] a disposable pi[INVESTIGATOR_11118].  The vials will be stoppered and labeled with the study barcode,

and nominal study date.  The samples will be stored at approximately -20°C within 
approximately 15 minutes  of centrifugation.  The date and actual 24- hour clock time of 
each collection will be recorded on the eCRF.  The duplicate plasma sample at each 
timepoint  will be stored and used as backup.  These samples  (including a manifest with 
additional information)  will be shipped to a central laboratory for analysis  preferably on 
the day of collection to be stored at approximately -70°C .  Plasma samples remaining at 
the end of the study may be used for exploratory assessments.  
8.5. Safety Assessments  
8.5.1. Safety Assessments for All Subjects  
Concomitant medication use and AEs will be monitored throughout the study as described in Sections 8.9.[ADDRESS_10652] results obtai ned at the follow -up visit or at early termination, until the value returns 
to baseline (or  within normal limits), or the investigator deems the abnormality to be of 
no clini cal significance .  If the i nvestigator determines that a subject has a clinically 
significant finding of t reatment -emergent depression, suicidal ideation, psychiatric 
symptoms  (based upon the C -SSRS, CDSS , MADRS  (SIGMA), PANSS , YMRS,  or 
clinical assessment), the finding will be documented as an AE,  and appropriate 
psychiatric evaluation and intervention will provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medical History  
A general medical history will be obtained at screening and will be updated upon entry into the study on Day -1.  
The subject’s psychiatric history will be document ed and will include the subject ’s age at 
first diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder, and age at 
TD diagnosis. If  necessary, subject age at onset can be estimated by [CONTACT_941] i nves tigator 
based upon available clinical information . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical Examination Including Neurological Assessment, Height, and Weight  
A complete physical examination will consist of an assessment of the following: general appearance; skin and mucosa; head, eyes, ears, nose, throat; lymph nodes; 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_10653]/lungs; cardiovascular; abdomen; extremities; musculoskeletal; and neurological 
system.  
A physical examination including weight  will be con ducted at screening , Day -1, during 
the tre atment  period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 1 2, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44,  and 48), and 
at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52 ) or at early termination.   Height will be recorded at 
screening only.  Weight will be recorded with subjects wearing ordinary indoor clothing 
without shoes.  Height and weight  will be used to calculate the BMI (kg/m2). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements, including orthostatic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, orthostatic pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (recorded only supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and oral body temperature will be measure d.  Blood pressure will be measured using a calibrated automatic blood 
pressure cuff after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_10654] for 30 seconds.  
Vital sign measurements will be obtained before any scheduled blood sample collection 
at screening, Day -1, during the treatme nt period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 
32, 36, 40, 44, and 48), and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early 
termination.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Twelve -lead Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be conducted in triplicate (1 to 3 minutes apart) after the 
subject has rested supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes .  The ECG parameters to be assessed 
include heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration,  QT interval , and QTcF  interval (machine 
readings  or calculated ).  Additionally, the occurrence of de- and re -polar ization and 
rhythm disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed.  Based on r eview of these 
parameters, the investigator or designee will note if the ECG is Normal, Abnormal not Clinically Significant, or Abnormal Clinically Significant.  
The E CGs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_093], and if needed, the findings will be 
confirmed by a cardiologist or internist.  Any medically important changes in ECG parameters compared with baseline (Day -1) will be documented on the AE eCRF.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  – Columbia -Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and 
behavior  (http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu).  There are versions of the questionnaire 
designed for use at screening (Baseline/Screening version) and at baseline (Day -1) 
and visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit Version).  All versions of the C -SSRS 
include a series of screening questions related to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of ‘yes’ to one or more screening questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal 
ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C -SSRS in the [ADDRESS_10658] visit on Day -1should be excluded (see exclusion 
criterion #6 ).  A copy of the C -SSRS (Screening/Baseline and Since Last V isit versions) 
is provided in Appendix  17.7. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_10659] completed C -SSRS certification.  The C -SSRS will be administered 
at screening, Day -1, during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 
32, 36, 40, 44, and 48) , and at  the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early 
termination.  The “Screening/Baseline” version of the scale will be used to evaluate  
subject eli gibility at screening and the ‘Since Last Visit’ version will be used at all other 
timepoints.  
If at any time after baseline (Day -1) the subject’s response to the suicidal ideation 
section of the C -SSRS is worse than the baseline (Day -1) asse ssment, it will be 
document ed as an AE.  All suicidal behaviors will be documented as an AE.  
Appropriate psychiatric evaluation and intervention will be provided for any treatment -
emergent suicidal behavior or clinically significant suicidal ideation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eva luation of Akathisia and Extrapyramidal Symptoms - Barnes Akathisia 
Rating Scale and Simpson- Angus Scale  
The BARS  is a validated four -item scale to assess the presence and severity of drug -
induced akathisia ( Barnes, 1989).  This scale i ncludes both objecti ve items 
(eg, observed restlessness) and subjective items (eg, subjects awareness of 
restlessness and related distress), together with a global assessment of akathisia.  
Global assessment is made on a scale of 0 to 5 (0=absent; 1=questionable; 2=mild akathisia; 3=moderate akathisia; 4=marked akathisia; 5=severe akathisia).  A copy of 
the BARS in included in Appendix  17.8.   
The SAS is a validated 10- item scale to evaluate the presence and severity of drug -
induced parkinsonism and other extrapyramidal  symp toms ( Simpson and Angus, 1970).  
The 10 items focus on clinician -assessed rigidity and each item is rated on a 0 to 4 
scale of increasing severity with definitions given for each anchor point.  The SAS will 
also be used as a screening tool; subjects will be excluded if they have a score ≥ 3 on 
two or more items  at screening or Day -1, excluding Items 8 and 10 (see exclusion 
criterion  #3).  A copy of the SAS in included in Appendix  17.9.  
The investigator or other  qualif ied site personnel will administer and score the BARS 
and SAS at Day -1, during t he treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48), 
and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early termination .  The SAS is also 
administered and scored at screening .  If possible, the same person should administer 
and score these scales at all timepoints.  
8.5.2. Safety Assessments in Subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Symptoms of Schizophrenia – Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS) for Schizophrenia  
The PANSS is a validated clinical instrument used for measuring symptom reduction in patients with schizophrenia (Kay et al., 1987 ).  The scale is divided into three sections 
with s even items designed to evaluate positive symptoms (symptoms of the disease 
which manifest as the presence of traits), seven items designed to evaluate negative 
symptoms (symptoms that manifest as the absence of traits), and 16 items which

(0=absent; 1=minimal; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=moderate severe; 5=severe; 6=extreme).  
The scale also includes three supplementary items that constitute an aggression risk 
profile; however, these items will not be scored as they are not applicable to the study.  
Subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder must have a PANSS total score of <70 at Day -1 to be eligible for enroll ment  (see exclusion criterion #22).  A copy of the 
PANSS questions and rating criteria is provided in Appendix  17.10.  
The PANSS will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_11162] -1, during the treatment period (end of Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48) , 
and at the follow -up visit (end of Week 52) or at early termination.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS)  
The CDSS  is a validated nine- item scale to assess depressive symptoms  in patients 
with schizophrenia ( Addington et al., 1990).  All nine items are scored on a scale of 0 to 
3 (0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe) and the CDSS depression total score is obtained by [CONTACT_11163].  The CDSS will be used to evaluate depressive symptoms  throughout the study.  The CDSS will also be used as a 
screening tool; subjects  with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  must have a 
score <10 at screening and Day -1 (see exclusion criterion # 21).  A copy of the CDSS is 
provided in Appendi x 17.11 .

Dose Titration Assessment 
At the end of Week 4 , a dose escalation may be allowed if (1) the  subject’s CGI-TD is 
“minimally improved” , “not ch anged”, ” minimally worse”, “m uch worse”, or “very much 
worse”  as determined by [CONTACT_1719], and (2) the safety and tolerability 
of the current dose is acceptable as determined by a physician.  Based these criteria, 
the investigator will choose one of the following dosing options  (also refer to the dose 
titration algorithm  in Section  16.2): 
• Dose escalation:   The dose of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] will be esc alated from 40 mg qd  to 80 mg 
qd.  
• Maintenance of current dose.  
The investigator  may decrease the dose to 40 mg  at any time after the end of Week 4  
(including between scheduled study visits) for any subject  who is unable to tolerate the 
80 mg dose.  T hese s ubjects will receive 40 mg for the remainder  of the treatment 
period.  
Once a determination of dose escalation, maintenance, or reduction (for subjects who 
had their dose escalated to 80 mg at the end of Week 4)  is made,  the IWRS will be 
accessed to obtain an identification number for a kit containing a 4-week supply of study  
drug to be dispensed to the subject .  The investigator will inform the subject that a dose 
reduction to [ADDRESS_10668] is unable to  tolerate the 80 mg dose.   
At these  visits, subjects will be reminded: 
• To take study drug (in the presence of their caregiver, if applicable) each morning at 
approximately the same time every day (between 0700- 1000 hours ).  The subjects 
may take the study drug with or without food and must swallow it with a t least [ADDRESS_10669] take the study medication daily as instructed.

study file.   
All returned study drug and study drug materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and returned according to applicable state  and federal regulations and study 
procedures.   
10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by [CONTACT_423], noted from 
laboratory findings, or identified by [CONTACT_11174], will be recorded from the time the 
subject signed the ICF until the subject’s final study visit (end of Week 52 or early 
termination) .  
10.1.  Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  During the study, clinically significant 
adverse changes in clinical status , ECGs, laboratory values (not associated with an AE 
or concurrent medical condition), or physical examinations are considered AEs.  Any 
subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE. 
Adverse events include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2)  subject 
deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction.  
If at any time after the baseline visit (Day -1) the subject’s response to the suicidal 
ideation section of the C -SSRS is worse than the baseline assessment, it will be 
documented as an AE.  All suicidal behaviors will be documented as an AE.  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_10690], without asking about the occurrence  of 
any specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the 
event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and evaluation, al l AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_11175], must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in ac cordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE 
eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, 
outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study drug.  
The following are not considered AEs: 
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug administration.  
• Recurrence of TD symptoms, unless worsened from baseline.  
• Pregnancy.  
10.1.1. Intensity of Adverse Events  
Adverse events must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined in Table 4, must be entered on the AE eCRF.   It should be noted 
that the term “severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”  
Table 4. Intensity of Adverse Events  
Grade  Intensity  
Mild An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate  An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
partici pant.  
Severe An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
 
10.1.2. Relationship to Study Drug 
The i nvestigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_11124] 5.  An AE is deemed associated with 
the use of the study drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
AE” (otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. (Title 21 CFR 312.32  [a]).

Table 5. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
Relationship  Description  
Definite A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug or in which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and 
reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure.  
 
Possible  An adv erse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
event.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between  the drug and the adverse event.  
 
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical 
state.  
 
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
 
 
10.2.  Recording Adverse Events 
For enrolled subjects, each AE will be listed as a separate entry on an AE eCRF.  
Screen failure subjects will have AE information noted in the source documentation.  
The i nvestigator or designee will provide information on dates and times of onset and 
resolution, intensity, seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, changes in study drug 
usage, relationship to study drug, and outcome.  
The following categories of medical events that could occur during participation in a clinical study must be reported within 24  hours to NBI or its designee:  
• Serious adverse event, including death ( refer to Section 10.4).  
• Pregnancy (Refer to Section 10.5).  
• Events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with 
some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with 
specific plan and intent) based on the C -SSRS.  
10.3.  Post Study Follow -Up of Adverse Events 
All AEs, including clinically significan t changes in ECGs, physical examination findings, 
or isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  If resolved, a resolution date should be documented on the eCRF.   
Adverse events ongoing at the final study visit or early termination will be followed for as 
long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes or resolves or  until the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may 
be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory t ests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals, as is practical.

10.4.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following  outcome:  
• Death.  
• A life -threatening adverse event.   Life-threatening means that the s ubject was, in the 
view of the i nvestigator  or sponsor , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred.  It does not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if 
it occurred in a more serious form . 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11126] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen during the 
clinical investigation is not considered an AE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11127].  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], and if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is considered serious.  Treatment in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11128] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• A persistent  or sig nificant incapacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life func tions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical event s that may not result in death, be life- threatening,  or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  These events  may be considered serious when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
Any o ther event thought by [CONTACT_11177], 
following the reporting requirements detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
10.4.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events  
Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as soon as possible.  The physician in attendance will do whatever is medically  needed for the safety and well -being of the subject.  The subject will remain 
under observation as long as medically indicated.   Appropriate laboratory tests  will be 
conducted until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE resolves or until the subject  is medically 
stabilized.  The i nvestigator or designee will notify the Medical Monitor (and the IRB, if 
necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the SAE and the outcome of the SAE.  
If within the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_10692] dose of study drug (or final study visit, whichever is longer in duration) an investigator  becomes aware of an 
SAE, then the event must be documented  and reported as described in Section  10.4.3.

be submitted to the appropriate IRB  as soon as possible.   Documentat ion of  the 
submission to the IRB  and receipt by [CONTACT_1201] (if applicable) must be retained for each 
safety report.  
10.5.  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE unless the criteria for an SAE  are met.  
Howev er, all pregnancies in female subjects who received NBI -[ADDRESS_10694] be counseled at all visits to continue  
using two forms of nonhorm onal contraception or hormonal contraception (see inclusion 
criterion  #2 in Section 7.1) until the end of the follow -up visit (end of Week 52).  If at any 
time between the time the subject signs the ICF and the last study visit a subject 
believes she is preg nant, the subject will be instructed to stop taking the study 
medication and return to the study site  within [ADDRESS_10695] be immediately 
reported to NBI  (Refer to  Section 10.4.[ADDRESS_10696] information) , and followed by [CONTACT_11181] .  A first trimester ultrasound will be required for 
all confirmed pregnancies.  Pregnancies in subjects who received NBI -[ZIP_CODE] will be

system ( ) provided by .  The E DC 
system and the study -specific eCRFs  will comply with Title [ADDRESS_10697] data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_11182], with the exception of 
data captured in an electronic format, which will be loaded electronically into the appropriate eCRFs .  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by [CONTACT_11183].   The eCRF for each subject must be reviewed by [CONTACT_11184] (s).  This should be done as soon as possible 
after th e subject  completes the study . 
The investigator  or an authorized member of the investigator 's staff will make any 
necessary additions/ corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the 
date, person performing the corrections, and reason for the change will be available via 
the electronic audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  The eCRFs will be reviewed 
periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  NBI will 
also be allowed access to all source documents  and medical records  pertinent to the 
study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11130].  
 will provide access  to the Neurocrine portal of the EDC system for the 
duration of the study  through a password- protected method of internet access.  Such 
access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator  at that time as a durable record of the 
site's eCRF data.  Although not required,  the investigator  may make paper printouts 
from that media.  
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations .  This 
includes an inspection by [CONTACT_11185]/or health authority representatives at any time.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11131] -related records by [CONTACT_11186]/or NBI.

16.3.  Blinded Central AIMS Video Raters’ Consensus Scoring Process  
 
1. The blinded central AIMS video raters must be neurologists who are movement disorder experts.  
2. Each blinded central AIMS video rater will be assigned a unique rater ID number.  
3. The blinded central AIMS raters must complete practice review and consensus scoring of AIMS videos provided by [CONTACT_456] (using AIMS video files from subjects who are not participating in the current study) prior to scoring any study subjects’ AIMS v ideos.  
4. Each AIMS video file to be scored will be assigned a randomization number thereby [CONTACT_11206]’s study visits and dose . 
5. A face -to-face meeting will be set up for two blinded central AIMS video raters to 
meet at a mutual location. The sponsor (or designee) will provide the following 
materials at the meeting for the raters to review and score the AIMS video files:  
• HD TV  
• Laptop computer  
• External Hard Drive containing study subjects’ randomized AIMS video files.  
• AIMS paper C ase Report Form (CRF). 
6. At the meeting, two blinded central AIMS video raters will together review each video file from beginning to end.  If required, the raters can review each video multiple times but must not re- review the video file after scores have been generated.  
7. The two blinded, central AIMS video raters will score AIMS Items 1- 7.  Both must 
agree (have consensus) on a score (0 to 4) based on the following AIMS descriptors.  
 
Score Descriptors  
0 No dyskinesia  
1 Minimal or Slight dyskinesia:  Low amplitude, present during some but not 
most of the exam  
2 Mild dyskinesia:  Low amplitude and present during most of exam (or moderate 
amplitude and present during some of exam)  
3 Moderate dyskinesia:  Moderate amplitude and present duri ng most of exam  
4 Severe dyskinesia: Maximal amplitude and present during most of exam  
 
8. One of the blinded central AIMS video raters will enter the item scores on a paper 
CRF for each AIMS video file rev iewed.  Both raters will complete the rater ID 
number, and sign and date each paper CRF in the space provided.  
9. The completed paper CRF  will be collected by [CONTACT_11207].

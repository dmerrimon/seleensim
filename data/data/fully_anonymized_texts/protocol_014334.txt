Study Summary: This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_273113] a
mechanism produced by [CONTACT_273179] (PNS) to reduce hemiplegic
shoulder pain (HSP). Thirty subjects will enroll and receive a 3-week course of
percutaneous IM PNS at one of [ADDRESS_333728] IM PNS treatment (15,120 total contractions), IM PNS at half the standard
dose (7,560 total contractions), or IM PNS at 1.[ADDRESS_333729] dose (22,680
total contractions). Dose will be controlled by [CONTACT_273180]
(3h, 6h, or 9h) while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_273114]. Subjects will be
followed for 12 weeks after treatment.  
Baseline Variables and Randomization: Baseline data will be collected so that the
balance of covariates across the three groups can be evaluated. Each participant will
be characterized with respect to demographics, comorbidities, and medication use.If this field is not completed your
protocol will not be reviewed. Do

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 14/71Study outcome measures (see Outcomes Assessment) will be administered to
establish baseline levels. Participants are assigned to treatment groups using an
adaptive randomization algorithm [76-78] to minimize group imbalances on key
patient characteristics: baseline pain (>6 or <=6) [79], duration of pain (>=18
months or <18 months) [5], and age (>=55 years or <55 years). For each
assignment, the algorithm calculates the balance of these variables across the
groups and makes an assignment that would result in greater balance in the
variables across groups.  
Percutaneous PNS System: The Sprint PNS System (SPR Therapeutics, Cleveland,
OH), also known as the Smartpatch System, will be used to deliver the PNS therapy.
The System consists of a small external stimulator, percutaneous lead, and pad. The
external stimulator “snaps” on to the pad. The pad has an embedded power source
for the System but also serves as the anode. The pad is replaced regularly based on
treatment parameters, allowing the investigative team to prescribe the total dosage
based upon the number of pads. The single-channel stimulator outputs a biphasic
current waveform with current pulse parameter ranges that are suitable for PNS.
These electrodes have been used extensively to deliver percutaneous PNS to
shoulder muscles. [6-12, 62, 71]  
Lead Placement Procedure: The procedure will be performed under a sterile
condition. The location and depth of the electrode implant site are determined b y
monopolar needle stimulation with demonstration of strong contraction of both the
middle and posterior deltoid muscles. [6, 9, 62, 70] The introducer loaded with the
lead is inserted perpendicular to the skin surface and advanced to the depth (3-4
cm) defined by [CONTACT_273181]. The introducer is then withdrawn
with the electrode retained in the muscle b y a barb at its tip .PNS Treatment Protocol: After one week for lead stabilization [80], the Sprint PNS
System will be programmed for stimulation. Based on over 30-yrs of experience, the
Cleveland FES Center established parameters for safe and effective delivery of PNS
(pulse frequency = 12 Hz; pulse amplitude = 20 mA; pulse duration = 5-200 usec
(set by [CONTACT_30223]); duty cycle = 5-sec ramp-up, 10-sec plateau, 5-sec ramp down, 10
sec off; daily stim time (randomized) = 3, 6, 9 hrs/day; total contraction dose
(randomized) = 7560, [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE] contractions). [81] These parameters provide
strong fused comfortable muscle contraction with minimal fatigue. [6-12, 49, 62,
71,82-84] Stimulation frequency and amplitude are fixed. The pulse duration is set
to produce strong, comfortable contraction of both the middle and posterior deltoids.
A balanced biphasic waveform allows an equal amount of current to flow in either
phase, creating a safe net zero charge. [85] In this dose-response study, participants
receive 3h, 6h, or 9h of stimulation each day. The stimulator keeps an electronic log
for compliance monitoring.  
Electrode and Electrode Site Surveillance and Electrode Removal: All caregivers and
participants will be trained in the assessment of electrode site and the daily
placement of the Sprint Pad. The caregiver conducts daily inspections to detect
complications. The nurse coordinator inspects the site for infection and performs
motor/sensory threshold testing for lead migration and lead integrity, respectively, at
the following times: within 48-72 hrs of lead placement, at the beginning of PNS
treatment, and at the end of treatment. Inspection and testing of motor/sensory
thresholds and impedance may also occur anytime during the 3-wk PNS treatment
period as deemed necessary. At the end of treatment, the electrode is removed by
[CONTACT_273182]. All participants undergo r adiographic
surveillance for retained electrode fragments.  
Outcomes Assessment: The primary outcome measure is the worst pain in the prior
7-days (BPI [CONTACT_67307]-3). Secondary measures include pain interference with ADLs (BPI [CONTACT_67307]-
9); QoL (SF-36); shoulder impairment (isometric voluntary abduction shoulder
torque (IVAST), shoulder kinematic analysis, optional Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment
(upper limb)); and measures of central sensitization (mechanical pain thresholds for
hyperalgesia, optional pi[INVESTIGATOR_273115], temporal summation
of repetitive pin-prick stimuli). Other optional measures include tactile/touch,
vibration and thermal/thermal pain detection thresholds, temporal summation of
repetitive thermal stimuli, and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM). Details for each
measure are presented below. The outcomes are administered face-to-face in a
blinded manner.Brief Pain Inventory SF-3: The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_273116] [86-92] and is
recommended by [CONTACT_273183].

assessment of participants’ pain experience, daily least pain (BPI [CONTACT_67307]-4), daily
average pain (BPI [CONTACT_67307]-5) and daily present pain (BPI [CONTACT_67307]-6) after morning ADLs are
also collected. To analyze successful treatment, short-term responders will be
defined as those who have a clinically meaningful 30% reduction of pain [72] at end
of treatment. Long-term responders will be those who continue to have 30%
reduction at weeks 8 and 12. The investigative team has extensive experience with
the BPI. [2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 70, 71, 93, 94]  
Pain interference with ADLs – BPI [CONTACT_67307]-9: BPI [CONTACT_67307]-[ADDRESS_333730] of
pain on ADL performance within 7 domains of daily activity over a 7-day period:
general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people,
sleep and enjoyment of life on a 0-10 NRS, where 0 indicates “does not interfere”
and 10 indicates “completely interferes.” [124] The BPI [CONTACT_67307]-[ADDRESS_333731] been evaluated as part of the BPI

mediated pain reduction on ADLs. [6, 8, 11, 13, 62, 70]  
QoL – SF 36: SF-36 is a health related QoL measure that assesses ph ysical
functioning, role limitation because of physical health problems, bodily pain, social
functioning, general mental health, role limitations because of emotional problems,
vitality (energy/fatigue), and general health perception. [125] It is the only reliable
and valid measure previously used to assess change in QoL associated with the
treatment of shoulder pain with PNS. [6, 9, 13, 71]  
Isometric Voluntary Abduction Shoulder Torque (IVAST): IVAST is an objective
predictor of strength which is an important factor in ability to complete functional
tasks in older adults. [195] IVAST will be measured in an established protocol [96]
with a Biodex Biomechanical Measurement System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley,
NY). Participants will be seated and fastened securely with the abduction axis of the
shoulder aligned with the rotational axis of the dynamometer. The arm will be
attached to the dynamometer by a strap just above the elbow. The arm will be held
at [ADDRESS_333733]
between trials. Abduction torque measurement via Biodex shows high intr a – and
interrater reliability. [97]  
Shoulder Kinematic Analysis: An objective measure of glenohumeral and scapular
range of motion will be obtained using an optical tracking system (Optotrack Certus,
NDI Measurement Science, Ontario, Canada) during the performance of passive and
active pain-free shoulder abduction rotation while seated. Active LED markers will be
mounted on the sternum, scapula, upper arm, and forearm. Digitization of bon y
landmarks on the thorax, scapula, and humerus permit transformation of sensor
data into local segment coordinates according to standard protocol. Custom softw are
will be used to extract angular data from the sensors and calculations will be made
following the recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics,
Shoulder Group. [98] The extracted angular data includes: 1) peak humeral
elevation and 2) Peak scapular tilt. Analysis in post-stroke shoulders is a reliable and
valid measure of impairment. [99, 100]  
Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, upper limb (optional): If PNS reduces HSP by
[CONTACT_273184], then Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA) scores should
improve. The FMA was derived from the Brunnstrom Stages [126] of post-stroke
motor recovery. Each test element will be graded on a 3-point ordinal scale and
summed to provide a maximum upper limb score of 66. Reliability and validity have
been demonstrated. [127-129] The FMA will be administered while the subject was
seated.  
Mechanical Pain Thresholds for Hyperalgesia: The PPTs will be measured with a hand-
held Wagner Instruments FPIX Digital dynamometer (Wagner Instruments,
Greenwich, CT) with 1 sq-cm rubber tip. The PPT is defined as the amount of force
(applied at a rate of 1 kg per second) required to produce a sensation of pain distinct
from pressure or discomfort. The [ADDRESS_333734]
been demonstrated [101-103], and the method has been used to evaluate central
sensitization in numerous pain conditions [104-114], including chronic shoulder pain.

will be the geometric mean of five series of ascending and descending stimuli.

train of 10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_273124] (256mN OR 512mN) repeated at 1/s
rate at the same sites. The use of the larger stimuli will be made if, when presented
at the first test site, the perceived pain rating is “0” for the lesser of the two. Thus, a
greater differentiation of response may be possible, but will not present a significant
discomfort to the subject. In all tests, the subject can stop the testing procedures.

at three different sites: affected shoulder, unaffected shoulder, and unaffected tibialis
anterior (lower leg). The mean pain rating of trains divided by [CONTACT_273185]-up ratio (WUR). [116]  
Several other outcomes measures also will be optional and may not be completed if
the testing is found to take an excessive amount of time or if the subject is, for any
reason, unable or unwilling to complete all of the testing. These include:  
Tactile/touch detection thresholds will be measured using stimulus presentations of
graded TouchTest von Frey monofilaments (North Coast Medical) at each test site.
Using the ascending method of limits, the lowest force monofilament will be
presented to the subject who will respond as to whether or not he/she felt the
stimulus presentation, and increasing forces will be presented until the subject
responds that he/she felt the stimulus. The second series of stimulus presentations
will use the descending method of limits in which a stimulus force that is abo ve
threshold level will be presented and decreasing levels of force will continue to be
presented until the subject indicates that he/she can no longer feel the stimulus. A
second ascending and then a second descending series of stimulus presentations will
occur, so that four estimates of threshold will be obtained at each site.  
Vibration detection thresholds will be measured using the VSA 3000 Vibratory
Sensory Analyzer component of a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc, LTD;
cleared commercially under K922052). The flat probe tip (1.22 sq cm) of the
vibratory device will be held lightly against the skin, and the amplitude of the
(100Hz) vibration will slowly increase until the subject reports that he/she can feel
the vibration. Three trials will be performed at each test site.  
Thermal detection and thermal pain function measures will be performed also using
the TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer. Thermal stimuli will be delivered via a thermal
probe with contact [CONTACT_273186] 2.[ADDRESS_333736] the skin as the temperature increases (for warm detection and hot
pain thresholds) or decreases (for cool detection and cold pain thresholds) from a
baseline temperature that approximately matches the neutral skin surface
temperature (32ºC). Subjects will be instructed to verbally respond when the desired
sensation is reached. (For example, during cool detection threshold trials, subjects
will be instructed that the temperature will slowly change from a neutral
temperature, and that they should tell us as soon as they detect any change in
temperature at the test site. For cold pain threshold trials, subjects will be told that
the temperature will slowly change from a neutral temperature, and that they should
tell us as soon as they feel the sensation increase to a level that they would call
painful.) Each type of sensation threshold (cool detection, warm detection, cold pain,
hot pain) will be measured three times at each test site.  
Temporal Summation of repetitive thermal stimuli will be assessed using the TSA-II
Neurosensory Analyzer in a way comparable to Temporal Summation of repetitive
pin-prick stimuli described earlier. The perceived magnitude of a single thermal
stimulus will be compared with that of a train of 10 thermal stimuli of the same
magnitude repeated at a 1/s rate at the same sites. The mean pain rating of trains
divided by [CONTACT_273187]-up ratio
(WUR).  
Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) is measured using a diffuse noxious inhibitory
control (DNIC) protocol and analyzed through established methods. [121] The “test-
stimulus” is a 7-sec presentation of a thermal noxious stimulus (between 43-49ºC)
to the volar forearm of the nonparetic limb, and the “conditioning stimulus” is the

Other: Five other surveys also are collected once each for either eligibility
determination or potential correlative data analysis. These are the Mini Mental State
Exam (MMSE), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale
(PCS), the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) and a Patient Global
Impression of Change (PGIC) Assessment.  
Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: Participants may not receive additional PT or OT for pain
during the treatment period or during follow-up, but PT or OT for function is
permitted. Similarly, they may not receive any injections, or any other forms of
electrical stimulation, including TENS or surface PNS, to the affected shoulder. Due to
ethical considerations, use of non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_273126]. Participants may adjust dosing of these medications, but it is
preferred that they not change or add medications during the protocol. P articipants
will maintain their dosage during the week prior to each visit to match the recall

practice as well.  
10.[ADDRESS_333752]. How
are they different from those procedures that subjects would normally
undergo?   
Numerous interventions exist for the treatment of shoulder pain following
stroke. This is due to the large number of possible etiologies, the diversity of
clinicians that treat stroke patients, and the lack of consensus regarding a
standard of care. None of the following interventions have been shown to
reduce pain reliably in randomized controlled trials.  
Slings and other supports: Arm slings and other mechanical supports, such
as wheelchair trays, are often used to support the forearm and distribute its
weight to one or both shoulders in an effort to prevent or reduce
subluxation. Although slings may reduce subluxation, they often fail to
reduce shoulder pain as subluxation recurs once they are removed and may
slow rehabilitation by [CONTACT_273190].  
Strappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Strappi[INVESTIGATOR_273130]-stretch tape to the affected
limb to support the glenohumeral joint while allowing free movement of the
arm. In a randomized controlled study of 33 patients, those who received
strappi[INVESTIGATOR_273131] (inactive control group). However, strappi[INVESTIGATOR_273132] a
significant benefit compared to active control groups, who received either
sham strappi[INVESTIGATOR_273133]. In addition,
the tapes must be replaced at least every three days, and skin irritation is
common. 
Local Injection Techniques: Corticosteroid injections address pain by
[CONTACT_273191]. Approximately 50% of clinicians who treat patients
with poststroke shoulder pain believe that steroid injections are effective.
However, there are only two randomized controlled trials of corticosteroid
injections for the treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain and they have
mixed results. A recent trial of subacromial injections reported significant
benefit over placebo. However, an earlier placebo controlled trial of intra-
articular injections showed no benefit. Post-stroke shoulder pain has a
variety of possible etiologies and does not always arise from inflammation,
explaining why steroid injections do not consistently outperform placebo in
stroke patients. In addition to uncertain efficacy, repeat corticosteroid
injections are associated with frequent adverse events, making them a poor
treatment option.  
Botulinum toxin causes local paresis of muscles by [CONTACT_273192]. It has been widely used to treat
spasticity and some data suggest that it may also help to relieve pain. Six of
nine patients in a small uncontrolled study receiving an injection of
botulinum toxin to the affected limb reported pain reduction. However, the
effect of botulinum toxin is known to diminish after 3-[ADDRESS_333753] regarding the repeated use
of botulinum toxin for shoulder pain relief.  
Oral analgesic medications: The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_273134],
including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage
shoulder pain is common practice. Unfortunately, extended use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_273135], skin rash,
dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Though NSAIDs may reduce
shoulder pain in the general population, their efficacy has not been
demonstrated in the stroke population.  
Therapeutic exercises: Therapeutic exercises under the supervision of a
trained professional are generally considered to be an important part of
poststroke rehabilitation. Although they prevent immobility and improve the
range of motion (ROM) of the hemiplegic arm, studies have found that some
exercises, such as the use of an overhead pulley, can cause soft tissue
damage and thereby [CONTACT_273193]. In fact, exercises are generally
associated with a worsening of pain or no change, rather than an
improvement. In a study investigating static positional stretches, the
treatment group showed increasing levels of pain.  
Acupuncture/Electroacupuncture: Acupuncture has been used for centuries
to treat various types of pain and is believed to improve cutaneous andDescribe any therapeutic
alternatives. Can subjects

therapy in which traditional acupuncture needles are used in conjunction
with electrical stimulation, has been evaluated as a therapy for shoulder
pain in post-stroke subjects in a randomized study comparing
electroacupuncture plus occupational/physical therapy to therapy alone.
Although statistically significant improvements in pain reported via a Visual
Analog Scale were observed in the treatment group, the study did not follow
the group beyond the conclusion of the treatment. Thus it is not clear how
often the therapy must be reapplied. In addition, electroacupuncture
requires repeated clinic visits (at least 3 visits per week for 1 month).
Traditional acupuncture has also been evaluated as a treatment for shoulder
pain; however subjects in these studies had non-stroke shoulder pain
etiologies.  
Surface electrical stimulation: Surface electrical stimulation uses skin
surface electrodes applied to the shoulder to deliver stimulation from an
external stimulator. Baker and Parker published the first results from a
randomized controlled trial of surface electrical stimulation for the
treatment of poststroke shoulder pain. The authors found a treatment effect
for subluxation but inconclusive results regarding pain relief. The
investigators of a later study hoped to obtain more conclusive results than
Baker and Parker by [CONTACT_79323] a larger population of [ADDRESS_333754] during
passive motion and during active motion. Subjects were also asked to rate
their pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS). For a subject to be classified
as having no pain, all four variables had to be negative. A significantly
higher proportion of subjects receiving electrical stimulation had no pain at
3, 6, 12, and 24 months compared to the control group (80.7% vs. 55.1%,
p<0.01). The treatment subjects also showed a greater reduction in
subluxation and a significant improvement in the recovery of arm motion.  
The results of four additional studies investigating surface electrical
stimulation are summarized in a Cochrane review. Although the authors
found a significant improvement in pain-free range of motion (ROM) in the
treatment groups, the data did not support a significant reduction in pain
intensity or incidence. The authors concluded that larger randomized
controlled studies would be necessary to fully examine the effects of
electrical stimulation in the post-stroke shoulder pain population.  
Another literature review including six trials found that electrical
stimulation paired with conventional therapy is not superior to conventional
therapy alone for pain prevention. However, they noted that this may be due
to the indirect way in which most studies measured pain (as “pain-free
range of shoulder external rotation”). When pain was measured directly,
using a VAS, electrical stimulation was found to be more effective in
preventing pain than conventional therapy.  
The results regarding the efficacy of surface electrical stimulation as a
treatment for post-stroke shoulder pain have been promising, leading to its
recommendation by [CONTACT_273194]. In addition, a
literature review proposed that surface electrical stimulation combined with
gentle clinician guided exercises should be considered the “best practice”
for acute stroke survivors. However, several authors have noted that even
with further evidence of the efficacy of surface electrical stimulation, it is
unlikely that it will ever be the standard of care due to the discomfort
caused by [CONTACT_273195], the potential for skin
irritation under multiple surface electrodes, the need for skilled personnel to
place the surface electrodes on a daily basis, and muscle fatigue that
commonly occurs due to the high frequency of stimulation. Baker and Parker
noted that either an implantable or a percutaneous system would have to be
developed before electrical stimulation could become the preferred
treatment. For these reasons, researchers have turned their attention to the
use of intramuscular electrical stimulation. 
bion® microstimulator (investigational): Due to the effectiveness of
electrical stimulation but the difficulties associated with surface electrical
stimulation, researchers have begun to investigate direct muscle and nerve
stimulation. The bion® microstimulator used by [CONTACT_273196], Inc. (Valencia, CA),
is currently being investigated for the treatment of post-stroke shoulder
pain and subluxation. Although the bion has technical advantages, including
its small size and self-contained electrode, it also suffers from considerable
disadvantages. First, the device does not utilize a trial stage to evaluate
whether a candidate is likely to experience pain relief from long term use

and precise placement in close proximity to the deep axillary nerve trunk.
Third, the device must be recharged daily using a large, stationary charging
apparatus, to which the patient must be tethered during the recharging
session. In addition, the bion’s extraction requires open surgery. Finally, the
bion requires precise placement due to its bipolar configuration, as the
stimulus current density (and efficiency of nerve recruitment) drops off
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_273136]. Even a small migration of the
bion could significantly diminish its effectiveness. Data regarding the safe
and effective use of the bion for post-stroke shoulder pain have not yet been
published.  10.3 What are the outcome variables and how will they be analyzed? What are
the statistical and analytical methods that will be used?  Note this section

View: 10-01 Risk/Benefits10.1 Assessment of Risk II:
10.[ADDRESS_333756] and quantitate the risks involved for each experimental procedure in
bullet form. Identify risks as common (greater than 10%) uncommon
(greater than 1% up to and including 10 %) rare (1% or less). This must
match the risks listed in the Consent Form:  
1) Risks associated with needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead placementThere are minor risks associated with inserting a Lead through the skin
with a needle. These risks are similar to the risks of any needle injection
including the possibilities of puncturing a blood vessel, irritating a nerve,
and temporary bruising or pain at the insertion site. The risks of
puncturing a blood vessel and irritating a nerve are uncommon, but the
risks of temporary bruising and pain at the insertion site are common.  
Some participants may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due
to the discomfort or anxiety associated with of the procedure, especially
among those with prior history of “fainting.” This risk is rare and may be
associated with symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and or diaphoresis
with concomitant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. For those
with prior history of “fainting” the procedure will be performed with the
subject in the lateral decubitus position.  
To minimize the risks associated with percutaneously placing fine wire
leads, only appropriately trained physician investigators will perform the
procedure. In addition, the risk of excessive bleeding will be reduced by
[CONTACT_273197] > 3.0 and by
[CONTACT_273198]. Finally, the risk of discomfort during the procedure will be
reduced by [CONTACT_273199]. 
It is possible that, in some cases, multiple attempts may be required to
achieve appropriate placement of the Lead during the procedure. Each
additional attempt at Lead placement carries the same risks as the initial
attempt described in this section.  
2) Risk of skin irritation, infection, or inflammation at the Sprint MicroLead
exit siteThere are risks of leaving a Sprint MicroLead in place for 4 weeks,
including skin irritation, infection, and granuloma formation (mild tissue
inflammation) at the Lead exit site. Symptoms include redness, swelling, or
pain. The risk of skin irritation is common while the risks of infection and
granuloma formation are rare.  
These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_273200].

insertion. The insertion site will be covered with a dressing to keep it clean  
and dry, and the subjects and their caregivers will be instructed to inspect  
the site for signs of infection or irritation regularly and to inform the  
Investigator if they occur. If infection or skin irritation occurs, the  
Investigator will administer an antibiotic and/or remove the Lead.  
Infections are rare and typi[INVESTIGATOR_273138]. 
It should be noted that in a completed clinical trial of percutaneous  
intramuscular electrical stimulation, one patient death occurred. The 
subject did not follow the instructions for the care of the Lead exit site and  
also did not return for his scheduled follow-up visit following electrode  
placement. He developed an electrode related infection and was  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The cause of death is thought to be a myocardial infarction or  
a pulmonary embolus, but the exact cause of the death and its relationship 
to the infection are not known. To mitigate the potential risk of serious  
infection, a 48-72 hour safety check will be performed after the procedure.  
Participants will return to the clinic and the exit site will be evaluated for  
signs of infection. 
3) Risk of the Sprint MicroLead breaking beneath the skin
There is a possibility of a Lead breaking beneath the skin either during the 
course of the study or during the procedure to remove Lead. This risk is 
uncommon. However, when a Lead breaks, one or more Lead fragments  
usually remain in the body. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to  
determine if the removal of such fragments is necessary. Visual inspection  
of the Lead after it has been removed as well as x-rays will be used to  
determine if any Lead fragments remain. The risk associated with the x-
rays is no greater than that associated with conventional clinical x-rays. If  
the Investigator determines a Lead fragment has been retained in the  
body, he/she will determine what is medically required to further evaluate  
and treat this retained fragment. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], no treatment is required unless 
there are further sequelae, such as an infection or granuloma, associated  
with the fragment. 
The risk of leaving a Lead fragment is minimized by [CONTACT_273201]. In  
this protocol, a single Sprint MicroLead will be implanted for just 4 weeks.  
4) Risk of infection associated with retained Sprint MicroLead fragments
A Lead fragment could result in the formation of a granuloma or infection. 
Although the occurrence of a fragment-related infection or granuloma is  
uncommon an infection may require removal of the Lead fragment and/or  
treatment with antibiotics. Investigators at the Cleveland FES Center and  
Case Western Reserve University have over [ADDRESS_333757] been developed as well as the extensive experience of the 
Investigators.. 
5) Risks associated with lead fragment removal
It is possible that a Lead fragment or fragments may be retained in the  
body following removal of the Sprint MicroLead. If the Investigator  
determines that a lead fragment has been retained, the Investigator will 
instruct the subject and his/her caregiver to carefully inspect the Sprint  
MicroLead exit site and the surrounding skin in the weeks subsequent to  
Lead removal. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273202], redness, swelling, discharge, or the  
appearance of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45886]-like mass (skin abscess). Such signs indicate that  
the fragment has migrated to the skin surface. At that time, if clinically 
warranted, the fragment may be removed via an outpatient procedure 
which involves lancing the abscess and removing the fragment and  
application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_11978]. 
The risks associated with the Lead fragment removal procedure include  
discomfort during the procedure and skin irritation or infection in the area  
of the retained fragment. These risks are rare. The risk of infection is

monitor the site and immediately report any signs of infection.  
6) Risk of Lead Replacement due to Lead Migration or Lead Becoming
Dislodged
It is possible that the Lead may migrate from its original intended location
or that the Lead may become dislodged (i.e. come out completely) during
the treatment phase. This risk is rare. If lead migration occurs, it is
possible that the subject may experience discomfort during stimulation
(described further below under “risk of discomfort with electrical
stimulation”). If the Lead has migrated substantially or has come out, it
may be necessary to place another Lead. Each time an additional lead is
placed, the subject has an additional exposure to the same risks of lead
placement described above in “risk of needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead
placement”. 
This risk of lead migration or the becoming dislodged is mitigated by
[CONTACT_273204], as appropriate, to ensure
careful handling of the Lead and Lead Connector during bandage changes.
In addition, the risk of placing a new lead is further mitigated by [CONTACT_273205], ensuring
that the shoulder tissue appears healthy prior to placing a new lead, and
collecting an additional INR blood sample for subjects who are taking
warfarin.  
7) Risk of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad or bandagesIt is possible that the skin could become irritated under the Sprint Pad.
Additionally, there may be skin irritation in the area surrounding the Lead
insertion site, where an adhesive bandage is taped to the skin. This risk is
common; however, the bandages can be changed to prevent the irritation
from returning.  
The risks of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad (a modified surface
electrode) and under the bandages surrounding the Sprint MicroLead exit
site will be reduced by [CONTACT_273206]/or medical-grade adhesive tapes. Subjects and
their caregivers will be advised to examine the electrode exit site at
regular intervals to look for any signs of irritation. To avoid irritation under
the Sprint Pad, subjects will be advised that the Sprint Stimulator and
Sprint Pad may be moved to slightly different locations near the Lead
insertion site throughout the treatment phase. In addition, subjects will be
instructed to avoid placing the Sprint Pad or bandages on unhealthy skin. 
8) Risk of mechanical or electrical failure of the Sprint StimulatorThere is a rare chance that the Sprint Stimulator may malfunction. It is
very unlikely that a stimulator malfunction will be harmful. If there is a
problem with the Sprint Stimulator or the Sprint MicroLead, the Stimulator
will reset itself such that no stimulation is delivered.  
The Sprint Stimulator will not deliver stimulation if it detects a high
impedance level indicating a broken lead wire or a faulty lead connection.
Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273207].  
9) Risks for pregnant women
The risk of harm to a pregnant woman or fetus is unknown. The device will
not be used in any subjects known to be pregnant. If a subject is known to
become pregnant during the treatment phase, stimulation will be stopped
and the Sprint MicroLead will be removed. 
Potential risks of pregnancy will be reduced by [CONTACT_17801] a pregnancy
test in females of reproductive potential at study enrollment. Additionally,
the Informed Consent form will advise subjects that the risks of electrical
stimulation during pregnancy are unknown and that they should
immediately notify the Investigator if they suspect they have become
pregnant during the study.  
10) Risk of discomfort due to electrical stimulation
ID: IRB16-[ZIP_CODE]
Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for Shoulder Pain: Dose Response. Document Date: 12/18/2020
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 25/71Intramuscular electrical stimulation may be perceived by [CONTACT_2180] a
tingling or vibrating sensation, which may feel uncomfortable or painful.
The risk of discomfort due to stimulation is uncommon. At high stimulation
intensities, shoulder pain may worsen.  
To minimize the risk of increased shoulder pain as the result of high
intensity stimulation, the Investigator will set an appropriate intensity for
the stimulation. Should a subject feel pain as the result of stimulation, he
or she will be able to turn off the stimulation using the Sprint Stimulator
controls. Although muscle fatigue is unlikely with six hours of daily
stimulation therapy, subjects may also feel some discomfort if muscle
fatigue occurs. If muscle fatigue is observed, the Investigator is able to
prescribe several shorter stimulation sessions totaling six hours per day.  
Discomfort or pain due to stimulation may occur if the Sprint MicroLead
migrates from its original location. Stimulation near the skin surface may
be perceived as a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” or stinging sensation and may be
uncomfortable. 
The risk of pain due to a migrating electrode will be minimized by [CONTACT_273208]. The
Sprint MicroLead has a fine wire barb. In addition, the proximal portion of
the Lead exits the skin which makes this Lead more susceptible to
becoming dislodged during bandage changes. As a conservative measure,
we allow one week for encapsulation of the Sprint MicroLead to ensure
stability. Data on the Lead has shown that electrodes are fully
encapsulated by [CONTACT_273209].  
A tingling sensation may be felt under the Sprint Pad but this sensation is
not expected to be uncomfortable. If discomfort or pain is felt at the Sprint
Pad site, the subject will be instructed to turn off stimulation and move the
Sprint Pad and Stimulator to a different location.  
11) Risks associated with DiathermyThere is a risk of tissue damage if a subject undergoes diathermy.
Shortwave or microwave diathermy is a therapy that may be used to apply
deep therapeutic heat for the treatment of selected medical conditions
such as relief of pain, muscle spasms, and joint contractures. Diathermy
can cause excessive heating of any implanted metal part (including Leads),
resulting in serious injury. The risk of tissue damage associated with
diathermy is rare.  
The risk of diathermy will be reduced by [CONTACT_273210]. In addition, subjects will be informed to never undergo
diathermy if a Sprint MicroLead fragment remains in the body. 
12) Risks associated with MRITissue damage may occur if a subject undergoes an MRI procedure while
the Sprint MicroLead, or a fragment of the Sprint MicroLead, is in the body.
The risk of tissue damage associated with MRI use is rare.  
Should a subject require a scheduled MRI during the treatment phase, the
Sprint MicroLead will be removed. The decision to remove any remaining
fragments will depend on a careful assessment of the benefits of the MRI,
risks of MRI with retained fragments and risks associated with removing of
electrode fragments. 
13) Risk of allergic reaction to local anesthetics and/or risk of accidental
injection of local anesthetic into a veinThere is a risk that the subject may have an allergic reaction to the local
anesthetic used during the treatment phase prior to insertion of the Sprint
MicroLead. If the subject were to have an allergic reaction, it would usually
happen while the subject was still in the clinic. If a subject complains of
itching, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness and dizziness, or a swollen
tongue (common signs of an allergic reaction), appropriate medical
treatment will be administered. The risk of allergic reaction to local
anesthetics is rare. In addition, there is a risk of adverse central nervous
system and/or cardiovascular effects (including a rare risk that the

local anesthetic is administered improperly. 
The risks of allergy to local anesthetic agents will be reduced by [CONTACT_273211] a prior known history of allergy or sensitivity to local
anesthetic agents. In addition, prior to the procedure, subjects will be
advised of the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction. Because
subjects will be awake during this procedure, they will be able to verbalize
any itching or other signs of allergy to the local anesthetic. The risks of
accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic will be reduced by
[CONTACT_273212]. Careful administration
includes ensuring that a vein has not been punctured by [CONTACT_273213]. In
addition, the physical location of the anesthetic injection (in the deltoid)
combined with the injection technique would rarely result in an accidental
intravascular injection.  
14) Risk associated with venipuncture (if applicable)The risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of
puncture, possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site, an
infection, and faintness from the procedure. The risks of discomfort,
bruising, and swelling around the puncture site are common while the risks
of infection and fainting are rare. Blood sample collections are only
required in subjects taking warfarin.  
Subjects taking warfarin are at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_273139]. However, the risk of discomfort and bruising at
that puncture site will be reduced by [CONTACT_273214].
The rare risk of infection due to venipuncture will be reduced by [CONTACT_273215][INVESTIGATOR_273140]. 
Some subjects may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to
the discomfort of needle insertion or anxiety associated with the
procedure. The risk of fainting will be reduced by [CONTACT_273216]. Subjects with a history of vasovagal
responses will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_273141].  
15) Risk of worsening of pain symptomsIt is possible that the subject may have a worsening of pain symptoms or
that they may not obtain any therapeutic benefit from the treatment. The
risk of worsening pain symptoms is uncommon. In addition, subjects will
have the opportunity to discontinue treatment if their stimulation is too
uncomfortable. 
These risks are mitigated by [CONTACT_273217]. Subjects do
not have access to make changes to the programming controls and thus
could not advertently change the value. 
16) Risks of Outcomes AssessmentsThe questionnaires and Fugl-Meyer Assessment present no risks. The
assessments of shoulder torque and kinematics may be slightly
uncomfortable. The measures of central sensitization (mechanical pain
thresholds for hyperalgesia, pi[INVESTIGATOR_273115],
temporal summation of repetitive pin-prick stimuli) may be slightly
uncomfortable and may cause brief skin irritation. The optional measures
(tactile/touch, vibration and thermal/thermal pain detection thresholds,
temporal summation of repetitive thermal stimuli, and Conditioned Pain
Modulation (CPM)) also may be uncomfortable and may cause brief skin
irritation.  
17) OtherSome of the survey questions present a rare risk of psychological harm. 
When PHI is involved there is the rare risk of a privacy breach.

exposure of study subjects to these risks: 
1) Risks associated with needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead placement
To minimize the risks associated with percutaneously placing fine wire leads, only
appropriately trained ph
ysician investigators will perform the procedure. In addition,
the risk of excessive bleeding will be reduced by [CONTACT_273218] > 3.0 and by [CONTACT_273219]. Finally, the risk of discomfort during
the procedure will be reduced by [CONTACT_273220].  
Some participants may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to the
discomfort or anxiety associated with of the procedure, especially among those with
prior history of “fainting.” This risk is rare and may be associated with symptoms of
lightheadedness, dizziness and or diaphoresis with concomitant reduction in blood
pressure and heart rate. For those with prior history of “fainting” the procedure will
be performed with the subject in the lateral decubitus position.  
2) Risk of skin irritation, infection, or inflammation at the Sprint MicroLead exit site
These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_273221]. The insertion site
will be covered with a dressing to keep it clean and dry, and the subjects and their
caregivers will be instructed to inspect the site for signs of infection or irritation
regularly and to inform the Investigator if they occur. If infection or skin irritation
occurs, the Investigator will administer an antibiotic and/or remove the Lead.

electrical stimulation, one patient death occurred. The subject did not follow the
instructions for the care of the Lead exit site and also did not return for his
scheduled follow-up visit following electrode placement. He developed an electrode
related infection and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The cause of death is thought to be a
myocardial infarction or a pulmonary embolus, but the exact cause of the death and
its relationship to the infection are not known. To mitigate the potential risk of
serious infection, a 48-72 hour safety check will be performed after the procedure.
Participants will return to the clinic and the exit site will be evaluated for signs of
infection.  
3) Risk of the Sprint MicroLead breaking beneath the skinThe risk of leaving a Lead fragment is minimized b
y reducing the amount of time
the Lead remains implanted and the number of Leads implanted. In this protocol, a
single Sprint MicroLead will be implanted for just 4 weeks.  
4) Risk of infection associated with retained Sprint MicroLead fragments
Investigators at the Cleveland FES Center and Case W
estern Reserve University
have over [ADDRESS_333759] been developed as well as the extensive experience of the
Investigators.  
5) Risks associated with lead fragment removalSubjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273222],
redness, swelling, discharge, or the appear
ance of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45886]-like mass (skin
abscess). Such signs indicate that the fragment has migrated to the skin surface. At
that time, if clinically warranted, the fragment may be removed via an outpatient
procedure which involves lancing the abscess and removing the fragment and
application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_11978].  
6) Risk of Lead Replacement due to Lead Migration or Lead Becoming DislodgedIt is possible that the Lead may migrate from its original intended location or that
the Lead may become dislodged (i.e. come out completely) during the treatment
phase. Each time an additional lead is placed, the subject has an additional
exposure to the same risks of lead placement described abo
ve in “risk of needle
insertion for Sprint Micro Lead placement”.  
This risk of lead migration or the becoming dislodged is mitigated by [CONTACT_273223], as appropriate, to ensure careful handling of the
Lead and Lead Connector during bandage changes. In addition, the risk of placing a
new lead is further mitigated by [CONTACT_273224], ensuring that the shoulder tissue appears health y prior to
placing a new lead, and collecting an additional INR blood sample for subjects who
are taking warfarin.  
7) Risk of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad or bandagesThe risks of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad (a modified surface electrode) and
under the bandages surrounding the Sprint MicroLead exit site will be reduced b y
excluding patients with known sensitivity to skin surface electrodes and/or medical-
gr
ade adhesive tapes. Subjects and their caregivers will be advised to examine the
electrode exit site at regular intervals to look for any signs of irritation. To avoid
irritation under the Sprint Pad, subjects will be advised that the Sprint Stimulator
and Sprint Pad may be moved to slightly different locations near the Lead insertion
site throughout the treatment phase. In addition, subjects will be instructed to
avoid placing the Sprint Pad or bandages on unhealthy skin.  
8) Risk of mechanical or electrical failure of the Sprint StimulatorThere is a rare chance that the Sprint Stimulator may malfunction. It is very
unlik
ely that a stimulator malfunction will be harmful. If there is a problem with the
Sprint Stimulator or the Sprint MicroLead, the Stimulator will reset itself such that
no stimulation is delivered.  
The Sprint Stimulator will not deliver stimulation if it detects a high impedance level

to contact [CONTACT_273225].  
9) Risks for pregnant women
The risk of harm to a pregnant woman or fetus is unknown. The device will not be
used in any subjects known to be pregnant. If a subject is known to become
pregnant during the treatment phase, stimulation will be stopped and the Sprint
MicroLead will be removed.  
P
otential risks of pregnancy will be reduced by [CONTACT_17801] a pregnancy test in
females of reproductive potential at study enrollment. Additionally, the Informed
Consent form will advise subjects that the risks of electrical stimulation during
pregnancy are unknown and that they should immediately notify the Investigator if
they suspect they have become pregnant during the study. 
10) Risk of discomfort due to electrical stimulationTo minimize the risk of increased shoulder pain as the result of high intensity
stimulation, the Inv
estigator will set an appropriate intensity for the stimulation.
Should a subject feel pain as the result of stimulation, he or she will be able to turn
off the stimulation using the Sprint Stimulator controls. Although muscle fatigue is
unlikely with six hours of daily stimulation therapy, subjects may also feel some
discomfort if muscle fatigue occurs. If muscle fatigue is observ ed, the Investigator
is able to prescribe several shorter stimulation sessions totaling six hours per day. 
Discomfort or pain due to stimulation may occur if the Sprint MicroLead migrates
from its original location. Stimulation near the skin surface ma y be perceived as a
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” or stinging sensation and may be uncomfortable.  
The risk of pain due to a migrating electrode will be minimized by [CONTACT_273226] e. The Sprint
MicroLead has a fine wire barb. In addition, the proximal portion of the Lead exits
the skin which makes this Lead more susceptible to becoming dislodged during
bandage changes. As a conservative measure, we allow one week for encapsulation
of the Sprint MicroLead to ensure stability. Data on the Lead has shown that
electrodes are fully encapsulated by [CONTACT_273209].  
A tingling sensation may be felt under the Sprint Pad but this sensation is not
expected to be uncomfortable. If discomfort or pain is felt at the Sprint P ad site, the
subject will be instructed to turn off stimulation and move the Sprint Pad and
Stimulator to a different location.  
11) Risks associated with DiathermyThe risk of diathermy will be reduced by [CONTACT_273227]. In addition, subjects will be informed to nev
er undergo diathermy if a
Sprint MicroLead fragment remains in the body.  
12) Risks associated with MRI
Should a subject require a scheduled MRI during the treatment phase, the Sprint
MicroLead will be removed. The decision to remov
e any remaining fragments will
depend on a careful assessment of the benefits of the MRI, risks of MRI with
retained fragments and risks associated with removing of electrode fragments.
13) Risk of allergic reaction to local anesthetics and/or risk of accidental injection of
local anesthetic into a vein
The risks of allergy to local anesthetic agents will be reduced b y excluding subjects
with a prior known history of allergy or sensitivity to local anesthetic agents. In
addition, prior to the procedure, subjects will be advised of the signs and symptoms
of an allergic reaction. Because subjects will be aw
ake during this procedure, they
will be able to verbalize any itching or other signs of allergy to the local anesthetic.
The risks of accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic will be reduced by
[CONTACT_273212]. Careful administration includes
ensuring that a vein has not been punctured by [CONTACT_273228]. In addition, the ph ysical
location of the anesthetic injection (in the deltoid) combined with the injection
technique would rarely result in an accidental intravascular injection.  
14) Risk associated with venipuncture (if applicable)

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 30/71Subjects taking warfarin are at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_273144]. However, the risk of discomfort and bruising at that puncture site will
be reduced by [CONTACT_273229]. The rare risk of infection due to
venipuncture will be reduced by [CONTACT_273230][INVESTIGATOR_273145].  
Some subjects may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to the
discomfort of needle insertion or anxiety associated with the procedure. The risk of
fainting will be reduced by [CONTACT_273231]. Subjects with a
history of vasovagal responses will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_273141].  
15) Risk of worsening of pain symptomsIt is possible that the subject may have a worsening of pain symptoms or that they
ma
y not obtain any therapeutic benefit from the treatment. The risk of worsening
pain symptoms is uncommon. In addition, subjects will have the opportunity to
discontinue treatment if their stimulation is too uncomfortable.  
These risks are mitigated by [CONTACT_273217]. Subjects do not
have access to make changes to the programming controls and thus could not
advertently change the value.  
16) Risks of Outcomes Assessments
If the subject feels discomfort, they may request that the outcomes assessments be
paused. Measures will be taken to improv
e their comfort if possible. Skin irritation,
should it occur, should resolved shortly after the cause is removed.  
17) Other
Subjects may choose not to answer survey questions that make them
uncomfortable.  
Priv
acy breach precautions are included in Sections 15-17.  
There may be other risks as yet unknown.

View: 16-[ADDRESS_333774] For a Partial Wavier of HIPAA Authorization
An IRB, under certain circumstances, may allow researchers to forgo obtaining an authorization; this is called a w
aiver of authorization. A waiver
of authorization may be full or partial:
full waiver: an IRB waives the requirement for authorization for all uses of PHI for a particular research protocol (see Section 16.[ADDRESS_333775] for a Waiver of HIPAA Authorization);
partial waiver: an IRB waives the requirement for an authorization only for some uses of PHI for a particular research protocol.
Researchers are required to obtain subjects' Research Authorizations after recruiting and enrolling subjects via a partial waiver and prior to
creating or using PHI during research procedures .
Partial Waiver for Preparatory for Research Activities:
According to HHS guidance on the Privacy Rule the preparatory to research provision permits covered entities to use or disclose protected
health information for purposes preparatory to research, such as to aid study recruitment. However, the provision at 45 CFR
164.512(i)(1)(ii) does not permit  the researcher to remove protected health information from the covered entity's site.  As
such, a researcher who is an employee or a member of the covered entity's workforce could use protected health information to
contact [CONTACT_273243]. The preparatory research provision would allow such a researcher to identify prospective
research participants for purposes of seeking their Authorization to use or disclose protected health information for a research study.
Under the preparatory to research provision, a covered entity may permit a researcher who works for that covered entity to use PHI
for purposes preparatory to research. A covered entity may also permit, as a disclosure of PHI, a researcher who is not a workforce
member of that covered entity to review PHI (within that covered entity) for purposes preparatory to research.

16.4
The IRB as part of it's review of this request must have certain reassurances that
P
atient Privacy will be protected, please respond to the following questions true or
false.
1.) The PHI will be used solely to facilitate the research protocol as an aid to study
recruitment or to expand the research study. The waiver would allow identification of
prospective research participants for the purpose of seeking authorization to use or
disclose PHI for a research study. Essentially, PHI will be used to identify and contact
[CONTACT_273244]. Only contact [CONTACT_273245] (r ace, age,
medications, diagnosis, and primary physician) will be recorded, and no information
will leave the premises of MetroHealth Medical Center. The information will not be
disclosed outside the research group for this study.  True False
2.) Information about potential subjects who are not interested in participating will be
destroyed after the patient declines enrollment. The information of patients choosing
to participate will be further used to schedule an appointment. As soon as the
research staff sees the participant, a full authorization will be obtained to collect, use
and disclose PHI for the remainder of the study.  True False
3.) The PHI will not be reused or disclosed. Because the PHI belongs to individuals
who are not yet in the study, oversight provisions do not apply. After subjects are
formally enrolled, an authorization will be in effect and the waiver will no longer
apply.  True FalseCheck true or false.  
16.5 If you did not answer true to all three parts of question 16.4 please explain:  Please explain your response to
any statement where you have
entered false.
16.6 Please give a detailed explanation as to why this research activity cannot be
pr
acticably conducted without a Partial Waiver or without access to PHI:  
While most candidates for the study are expected to be identifed via direct referr al
from the investigators and their department colleagues, or via means whereby [CONTACT_273246], some prospective candidates for the study could be
identified via review of the electronic medical record system.  
Candidates who agree to an Eligibility visit will be asked to sign a Consent and HIPAA

View: 18-[ADDRESS_333787] TO COMPLETE A DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN? 
FOR THE IRB-  All interven onal studies that are greater than minimal risk should have a Data Safety Monitoring Plan. The IRB reserves the right
to require a Data Safety Monitoring Plan for any study.
Archived IRB Da
ta Plans - prior to 9/28/2010
FOR THE CRU-   ALL CRU PROTOCOLS  [Recent NIH guidelines stipulate that all protocols that involve human
subjects, a signed consent form and are conducted on, or use the resources of, the CTSA Clinical Research
Unit - MHMC (CRU) are required to have a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSM Plan).]  
What is a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSM Plan)?
A DSM Plan 
is a prospectively defined strategy to assess the assumptions made in the trial design while the study is in progress.  Its main
purpose is to ensure the safety of participants in clinical research studies and the validity and integrity of research data collection. A properlyThere is a significant amount of patient documentation (consent forms, manuals,  
questionnaires) that would require translation. Also, the research, and the necessary interaction  
with the study team, requires understanding of English.

The DSM Plan needs to address the nature of the safety monitoring and who will be conducting that monitoring.   It may be reasonable for a single
individual to perform the monitoring in a small trial with mini
mal/low risk while a local independent or an external data and safety monitoring
board (DSMB) may be required for more complex/high risk trials.
Key elements to be incorporated in a DSM Plan
· Assessment of risks and monitoring level
· Safety contact: [CONTACT_273253]?
· Safety monitoring: Who will do it? How often?
· Informed consent process; consistency with the protocol
· Data collection process
· Adverse Events Monitoring: Anticipated and unanticipated
· Description of anticipated adverse events

3.B.1 Description of anticipated adverse events. Pulled from question 10.5.
1) Risks associated with needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead placement
There are minor risks associated with inserting a Lead through the skin with a needle.
These risks are similar to the risks of any needle injection including the possibilities of
puncturing a blood vessel, irritating a nerve, and temporary bruising or pain at the
insertion site. The risks of puncturing a blood vessel and irritating a nerve are
uncommon, but the risks of temporary bruising and pain at the insertion site are
common.  
Some participants may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to the
discomfort or anxiety associated with of the procedure, especially among those with prior
history of “fainting.” This risk is rare and may be associated with symptoms of
lightheadedness, dizziness and or diaphoresis with concomitant reduction in blood
pressure and heart rate. For those with prior history of “fainting” the procedure will be
performed with the subject in the lateral decubitus position.  
To minimize the risks associated with percutaneously placing fine wire leads, only
appropriately trained physician investigators will perform the procedure. In addition, the
risk of excessive bleeding will be reduced by [CONTACT_273257] > 3.0 and by [CONTACT_273258]. Finally, the risk of discomfort during the procedure will be
reduced by [CONTACT_273199].  
It is possible that, in some cases, multiple attempts may be required to achieve
appropriate placement of the Lead during the procedure. Each additional attempt at Lead
placement carries the same risks as the initial attempt described in this section.  
2) Risk of skin irritation, infection, or inflammation at the Sprint MicroLead exit site
There are risks of leaving a Sprint MicroLead in place for 4 weeks, including skin
irritation, infection, and granuloma formation (mild tissue inflammation) at the Lead exit
site. Symptoms include redness, swelling, or pain. The risk of skin irritation is common
while the risks of infection and granuloma formation are r are. 
These risks will be minimiz
ed by [CONTACT_273221]. The insertion site will be
covered with a dressing to keep it clean and dry, and the subjects and their caregivers
will be instructed to inspect the site for signs of infection or irritation regularly and to
inform the Investigator if they occur. If infection or skin irritation occurs, the Investigator
will administer an antibiotic and/or remove the Lead. Infections are rare and typi[INVESTIGATOR_273159].  
It should be noted that in a completed clinical trial of percutaneous intr amuscular
electrical stimulation, one patient death occurred. The subject did not follow the
instructions for the care of the Lead exit site and also did not return for his scheduled
follow-up visit following electrode placement. He developed an electrode related infection
and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The cause of death is thought to be a myocardial infarction or a
pulmonary embolus, but the exact cause of the death and its relationship to the infection
are not known. To mitigate the potential risk of serious infection, a 48-72 hour safety
check will be performed after the procedure. Participants will return to the clinic and the
exit site will be evaluated for signs of infection.  
3) Risk of the Sprint MicroLead breaking beneath the skinThere is a possibility of a Lead breaking beneath the skin either during the course of the
study or during the procedure to remove Lead. This risk is uncommon. However, when a
Lead breaks, one or more Lead fragments usually remain in the body. The Investigator
will use clinical judgment to determine if the removal of such fragments is necessary.
Visual inspection of the Lead after it has been removed as well as x-rays will be used to
determine if any Lead fragments remain. The risk associated with the x-rays is no greater
than that associated with conventional clinical x-rays. If the Investigator determines a
Lead fragment has been retained in the body, he/she will determine what is medically
required to further evaluate and treat this retained fragment. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], no treatment is
required unless there are further sequelae, such as an infection or gr anuloma, associated
with the fragment.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 50/71The risk of leaving a Lead fragment is minimized by [CONTACT_273259]. In this protocol, a single
Sprint MicroLead will be implanted for just 4 weeks.  
4) Risk of infection associated with retained Sprint MicroLead fragments
A Lead fragment could result in the formation of a granuloma or infection. Although the
occurrence of a fragment-related infection or granuloma is uncommon an infection may
require removal of the Lead fragment and/or treatment with antibiotics. Investigators at
the Cleveland FES Center and Case Western Reserve University have over [ADDRESS_333789] been
uncommon, which is attributed to the materials and procedures that ha ve been
developed as well as the extensive experience of the Investigators..  
5) Risks associated with lead fragment removalIt is possible that a Lead fragment or fragments may be retained in the body following
removal of the Sprint MicroLead. If the Investigator determines that a lead fragment has
been retained, the Investigator will instruct the subject and his/her caregiver to carefully
inspect the Sprint MicroLead exit site and the surrounding skin in the weeks subsequent
to Lead removal. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273260], redness, swelling, discharge, or the appearance of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45886]-like mass (skin
abscess). Such signs indicate that the fragment has migrated to the skin surface. At that
time, if clinically warranted, the fragment may be removed via an outpatient procedure
which involves lancing the abscess and removing the fragment and application of a
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11978]. 
The risks associated with the Lead fragment removal procedure include discomfort during
the procedure and skin irritation or infection in the area of the retained fr agment. These
risks are rare. The risk of infection is mitigated by [CONTACT_273203]/or his
caregiver to carefully monitor the site and immediately report any signs of infection.  
6) Risk of Lead Replacement due to Lead Migration or Lead Becoming DislodgedIt is possible that the Lead may migrate from its original intended location or that the
Lead may become dislodged (i.e. come out completely) during the treatment phase. This
risk is rare. If lead migration occurs, it is possible that the subject may experience
discomfort during stimulation (described further below under “risk of discomfort with
electrical stimulation”). If the Lead has migrated substantially or has come out, it may be
necessary to place another Lead. Each time an additional lead is placed, the subject has
an additional exposure to the same risks of lead placement described abo ve in “risk of
needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead placement”.  
This risk of lead migration or the becoming dislodged is mitigated by [CONTACT_273261], as appropriate, to ensure careful handling of the Lead and
Lead Connector during bandage changes. In addition, the risk of placing a new lead is
further mitigated by [CONTACT_273262], ensuring that the shoulder tissue appears healthy prior to placing a new lead,
and collecting an additional INR blood sample for subjects who are taking w arfarin.  
7) Risk of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad or bandagesIt is possible that the skin could become irritated under the Sprint P ad. Additionally, there
may be skin irritation in the area surrounding the Lead insertion site, where an adhesive
bandage is taped to the skin. This risk is common; however, the bandages can be
changed to prevent the irritation from returning.  
The risks of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad (a modified surface electrode) and under
the bandages surrounding the Sprint MicroLead exit site will be reduced b y excluding
patients with known sensitivity to skin surface electrodes and/or medical-grade adhesive
tapes. Subjects and their caregivers will be advised to examine the electrode exit site at
regular intervals to look for any signs of irritation. To avoid irritation under the Sprint
Pad, subjects will be advised that the Sprint Stimulator and Sprint Pad may be moved to
slightly different locations near the Lead insertion site throughout the treatment phase.
In addition, subjects will be instructed to avoid placing the Sprint Pad or bandages on
unhealthy skin.  
8) Risk of mechanical or electrical failure of the Sprint StimulatorThere is a rare chance that the Sprint Stimulator may malfunction. It is very unlikely that

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 51/71a stimulator malfunction will be harmful. If there is a problem with the Sprint Stimulator
or the Sprint MicroLead, the Stimulator will reset itself such that no stimulation is
delivered.  
The Sprint Stimulator will not deliver stimulation if it detects a high impedance level
indicating a broken lead wire or a faulty lead connection. Subjects will be instructed to
contact [CONTACT_273225].  
9) Risks for pregnant womenThe risk of harm to a pregnant woman or fetus is unknown. The device will not be used in
any subjects known to be pregnant. If a subject is known to become pregnant during the
treatment phase, stimulation will be stopped and the Sprint MicroLead will be remo ved. 
Potential risks of pregnancy will be reduced by [CONTACT_17801] a pregnancy test in females
of reproductive potential at study enrollment. Additionally, the Informed Consent form
will advise subjects that the risks of electrical stimulation during pregnancy are unknown
and that they should immediately notify the Investigator if they suspect they have
become pregnant during the study.  
10) Risk of discomfort due to electrical stimulationIntramuscular electrical stimulation may be perceived by [CONTACT_2180] a tingling or
vibrating sensation, which may feel uncomfortable or painful. The risk of discomfort due
to stimulation is uncommon. At high stimulation intensities, shoulder pain may worsen.  
To minimize the risk of increased shoulder pain as the result of high intensity stimulation,
the Investigator will set an appropriate intensity for the stimulation. Should a subject feel
pain as the result of stimulation, he or she will be able to turn off the stimulation using
the Sprint Stimulator controls. Although muscle fatigue is unlik ely with six hours of daily
stimulation therapy, subjects may also feel some discomfort if muscle fatigue occurs. If
muscle fatigue is observed, the Investigator is able to prescribe several shorter
stimulation sessions totaling six hours per day. 
Discomfort or pain due to stimulation may occur if the Sprint MicroLead migrates from its
original location. Stimulation near the skin surface may be perceived as a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_273160]” or stinging sensation and may be uncomfortable.  
The risk of pain due to a migrating electrode will be minimized by [CONTACT_273263]. The Sprint MicroLead has a fine wire
barb. In addition, the proximal portion of the Lead exits the skin which makes this Lead
more susceptible to becoming dislodged during bandage changes. As a conserv ative
measure, we allow one week for encapsulation of the Sprint MicroLead to ensure stabilit y.
Data on the Lead has shown that electrodes are fully encapsulated b y the surrounding
tissue.  
A tingling sensation may be felt under the Sprint Pad but this sensation is not expected to
be uncomfortable. If discomfort or pain is felt at the Sprint Pad site, the subject will be
instructed to turn off stimulation and move the Sprint Pad and Stimulator to a different
location. 
11) Risks associated with DiathermyThere is a risk of tissue damage if a subject undergoes diatherm y. Shortwave or
microwave diathermy is a therapy that may be used to apply deep therapeutic heat for
the treatment of selected medical conditions such as relief of pain, muscle spasms, and
joint contractures. Diathermy can cause excessive heating of any implanted metal part
(including Leads), resulting in serious injury. The risk of tissue damage associated with
diathermy is rare.  
The risk of diathermy will be reduced by [CONTACT_273264]. In addition, subjects will be informed to never undergo diathermy if a Sprint
MicroLead fragment remains in the body.  
12) Risks associated with MRITissue damage may occur if a subject undergoes an MRI procedure while the Sprint
MicroLead, or a fragment of the Sprint MicroLead, is in the body. The risk of tissue
damage associated with MRI use is rare.  
Should a subject require a scheduled MRI during the treatment phase, the Sprint
MicroLead will be removed. The decision to remove any remaining fragments will depend

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 52/71on a careful assessment of the benefits of the MRI, risks of MRI with retained fr agments
and risks associated with removing of electrode fragments.  
13) Risk of allergic reaction to local anesthetics and/or risk of accidental injection of local
anesthetic into a vein
There is a risk that the subject may have an allergic reaction to the local anesthetic used
during the treatment phase prior to insertion of the Sprint MicroLead. If the subject were
to have an allergic reaction, it would usually happen while the subject was still in the
clinic. If a subject complains of itching, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness and
dizziness, or a swollen tongue (common signs of an allergic reaction), appropriate
medical treatment will be administered. The risk of allergic reaction to local anesthetics is
rare. In addition, there is a risk of adverse central nervous system and/or cardiovascular
effects (including a rare risk that the subject’s heart can stop beating or that they could
stop breathing) if the local anesthetic is administered improperly . 
The risks of allergy to local anesthetic agents will be reduced b y excluding subjects with a
prior known history of allergy or sensitivity to local anesthetic agents. In addition, prior
to the procedure, subjects will be advised of the signs and symptoms of an allergic
reaction. Because subjects will be awake during this procedure, they will be able to
verbalize any itching or other signs of allergy to the local anesthetic. The risks of
accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic will be reduced by [CONTACT_273265]. Careful administration includes ensuring that a vein
has not been punctured by [CONTACT_273266]. In addition, the physical location of the anesthetic injection (in
the deltoid) combined with the injection technique would rarely result in an accidental
intravascular injection.  
14) Risk associated with venipuncture (if applicable)The risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of puncture, possible
bruising and swelling around the puncture site, an infection, and faintness from the
procedure. The risks of discomfort, bruising, and swelling around the puncture site are
common while the risks of infection and fainting are rare. Blood sample collections are
only required in subjects taking warfarin.  
Subjects taking warfarin are at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_273161].
However, the risk of discomfort and bruising at that puncture site will be reduced by
[CONTACT_273267]. The rare risk of infection due to venipuncture will be reduced by [CONTACT_273215][INVESTIGATOR_273162].
Some subjects may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to the discomfort of
needle insertion or anxiety associated with the procedure. The risk of fainting will be
reduced by [CONTACT_273268]. Subjects with a history of v asovagal
responses will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_273141].  
15) Risk of worsening of pain symptomsIt is possible that the subject may have a worsening of pain symptoms or that they may
not obtain any therapeutic benefit from the treatment. The risk of worsening pain
symptoms is uncommon. In addition, subjects will have the opportunity to discontinue
treatment if their stimulation is too uncomfortable.  
These risks are mitigated by [CONTACT_273217]. Subjects do not have
access to make changes to the programming controls and thus could not advertently
change the value.  
16) Risks of Outcomes AssessmentsThe questionnaires and Fugl-Meyer Assessment present no risks. The assessments of
shoulder torque and kinematics may be slightly uncomfortable. The measures of central
sensitization (mechanical pain thresholds for hyperalgesia, pi[INVESTIGATOR_273129], temporal summation of repetitive pin-prick stimuli) may be slightly
uncomfortable and may cause brief skin irritation. The optional measures (tactile/touch,
vibration and thermal/thermal pain detection thresholds, temporal summation of
repetitive thermal stimuli, and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM)) also may be
uncomfortable and may cause brief skin irritation.

Note: The Smartpatch System discussed here has been renamed the Sprint
PNS System subsequent to FDA clearance.  
Principals of SPR Therapeutics (a subsidiary of NDI Medical) and NDI
Medical have been involved in the study of peripheral nerve stimulation
through percutaneous lead placement for the treatment of post-stroke
shoulder pain for more than a decade. Current SPR and NDI staff
participated in sponsoring and managing the published studies (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124].
John Chae, who continues these studies and is an advisor to SPR) described
below. Using the identical Smartpatch Lead and identical stimulus
parameters, percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation for the treatment of
post-stroke shoulder pain has been evaluated in multiple studies at Case
Western Reserve University by [CONTACT_273277].  
Yu, Chae, and colleagues conducted a double-blind crossover trial to
determine whether sensation associated with percutaneous electrical
stimulation is less painful than sensation associated with surface electrical
stimulation. Subjects rated the pain of each treatment modality using a VAS
and the Pain Rating Index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The median
scores on the VAS and the Pain Rating Index were lower for percutaneousGive a brief summary.

p=0.018, respectively), indicating less pain with percutaneous electrical
stimulation. In addition, nine out of ten subjects stated that they would
prefer to receive percutaneous electrical stimulation over surface electrical
stimulation.  
A case report of a chronic stroke patient suffering from shoulder
subluxation and pain, who was unable to tolerate surface electrical
stimulation, suggested initial clinical feasibility of six weeks of
percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation for the treatment of post-stroke
shoulder pain. The authors, including current SPR staff, then conducted an
exploratory case series in which eight chronic stroke survivors received six
weeks of percutaneous electrical stimulation to their posterior deltoid and
supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_173181]. Subjects experienced a significant improvement in
subluxation and self-reported pain. Furthermore, this study also
demonstrated significant improvement in pain related quality of life based
on the pain domain of SF-36.  
Yu, Chae and associates, including current SPR and NDI staff, then went on
to enroll [ADDRESS_333796]-EOT. The primary outcome measure was the same as in the
present study (BPI [INVESTIGATOR_273168]). However, these data were collected on
the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_273169] a subject diary. Secondary measures included the
same Pain Interference Question of the BPI (BPI 9) as is planned for use in
the present study and a variety of physical functioning assessments,
including pain-free passive external rotation range of motion (ROM) of the
glenohumeral joint.The group receiving electrical stimulation demonstrated a significantly
higher success rate (as measured by a minimum 2-point reduction on the
scale) than the control group (84% vs. 31%, p=.001 at the end of
treatment; and 63% vs. 21%, p=.001 for all follow-up visits). In addition,
34% (11 subjects) of the group receiving electrical stimulation were pain
free (reported “0”, indicating no pain) at the EOT compared to only 3.4%
(one subject) in the control group. 
The [ADDRESS_333797] and
free of infection during the 7-week indwelling period. Of the 128 leads
placed in this study, the tips of five leads (3.9%) among four subjects
(12.5%) broke during removal, none of which resulted in an adverse event.
Granuloma formation defined as localized tissue inflammation exhibited by
[CONTACT_12070], swelling, or pain at the lead exit site was noted for five leads
(3.9%) in two subjects (6.3%). All granulomas resolved after lead removal
with no further intervention required.  
The authors concluded that percutaneous electrical stimulation is safe and
effective in reducing post-stroke shoulder pain, with sustained pain
reduction in a cohort of subjects to at least [ADDRESS_333798]
electrodes to ensure effective positioning.

without, received three weeks of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation, 6-
hrs daily via a single Smartpatch Lead placed between the motor points of
the middle and posterior deltoids, which produced strong contractions of
both muscles. The primary outcome measure was pain intensity (BPI 3) on
the short form of the BPI. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that
participants experienced significant reduction in pain intensity. Participants
also experienced significant reduction in pain interference with daily
activities based on BPI 9 (F=5.9, p<0.01), and significant improvement in
QoL based on the bodily pain component of the SF-36 (F=12.8, p<0.001).
All 8 participants exhibited significant pain reduction at EOT. This study
indicated that the three-week, single-lead approach produced pain relief
comparable to the more complex six week, 4-lead approach. The three
participants without subluxation all exhibited substantial pain reduction,
which reinforced that pain reduction is not mediated by [CONTACT_273278] a necessary inclusion criterion.  
Additional testing was conducted in 5 subjects to validate the design of the
Smartpatch Stimulator and other external components. This design
validation of a non-stimulating Smartpatch System provided evidence that
the Smartpatch System meets user needs regarding usability and comfort.
Physical aspects of system usage, such as making cable connections,
attachment between Stimulator and Pad, and attachment to the skin, were
reported as easy and acceptable. Software aspects of the Smartpatch
Stimulator usage, such as starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_157147], identifying the
battery level, and adjusting stimulus intensity were all reported as easy
and acceptable.  
Furthermore, a stimulating Smartpatch System has been used by 3 subjects
to date in an ongoing IDE study being conducted under G090085. In this
protocol, the system is used in the Trial Stage for determining eligibility for
our implantable system. All three subjects completed the Trial Stage and
were able to use the Smartpatch components successfully to deliver their
stimulation therapy. Subjects completed satisfaction surveys upon
completion of Smartpatch System use. All three subjects reported that it
was easy to understand how to use the Smartpatch System and that the
System was easy to operate. Two subjects reported that the pad wasn’t
sticky enough, sometimes causing them to use more than one Pad per day.
Subjects in the proposed study will be given more guidance on the proper
preparation of the skin to ensure pad adhesion. The subjects reported that
the covering bandages used were of an acceptable adhesion and size, but
two subjects reported that the Lead Connector Tapes were difficult to use.
All three subjects reported that the system as comfortable, “not at all”
bothersome to wear, and that they were comfortable going out in public
with the system on. The subjects reported that they were satisfied with
their experience in the study, felt that the study had a positive impact on
their lives, and would recommend participation in the study to a friend. 21.[ADDRESS_333799] all research personnel authorized to use the study device:

21.23  How will this medical device be used in research?  
Percutaneous PNS System: The Sprint PNS System (SPR Therapeutics, Cleveland,
OH) will be used to deliver the PNS therapy. The System consists of a small external
stimulator, percutaneous lead, and pad. The external stimulator “snaps” on to the
pad. The pad has an embedded power source for the System but also serves as the
anode. The pad is replaced regularly based on treatment parameters, allowing the
investigative team to prescribe the total dosage based upon the number of pads.
The single-channel stimulator outputs a biphasic current waveform with current
pulse parameter ranges that are suitable for PNS. These electrodes have been used
extensively to deliver percutaneous PNS to shoulder muscles. [6-12,62,71]  
Lead Placement Procedure:  Give a brief description.

Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for Shoulder Pain: Dose Response. Document Date: 12/18/2020
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 61/71The procedure will be performed under a sterile condition. The location and depth of
the electrode implant site are determined by [CONTACT_273279]. [6,9,62,70] The introducer loaded with the lead is inserted perpendicular
to the skin surface and advanced to the depth (3-4 cm) defined by [CONTACT_273280]. The introducer is then withdrawn with the electrode retained in the
muscle by a barb at its tip. 
PNS Treatment Protocol:  
After one week for lead stabilization [80], the Sprint PNS System will be
programmed for stimulation. Based on over 30-yrs of experience, the Cleveland FES
Center established parameters for safe and effective delivery of PNS (pulse
frequency = 12 Hz; pulse amplitude = 20 mA; pulse duration = 5-200 usec (set by
[CONTACT_30223]); duty cycle = 2-sec ramp-up, 16-sec plateau, 2-sec ramp down, 10 sec
off; daily dose = 6 hrs/day). [81] These parameters provide strong fused
comfortable muscle contraction with minimal fatigue. [6-12,49,62,71,82-84]
Stimulation frequency and amplitude are fixed. The pulse duration is set to produce
strong, comfortable contraction of both the middle and posterior deltoids. A
balanced biphasic waveform allows an equal amount of current to flow in either
phase, creating a safe net zero charge. [85] In this dose-response study,
participants receive 3h, 6h, or 9h of stimulation each day. The stimulator keeps an
electronic log for compliance monitoring.  
Electrode and Electrode Site Surveillance and Electrode Removal: All caregivers and
participants will be trained in the assessment of electrode site and the daily
placement of the Sprint Pad. The caregiver conducts daily inspections to detect
complications. The nurse coordinator inspects the site for infection and performs
motor/sensory threshold testing for lead migration and lead integrity, respectively,
at the following times: within 48-72 hrs of lead placement, at the beginning of PNS
treatment, and at the end of treatment. Inspection and testing of motor/sensory
thresholds and impedance may also occur anytime during the 3-wk PNS treatment
period as deemed necessary. At the end of treatment, the electrode is removed by
[CONTACT_273182]. All participants undergo r adiographic
surveillance for retained electrode fragments.  21.[ADDRESS_333800] all possible complications:  
Complications are addressed in the Risks for the Study (duplicated from 10.5):  
1) Risks associated with needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead placement
There are minor risks associated with inserting a Lead through the skin with a
needle. These risks are similar to the risks of any needle injection including the
possibilities of puncturing a blood vessel, irritating a nerve, and temporary bruising
or pain at the insertion site. The risks of puncturing a blood v essel and irritating a
nerve are uncommon, but the risks of temporary bruising and pain at the insertion
site are common.  
Some participants may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to the
discomfort or anxiety associated with of the procedure, especially among those with
prior history of “fainting.” This risk is rare and may be associated with symptoms of
lightheadedness, dizziness and or diaphoresis with concomitant reduction in blood
pressure and heart rate. For those with prior history of “fainting” the procedure will
be performed with the subject in the lateral decubitus position.  
To minimize the risks associated with percutaneously placing fine wire leads, only
appropriately trained physician investigators will perform the procedure. In addition,
the risk of excessive bleeding will be reduced by [CONTACT_273218] > 3.0 and by [CONTACT_273219]. Finally, the risk of discomfort during
the procedure will be reduced by [CONTACT_273220].  
It is possible that, in some cases, multiple attempts may be required to achieve
appropriate placement of the Lead during the procedure. Each additional attempt at
Lead placement carries the same risks as the initial attempt described in this
section.  
2) Risk of skin irritation, infection, or inflammation at the Sprint MicroLead exit site
There are risks of leaving a Sprint MicroLead in place for [ADDRESS_333801] all complications.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 62/71irritation, infection, and granuloma formation (mild tissue inflammation) at the Lead
exit site. Symptoms include redness, swelling, or pain. The risk of skin irritation is
common while the risks of infection and granuloma formation are rare.  
These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_273221]. The insertion site
will be covered with a dressing to keep it clean and dry, and the subjects and their
caregivers will be instructed to inspect the site for signs of infection or irritation
regularly and to inform the Investigator if they occur. If infection or skin irritation
occurs, the Investigator will administer an antibiotic and/or remove the Lead.
Infections are rare and typi[INVESTIGATOR_273170].  
It should be noted that in a completed clinical trial of percutaneous intr amuscular
electrical stimulation, one patient death occurred. The subject did not follow the
instructions for the care of the Lead exit site and also did not return for his
scheduled follow-up visit following electrode placement. He developed an electrode
related infection and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The cause of death is thought to be a
myocardial infarction or a pulmonary embolus, but the exact cause of the death and
its relationship to the infection are not known. To mitigate the potential risk of
serious infection, a 48-72 hour safety check will be performed after the procedure.
Participants will return to the clinic and the exit site will be evaluated for signs of
infection.  
3) Risk of the Sprint MicroLead breaking beneath the skinThere is a possibility of a Lead breaking beneath the skin either during the course of
the study or during the procedure to remo v
e Lead. This risk is uncommon. However,
when a Lead breaks, one or more Lead fragments usually remain in the body. The
Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine if the removal of such fragments
is necessary. Visual inspection of the Lead after it has been removed as well as x-
rays will be used to determine if any Lead fragments remain. The risk associated
with the x-rays is no greater than that associated with conventional clinical x-rays. If
the Investigator determines a Lead fragment has been retained in the body, he/she
will determine what is medically required to further evaluate and treat this retained
fragment. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], no treatment is required unless there are further sequelae, such
as an infection or granuloma, associated with the fragment.  
The risk of leaving a Lead fragment is minimized by [CONTACT_273259]. In this protocol, a
single Sprint MicroLead will be implanted for just 4 weeks.  
4) Risk of infection associated with retained Sprint MicroLead fragmentsA Lead fragment could result in the formation of a granuloma or infection. Although
the occurrence of a fr
agment-related infection or granuloma is uncommon an
infection may require removal of the Lead fragment and/or treatment with
antibiotics. Investigators at the Cleveland FES Center and Case Western Reserve
University have over [ADDRESS_333802] been developed as well as the extensive
experience of the Investigators..  
5) Risks associated with lead fragment removalIt is possible that a Lead fragment or fragments ma
y be retained in the body
following removal of the Sprint MicroLead. If the Investigator determines that a lead
fragment has been retained, the Investigator will instruct the subject and his/her
caregiver to carefully inspect the Sprint MicroLead exit site and the surrounding skin
in the weeks subsequent to Lead removal. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273281], redness, swelling, discharge, or the
appearance of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45886]-like mass (skin abscess). Such signs indicate that the
fragment has migrated to the skin surface. At that time, if clinically warranted, the
fragment may be removed via an outpatient procedure which involves lancing the
abscess and removing the fragment and application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_11978].  
The risks associated with the Lead fragment removal procedure include discomfort
during the procedure and skin irritation or infection in the area of the retained
fragment. These risks are rare. The risk of infection is mitigated by [CONTACT_273282]/or his caregiver to carefully monitor the site and immediately report any
signs of infection.

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 63/716) Risk of Lead Replacement due to Lead Migration or Lead Becoming Dislodged
It is possible that the Lead may migrate from its original intended location or that
the Lead may become dislodged (i.e. come out completely) during the treatment
phase. This risk is rare. If lead migration occurs, it is possible that the subject may
experience discomfort during stimulation (described further below under “risk of
discomfort with electrical stimulation”). If the Lead has migrated substantially or has
come out, it may be necessary to place another Lead. Each time an additional lead
is placed, the subject has an additional exposure to the same risks of lead
placement described above in “risk of needle insertion for Sprint MicroLead
placement”.  
This risk of lead migration or the becoming dislodged is mitigated by [CONTACT_273223], as appropriate, to ensure careful handling of the
Lead and Lead Connector during bandage changes. In addition, the risk of placing a
new lead is further mitigated by [CONTACT_273224], ensuring that the shoulder tissue appears health y prior to
placing a new lead, and collecting an additional INR blood sample for subjects who
are taking warfarin.  
7) Risk of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad or bandagesIt is possible that the skin could become irritated under the Sprint P ad. Additionally,
there may be skin irritation in the area surrounding the Lead insertion site, where
an adhesive bandage is taped to the skin. This risk is common; however, the
bandages can be changed to prevent the irritation from returning.  
The risks of skin irritation under the Sprint Pad (a modified surface electrode) and
under the bandages surrounding the Sprint MicroLead exit site will be reduced b y
excluding patients with known sensitivity to skin surface electrodes and/or medical-
grade adhesive tapes. Subjects and their caregivers will be advised to examine the
electrode exit site at regular intervals to look for any signs of irritation. To avoid
irritation under the Sprint Pad, subjects will be advised that the Sprint Stimulator
and Sprint Pad may be moved to slightly different locations near the Lead insertion
site throughout the treatment phase. In addition, subjects will be instructed to a void
placing the Sprint Pad or bandages on unhealthy skin.  
8) Risk of mechanical or electrical failure of the Sprint StimulatorThere is a rare chance that the Sprint Stimulator may malfunction. It is very unlikely
that a stimulator malfunction will be harmful. If there is a problem with the Sprint
Stimulator or the Sprint MicroLead, the Stimulator will reset itself such that no
stimulation is delivered.  
The Sprint Stimulator will not deliver stimulation if it detects a high impedance level
indicating a broken lead wire or a faulty lead connection. Subjects will be instructed
to contact [CONTACT_273225].  
9) Risks for pregnant womenThe risk of harm to a pregnant woman or fetus is unknown. The device will not be
used in any subjects known to be pregnant. If a subject is known to become
pregnant during the treatment phase, stimulation will be stopped and the Sprint
MicroLead will be removed.  
Potential risks of pregnancy will be reduced by [CONTACT_17801] a pregnancy test in
females of reproductive potential at study enrollment. Additionally, the Informed
Consent form will advise subjects that the risks of electrical stimulation during
pregnancy are unknown and that they should immediately notify the Investigator if
they suspect they have become pregnant during the study. 
10) Risk of discomfort due to electrical stimulationIntramuscular electrical stimulation may be perceived by [CONTACT_2180] a tingling or
vibrating sensation, which may feel uncomfortable or painful. The risk of discomfort
due to stimulation is uncommon. At high stimulation intensities, shoulder pain may
worsen.  
To minimize the risk of increased shoulder pain as the result of high intensity
stimulation, the Investigator will set an appropriate intensity for the stimulation.
Should a subject feel pain as the result of stimulation, he or she will be able to turn
off the stimulation using the Sprint Stimulator controls. Although muscle fatigue is

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 64/71unlikely with six hours of daily stimulation therapy, subjects may also feel some
discomfort if muscle fatigue occurs. If muscle fatigue is observ ed, the Investigator is
able to prescribe several shorter stimulation sessions totaling six hours per day.  
Discomfort or pain due to stimulation may occur if the Sprint MicroLead migrates
from its original location. Stimulation near the skin surface ma y be perceived as a
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” or stinging sensation and may be uncomfortable.  
The risk of pain due to a migrating electrode will be minimized by [CONTACT_273226] e. The Sprint
MicroLead has a fine wire barb. In addition, the proximal portion of the Lead exits
the skin which makes this Lead more susceptible to becoming dislodged during
bandage changes. As a conservative measure, we allow one week for encapsulation
of the Sprint MicroLead to ensure stability. Data on the Lead has shown that
electrodes are fully encapsulated by [CONTACT_273209].  
A tingling sensation may be felt under the Sprint Pad but this sensation is not
expected to be uncomfortable. If discomfort or pain is felt at the Sprint P ad site, the
subject will be instructed to turn off stimulation and move the Sprint Pad and
Stimulator to a different location.  
11) Risks associated with DiathermyThere is a risk of tissue damage if a subject undergoes diatherm y. Shortwave or
microwave diathermy is a therapy that may be used to apply deep therapeutic heat
for the treatment of selected medical conditions such as relief of pain, muscle
spasms, and joint contractures. Diathermy can cause excessive heating of any
implanted metal part (including Leads), resulting in serious injury . The risk of tissue
damage associated with diathermy is rare.  
The risk of diathermy will be reduced by [CONTACT_273283]. In addition, subjects will be informed to never undergo diathermy if a
Sprint MicroLead fragment remains in the body.  
12) Risks associated with MRITissue damage may occur if a subject undergoes an MRI procedure while the Sprint
MicroLead, or a fragment of the Sprint MicroLead, is in the body. The risk of tissue
damage associated with MRI use is rare.  
Should a subject require a scheduled MRI during the treatment phase, the Sprint
MicroLead will be removed. The decision to remove any remaining fragments will
depend on a careful assessment of the benefits of the MRI, risks of MRI with
retained fragments and risks associated with removing of electrode fragments.
13) Risk of allergic reaction to local anesthetics and/or risk of accidental injection of
local anesthetic into a veinThere is a risk that the subject may have an allergic reaction to the local anesthetic
used during the treatment phase prior to insertion of the Sprint MicroLead. If the
subject were to have an allergic reaction, it would usually happen while the subject
was still in the clinic. If a subject complains of itching, difficulty breathing,
lightheadedness and dizziness, or a swollen tongue (common signs of an allergic
reaction), appropriate medical treatment will be administered. The risk of allergic
reaction to local anesthetics is rare. In addition, there is a risk of adverse central
nervous system and/or cardiovascular effects (including a rare risk that the subject’s
heart can stop beating or that they could stop breathing) if the local anesthetic is
administered improperly.  
The risks of allergy to local anesthetic agents will be reduced b y excluding subjects
with a prior known history of allergy or sensitivity to local anesthetic agents. In
addition, prior to the procedure, subjects will be advised of the signs and symptoms
of an allergic reaction. Because subjects will be awake during this procedure, they
will be able to verbalize any itching or other signs of allergy to the local anesthetic.
The risks of accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic will be reduced by
[CONTACT_273212]. Careful administration includes
ensuring that a vein has not been punctured by [CONTACT_273228]. In addition, the ph ysical
location of the anesthetic injection (in the deltoid) combined with the injection
technique would rarely result in an accidental intravascular injection.  
14) Risk associated with venipuncture (if applicable)

https://mhirb.metrohealth.org/IRB/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity .Entity%5BOID%5B111D262BB79 … 65/71The risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of puncture,
possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site, an infection, and faintness
from the procedure. The risks of discomfort, bruising, and swelling around the
puncture site are common while the risks of infection and fainting are r are. Blood
sample collections are only required in subjects taking warfarin.  
Subjects taking warfarin are at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_273144]. However, the risk of discomfort and bruising at that puncture site will
be reduced by [CONTACT_273229]. The rare risk of infection due to
venipuncture will be reduced by [CONTACT_273230][INVESTIGATOR_273145].  
Some subjects may experience a vasovagal (“fainting”) response due to the
discomfort of needle insertion or anxiety associated with the procedure. The risk of
fainting will be reduced by [CONTACT_273231]. Subjects with a
history of vasovagal responses will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_273141].  
15) Risk of worsening of pain symptomsIt is possible that the subject may hav
e a worsening of pain symptoms or that they
may not obtain any therapeutic benefit from the treatment. The risk of worsening
pain symptoms is uncommon. In addition, subjects will have the opportunity to
discontinue treatment if their stimulation is too uncomfortable.  
These risks are mitigated by [CONTACT_273217]. Subjects do not have
access to make changes to the programming controls and thus could not advertently
change the value.  
16) Risks of Outcomes AssessmentsThe questionnaires and Fugl-Meyer Assessment present no risks. The assessments
of shoulder torque and kinematics ma y be slightly uncomfortable. The measures of
centr
al sensitization (mechanical pain thresholds for hyperalgesia, pi[INVESTIGATOR_273171], temporal summation of repetitive pin-prick stimuli) may
be slightly uncomfortable and may cause brief skin irritation. The optional measures
(tactile/touch, vibration and thermal/thermal pain detection thresholds, temporal
summation of repetitive thermal stimuli, and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM))
also may be uncomfortable and may cause brief skin irritation.  
17) OtherSome of the survey questions present a rare risk of psy
chological harm.  
When PHI is involved there is the rare risk of a privacy breach.  
There may be other risks as yet unknown.

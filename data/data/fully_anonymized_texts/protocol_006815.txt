Objective  
 
Short term objective: Among a small group of veterans with diabetes, we aim to test the efficacy of an 
individually tailored lifestyle modification intervention based on objectively assessed physical activity patterns 
and associated contextual environment in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269].  
Specific Aims  
In veterans aged ≥ 60 years with diabetes, the specific aims are:  
AIM 1 . To examine how PA relates to the contextual environment and social participation (i.e., ability to 
participate in daily life ac tivities and satisfaction with participation) .   
Hypothesis 1:  Lower levels of weekly and daily PA will be associated with a greater number of physical and 
social environmental barriers and less social participation.   
AIM [ADDRESS_55694] the efficacy of an individually tailored lifestyle modification PA intervention base d on objectively 
assessed PA patterns and associated contextual environment in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269].   
Hypothesis 2a:  At the end of [ADDRESS_55695] control grou p.  
Hypothesis 2b : At the end of [ADDRESS_55696] control group.  
AIM 3:  To further refine the intervention in preparation of a larger trial and to disseminate the intervention, we 
will conduct post -intervention interviews to assess the subject experience of the intervention.  
 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH DIABETES NEED IMPROVEMENT  
Regular physical activities benefit diabetes -related  clinical outcomes, particularly older adults  
Type 2 d iabetes is a prevalent and debilitating  chronic disease  that d isproportionally affects middle -
aged and older adults ; 13% of adults aged 45 -64 years and 27% of adults aged ≥65 years had diabetes in 
2010.1  The p revalence of veterans  with diabetes  is similarly high, and is increasing:  6.7% in 1998 (~490,000 
veterans) and 19.6% in 2000 (~740,000 veterans) ;an incidence estimated to be 2% per year.[ADDRESS_55697] common geriatric condition s, such as 
depression,5 cognitive impairment,6 falls,6 and pain,7  which are associated with physical  disability.8   
The health benefit of regular physical activities (PA) among patients with diabetes is well recognized. It 
includes improvement of glycemic control  and the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, such 
as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and nephropathy.[ADDRESS_55698] 150 minutes of moderate 
activity (e.g., walking) per week, in addition to weight loss of 5 -10% of body weight.[ADDRESS_55699] demonstrated PA -associated improvements in  physical 
function disability, cognitive function, better quality of life,  and less depression. 9    
 
Contextual environments are one of the barriers to PA  
Regular PA may prevent or delay diabetes and its complications; yet, over 60% of adults with type 2 
diabetes are not physically active.11  Older adults are especially likely to be sedentary; only 12% of adults aged 
75 or older engage in 30 minutes of moderate PA 5 or more days per week, and 65% report no leisure PA.[ADDRESS_55700] , but no single intervention led to consistent 
positive results ,12 and many of older adults with chronic medical conditions and geriatric condition s were not 
included in current PA interventions.12,13,14   
 
3 | P a g e  
 As summarized in Tables 1 
and 2, the barriers and motivators 
of PA can be broadly described as  
internal and external factors .15 18   
The internal factors are influenced 
by [CONTACT_39359]’s own decision -
making, whereas the external 
factors  involve an individual’s 
contextual environment , both  social 
and physical environment unique 
for the individual, and are factors 
that are independent of an 
individual’s decisio n-making. As 
Conn et al.[ADDRESS_55701] one chronic condition, aged ≥ 60 years, and 
the interv ention will be standardized and tailored according to the individual’s baseline PA pattern and 
contextual environment.  
 
THEORIES AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR THE INTERVENTION  
The ICF model  is the basis of the lifestyle intervention  
The World Health Organization developed the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and 
Health (ICF ) model  as a framework on health and disability. The ICF model shows the interaction between 
individual health status and life situation  (Figure 1).19,[ADDRESS_55702] levels: body function/structure, activity, and 
participation.  Bodily function/structure  refers to 
specific detailed functional abilities and impairments 
(e.g., visual impairment); Activities  are what people 
can do inherently without assistance or barriers or  
function at an individual’s level (e.g., able to run a 
mile); Participation  refers to functioning taking into 
account the impact of barriers and facilitators in the 
environment, or functi oning as a result of the 
interaction between the individual and his/her 
contextual environment.20   
The dynamic interactions of the various PA 
barriers and facilitators among diabetic patients can 
easily be described by [CONTACT_52511] ( Figure 2 ).  
Older adults with diabetes, as previously shown, have 
numerous barriers similar to those described by [CONTACT_52512] .  An example is that a person ’s with diabetic  neuropathy  (i.e., 
body function impairment ) has difficulty walking 100 feet (i.e., activities ), but still completed a  in a 5K walk (i.e., 
participation ) to raise funds for breast cancer research because her co -workers are walking with her  
(contextual environment) .  
Social participation is a meaningful and measurable outcome for PA interventions involving older adults  
Social participation, the focus of the proposed project, is one of the main outcomes of rehabilitation and 
a common intervention goal of many health pro fessionals.21  It is an important modifiable variable that 
influences community living and has been associated with health, mortality ,22 morbidity ,23 and quality of life.21,24  
Participation has been shown to decrease in normal aging,25 be more restricted by [CONTACT_52513]26  and Table 1 .15-17

 not be totally explained by 
[CONTACT_52514].25,27 Social 
participation  is defined in 
terms of the level of 
accomplishment in daily 
activities and social roles, 
therefore it’s reasonable to 
believe that interventions 
affecting one’s daily activities 
(i.e., lifestyle intervention) will  
affect social participation , as 
proposed in this research 
(Figure 2 ). For the proposed 
project, the terms social 
participation  and participation  will be used interchangeably.  
We will assess participation  using  the validated questionnaires  developed by [CONTACT_33230] -Reported 
Outcomes Measurement In formation System (PROMIS). PROMIS questionnaires were developed and tested 
in older adult population with available population mean and standard deviation.  Social participation  overlaps 
with Social Health  in the PROMIS  domains ,28  and is defined by 2 subdomains  per PROMIS workgroup : ability 
to participate and satisfaction with participation .  
Ability to participate  is most consistent with participation restrictions, which occurred when “probl ems an 
individual may experience in involvement in life situations”  arise .[ADDRESS_55703] an individual's 
perception of his/her optimal participation level.[ADDRESS_55704] functioning such as 
stroke and traumatic brain injury report participation outcomes at the societal level to be more imp ortant than 
outcomes at physiological or individual level of functioning.34 Satisfaction with participation among older adults 
with chronic diseases such as diabetes ha s not been investigated.   
 
Social participation may be improved through lifestyle -based PA interventions  involving  contextual environ ment  
According to the ICF m odel, environmental factors are critically important in the participation of an 
individual (Figure 1), and should be targeted in health interventions.[ADDRESS_55705] as 
facilitators or barriers for participation among community -dwelling older adults; it’s unclear if these factors may 
have similar effect on social participation  and PA among veterans with diabetes ( Figure 2 ).  
An individual’s environment, social and physical, can affect social and PA participation. Social isolation 
was found to be associated with less PA among patients with mental illness through accelerometer -assisted 
assessment.[ADDRESS_55706] on their participation  than those with less physical limitations.  Thus, it’s 
logical that lifestyle -base PA intervention  to improve the ability to function (i.e., more PA) within the 
environment or reduce physical limitations , may improve participation  as proposed in the current project.  
In fact, despi[INVESTIGATOR_52496], PA interventions to prevent falls 
among older adults have been s hown to improve participation .[ADDRESS_55707] size  of PA interventions on 
participation  was small (standardi zed mean difference = 0.16) . However, when PA was delivered as one 
component of the intervention, not just the single intervention, the effects were larger. This finding is consistent 
with the ICF model, where  participation  is the result  of interaction s with physical and social factors. PA 
interventions incorporating the multiple  components of  ICF models  such as the contextual environment  will 
likely lead to greater improvement in social  participation . Figure 2.  

 
5 | P a g e  
 Given the importance of contextual environment in social participation  21 and PA interve ntions, we 
decided to use the Measure of the Quality of the Environment (MQE) version 2.[ADDRESS_55708] comprehensive questionnaires of self -perceived physical and social environment, and 
has been widely used in participation  research. It assesses both the number of environment barriers/facilitators 
and individuals’ perception of how the environmen t affects them. We were unable to  identify any diabetes -
specific questionnaires assessing this level of detail environmental inf ormation,  
 
TAILORED LIFESYTLE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO INCREASE PA PARTICIPATION  
Tailored lifestyle  PA intervention s are indicated for older adults with diabetes  
The 2010 position statement s from American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American 
Diabe tes Association (ADA) recommend  that programs promoting PA should focus on developi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -efficacy 
and fostering s ocial support, and that encouraging mild or moderate PA may be most beneficial to adoption 
and maintenance of regular PA participation.38  Although g reater and more intense PA is generally beneficial 
for older adults, such activities may also increase injury risk.39-41  Additionally, older adults  with diabetes are 
heterogeneous regarding their physical function status and co -morbidities  (see Work Accomplished) , so the 
same single  PA goal of requi ring one to perform moderate to vigorous exercise for [ADDRESS_55709] managing their diseases is already overw helming,  42 leaving limited time to 
participate in other activities. Therefore, individually tailored PA interventions based on the person’s health 
status, daily routines , and physical function  capabilities may be more practical.   
Recent studies have found that levels of PA lower than previous ly recommended for cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_52498] (e.g., below 50% VO 2max) also enhance glucose tolerance, improve coronary risk factor profile, 
and reduce  cardiovascular -related mortality.43  Furthermore, patients with lower baseline PA status are likely to 
experience greater health benefit with a giv en increase in PA, usually with longer and /or more frequent 
exercise sessions.[ADDRESS_55710] served with exercise of lower in tensity but longer 
duration and /or more frequent.   
  
Tailoring based on  PA patterns  and contextual environment may improve PA and social participation  
Tailored lifestyle intervention based on individuals’ patterns of  PA is promising for older adults, although 
has not been tested in older veterans with diabetes. Gardiner et al .45 provided counseling for older adults aged 
≥60 years based on their patterns of sedentary time and PA obtained from an accelerometer,  and was 
successful at reducing  sedentary time (3.2% reduction) . The study wa s a pre-post study with no controlled 
group, so efficacy of the intervention can’t be assessed. The participants were relatively thin, the authors did 
not disclose information on co-morbidity and physical function , and s ocial participation was not assessed.  
[CONTACT_52546]’s group has developed a standardized protocol of lifestyle tailoring based on a combination 
of PA patterns and momentary symptoms of pain and fatigue. This protocol w as shown to be feasible in a 
sample of veterans with osteoarthritis ,[ADDRESS_55711]. Murphy’s group co unseled part icipants to increase their PA  while avoiding too much 
pain or fatigue. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of symptoms of pain or fatigue was obtained  
through the assistance of an accelerometer  similar to the one to be used in the propos ed study .  
EMA is a field -based method to reliably obt ain immediate -recalled data, as opposed to delayed recall, 
in natural settings.  It is a powerful tool that allows researchers to identify opportunities to impact health 
behaviors.  For example, [CONTACT_52546]’s group asked the participants to wear an a ccelerometer that record ed 
their PA in small epochs  and also  prompt ed them several times  a day to record their symptoms. Based on this 
information, they were able to link the PA ( i.e., more active, less active) with symptoms (i.e., pain). Then, 
participants can be counseled to pace their PA by [CONTACT_52515], so that they can maintain PA 
on a regular basis w ithout exacerbation of symptoms .46,[ADDRESS_55712]. Murphy ’s group46 to tailor the 
lifestyle intervention based on the individual vet eran’s baseline PA pattern  and the contextual environment 
associated with the activities .  A trained occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]  (OT) will teach the veteran s strategies to 
increase their PA while adapt ing to their environment . Through this intervention, the goal is for the veteran to  
 
6 | P a g e  
 increase PA and social participation . This method of tailoring is likely to be effective in diabetic veterans  
because previous studies already shown that tailoring based on PA patterns may improve PA , and with the 
addition of environment information , a common factor that can influence both  PA and social participation, our 
intervention is likely to improve both PA and social participation.  OTs are ideal candidates to deliver the 
intervention, as they are professionally  trained to use strategies to promote the capacity of individuals to 
participate in satisfying daily activities by [CONTACT_52516]’s capacity to perform  and the activity being 
performed while adapting to the environment in which the activity is performed .48  
 
Self-regulation theory  forms the basis of the proposed lifestyle intervention  
In order to effectively improve  an individual’s participation in PA, we operationalized the steps of s elf- 
regulation based on the s ocial cognitive theory  - one of the most promising health behavior theories  for 
lifestyle -based PA interventions .[ADDRESS_55713] observe  
[self-observation]  his/her condition , then make  judgments based o n observation [self-evaluation ], and react 
appropriately to achieve personal goals by [CONTACT_52517]’s own behavior [ self-reaction ].  In fact, many 
physically inactive adults  were unaware that they are in fact inactive ,[ADDRESS_55714] important step in any 
PA interventions; our proposed intervention will begin by [CONTACT_52518] .  These 
adults (aged ≥ 60 years) also prioritized social engagement to be more important (and enjoyable) than PA, 
suggesting th at PA interventi ons targeting them  should also assess their social participation as a potential 
motivator and outcome. [ Aims 1 and 2 ] 
To operationalize steps of self -regulation in the proposed project, we w ill first use an accelerometer and 
logbook to assess  an individual’s PA pattern and contextual environment  in the home environment  [AIM 1 ] to 
enhance his/her observation  of PA ( or l ack of  PA). We will then teach the individual to self-evaluate their PA 
and social participation level and to identify available opportunities  to increase PA and social participation.  
Following this, the trained OT will teach each individual various strategies  to modify his/her lifestyle  to improve 
PA. Based on the interaction between participation  and environment as described in the ICF model , we believe 
this intervention will not only  increase PA but also improve social participation  [AIM 2]. 
 In order to best tailor the intervention for individual veterans, the proposed CDA will integrate 
environmental, personal, and behavioral factors49,51 into the intervention through a standardized protocol. The 
contextual environment such as cars and computers can be a “motivator” or “facilitator” on PA behavior, and 
thus will be systematically assessed. Personal (self) influences, which include prior kn owledge, self -efficacy 
beliefs, goals or intentions, will be addressed.  A goal is more influential and motivating to change behavior if it 
has a more closely held value and is salient for the individual.  As discussed above, the goals to reverse or 
improv e illness or disability are often not achievable in a short time; however, goals such as improvement of 
social participation  may be more attainable, therefore, motivating for older adults. For example, it may be more 
difficult to lose 10% body weight throu gh dieting than to add an hour of play time with the grandkids.   
In conclusion, as behavior is a function of the person and the person’s environment,[ADDRESS_55715] be approached through a tailored lifestyle intervention based on the individual’s environment to 
optimally impact participation.  
 
PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
Work Accomplished  
1. Older adults with diabetes have worse p hysical function limitations and more co-morbidities  than those 
without diabetes or with pre -diabetes.58  
We performed a c ross-sectional analysis of 5,991 respondents aged ≥ [ADDRESS_55716] of the 
Health and Retirement Study , a nationally representative health survey .  All respondents reported physical 
function limitations and co -morbidities (chronic diseases and geriatric conditions).  We found 21% of 
respondents  had diabetes , and they had  the highest prevalence of co -morbidities and physi cal function 
limitations, followed by [CONTACT_52519], then normoglycemia (p<0.05).  Among diabetic respondents, 
48% had mobility limitations (walking several blocks and /or climbing a flight of stairs), and 69% had lower 
 
7 | P a g e  
 extremity limitations (gett ing up from a chair and /or stoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/kneeling/crouching).  Compared to respondents 
without diabetes, respondents with diabetes had higher odds of having functional limitations affecting mobility 
and lower extremity functioning (OR=2.13 – 2.92, all p<0.01 ). 
➔ Co-morbidities and physical function limitations are prevalent among middle -aged and older adults with 
diabetes. Effective lifestyle interventions for diabetic patients  must accommodate physical function 
limitations. These findings support  our interventio n approach to use  tailoring to accommodate their pre -
existing co -morbidities and functional limitations.   
 
2. Sedentary older adults with diabetes are more likely to participate in PA involving daily life routines than 
other types of PA  (Lee P, Blaum  C, Alexander N; Poster presentation at the Annual Meeting of the 
Gerontological Society of America, 2013 ) 
Using a cohort of sedentary adult aged 60 -85 with diabetes (n=115) enrolled in a PA enhancement trial, we 
analyzed what types of self -reported PA, as  per Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors 
(CHAMPS) questionnaire, did they participated in 4 weeks prior to enrolling in the study.  Latent class modeling 
was fitted, after excluding items such as basketball, soccer, racquetball, running,  where <[ADDRESS_55717] participated in. We were able to classify the respondents into 3 classes: 60% almost 
exclusively participated in activities involving daily life routines, and the other 40% participated in some 
activities involving vo litional PA such as walking for exercise, stretching, or strength training.  Individuals were 
more likely to participate in activities involving daily life routines than other types of physical activities (all 
p<0.05).  
➔ This study provides support for the proposed intervention to incorporate PA into an individual’s daily life 
routines.  
   
3. Diabetes is associated with poor mobility and less physical activity in symptomatic osteoarthritis patients   
(Lee P, Alexander N, Murphy S; Poster presented at  the Annual Meeting of the Gerontological Society of 
America, 2013 ) 
We analyzed data from participants recruited for a life -style intervention trial by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Murphy’s group: 
community -living adults aged ≥65 years with mild to moderately painful knee or hip O A and fatigue. We 
assessed mobility by [CONTACT_52520] -minute Walk distance (6MW; feet) and PA by [CONTACT_2329] a wrist -worn accelerometer 
(Actiwatch) over 7 days (average count/ day). Linear regression models were performed to examine the 
contribution of diabetes, age, body mass index, pain, and self -reported disability on mobility and on PA.   
We found that diabetic participants (n=20, mean age 72) were more obese  than non-diabetic participants 
(n=147, mean age 72). Diabetic participants had shorter 6MW distance (β= -131.87, p=0.03), adjusting for age, 
BMI, pain and disability. They were less physically active, adjusting for age and BMI (β= -55.78, p=0.03).   
➔ Diabetes can be a barrier to PA among adults with OA, and adults with OA and diabetes need additional 
support to p articipate in PA.  This study confirms that it’s feasible to use Actiwatch to assess PA among 
older adults with diabetes, that these participants are able to use the Actiwatch and logbooks to record their 
momentary symptoms of fatigue and activities, which  are key components of the proposed CDA. The 
acceptance of this study protocol among the participants also supports the proposed intervention.  
 
4. Geriatric conditions, which are associated with physical disability , begin to develop in middle -aged adults  
with diabetes.59 
We performed a f ollow -up analysis of data from  Health and Retirement Study waves 2004 and  2006, including 
respondents  aged  ≥ 51 years in 2004 (n=18,908). We examined the prevalence and two -year cumulative 
incidence of eight geriatric conditions (cognitive impairment, falls, incontinence, poor nutrition, dizziness, vision 
impairment, hearing im pairment, pain) and their association with diabetes.  We found that a dults with diabetes, 
compared to those without, had increased prevalence and incidence of geriatric conditions across the age 
spectrum (p<.01 for all  ages through 75 -79 years old). Diabete s was associated with the two -year cumulative 
incidence of acquiring new geriatric conditions ( OR= 1.7, 95%CI 1.3-2.2).  
➔ Middle -aged adults, as well as older adults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of 
geriatric conditions, which contribute substantially to their complex health status. These findings provided 
support for our study to include middle -aged  veterans, and tailor our intervention  to accommodate the ir 
complex health conditions and the contextual environment (physical and social) .

Study Design  
This is a randomized -controlled trial to test the efficacy of a tailored lifestyle -based PA intervention, among 
veterans aged ≥ [ADDRESS_55718] control

Recruitment  
Setting:  
The study will take place at the main campus of VA Ann Arbor Health System, located in Ann Arbor, which 
serves nearly 57,[ADDRESS_55720] Ohio (fiscal year 2011). 
More than 455,[ADDRESS_55721] 16% veterans are expected to have diabetes  and more than 70% of veterans are either 
overweight or obese; obesity is a single major risk factor for diabetes.60  According to CDC estimates, 27% of 
adults aged ≥[ADDRESS_55722] diabetes;1 thus, similar number of veterans with diabetes is expected. . We will primarily 
recruit subjects from 4 resources:  
1. Referrals from VA health providers, including primary care providers, geriatricians, endocrinologists, and 
other subspecialist who care for diabetic patients.  
2. Direct advertisement through local newspaper and at the VA for potential subjects.  
3. Referrals from the VA Ann Arbor MOVE! program. The MOVE! program in VA Ann Arbor provided care for 
[ADDRESS_55723] time participants in MOVE ! program;61  50% of the MOVE! 
participants have diabetes.[ADDRESS_55724]’s approval to screen for diabetic patients using the VA

Figure [ADDRESS_55730] -worn accelerometer  for 7 
days to monitor home activities.  Subjects who successfully completed the baseline 7 -day home monitoring will 
be randomized into 2 arms: intervention or wait - list control groups . The intervention group will rece ive the 
tailored PA report in a  one-hour counseling session, followed by [CONTACT_52524] [ADDRESS_55731] control group will receive monthly phone calls to discuss about their health status but not PA -
related issues. These monthly phone calls are necessary to maintain  the subjects’ interest in staying in the 
trial. The wait -list control will receive the tailored PA pattern report and the counseling intervention at the end of 
the study.  
 
Both arms of the study will have post -intervention  assessment at 5 weeks after rand omization and final 
outcomes assessment  6 months after randomization .  Each outcomes assessment involves surveys, physical 
function assessment, and a 7 -day home monitoring period.  After the 6 -month  assessment, we will interview 
participants who completed the intervention to assess their experience for the purpose of improving  the 
intervention in the future.  
 
Research Procedures  
 
Baseline data colle ction: Aim 1  
If potential participants meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on phone screening, then they will be 
invited for baseline evaluation. Baseline data collection will be completed in 4 steps from 3 sources: 
accelerometer -generated PA patterns, the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of contextual 
environment, and survey data. We estimate the time to complete baseline assessment will be 1.[ADDRESS_55732] 65.  
2. The research assistant (RA) will guide the participants  to complete a packet of survey  question s. The 
questionnaires will ask about  demographics, co -morbidities, physical activity (self -reported), social 
participation , their perception of the influence of contextual environment (physical and social environment)  
on daily liv es, and potential barriers  and facilitators of diabetes care.  
3. The RA  will direct the participants to complete a standardized education module , where they will learn to 
use the wrist-worn accelerometer  to rate their response to pre -determine d questions  using a numerical 
 
11 | P a g e  
 rating scale and entering responses , and to record addition information on activities and /or barriers or 
facilitators to PA in an accompanying logbook. [CONTACT_52546]’s group has already refined this education 
module to teach older veterans with osteoarthritis and low back pain to use a similar accelerometer  and 
logbook to obtain data on PA and symptoms. We will adapt [CONTACT_52546]’s education module for this study.  
The accelerometers are des igned for assessment of  PA patterns over time and will be worn by [CONTACT_52525] 7 continuous days (allowing capture of data on both weekdays and weekends).  
At five  pre-determined times throu ghout the day, the accelerometer s will prompt the participants to enter  
response s to 3 pre-determine d questions to assess their perception of the contextual environment  on their 
ability to participate in PA and social activities  (i.e., momentary assessment of the environment) .  Based on 
experience by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Murphy’s group, we will set the accelerometer alarm at wake up  time, 11am, 3pm, 7pm, and 
before bedtime.  Time for waking up and going to bed will be individualized for each participant.   Each 
participant will know when their acc elerometer alarm will go off. This will help the participant to pay attention to 
the alarm.  
- Participants will  become familiar with an accompanying logbook, in which participants will record the 
exact environment and activities they were inv olved in at two -hour intervals ( See Appendix for the  mock 
Activity L og).The logbook provides supplementary data that are important for the tailoring intervention, 
and also serves to cross -validate the items entered in the accelerometer. The logbook will be used as a 
back -up if there are missing data from the accelerometer.  
- During  this teaching module, p articipants are given the opportunity to practice rating their environment 
and using the accelerometer’s input button to record the information. If, for some reason, participants 
fail the learning module (e.g., inability to press th e input button) they will be excluded. Although we 
have not encountered exclusion for this reason in any of our past studies, this reporting is central to the 
tailoring portion of the intervention and therefore is an important criterion for study inclusion .  
- This education module will take approximately [ADDRESS_55733] of the questions they need to answer and examples of activities, potential barriers or 
facilitators to PA.  
4. Participants will then wear  the accelerometer and  complete their logbook s for a 7 -day home monitoring 
period and then return the materials to the study team via a postage -paid mailing envelope. At that time, 
Aim 1 portion of the study (or baseline data collection) will end.   
 
Randomization  
Randomization was done upon enrollment . Once participants complete d baseli ne data collection successfully, 
they will be automatically  assigned  into intervention or wait -list control group. To ensure that both groups have 
same number of partic ipants, and avoid investigator bias and confounding, we will randomize by  [CONTACT_52526] .[ADDRESS_55734] control  group  will 
be notified that they are enrolled in the study but that they will not be able to start the active intervention for 6 
months .   
Intervention to be delivered for intervention group  
Intervention is tailored based on  each individual participant’s  baseli ne objectively measured PA pattern (i.e., 
not active for all day or only active at certain periods of the day), and ecological momentary assessment of the 
participant’s contextual environment. Together these data inform  the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_52499] s of activiti es are most 
likely to be performed by [CONTACT_52527] a good opportunity to increase or add PA . The strategies 
to increase PA will take into account of each individual’s self -reported barriers of PA.  
 
An occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT)  will deliv er the intervention; this OT will have underwent training by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Murphy’s group to deliver standardized lifestyle -based PA intervention using accelerometer –measured PA 
patterns .  [CONTACT_52546]’s group has already established standardized training protocol for OT  to deliver this type 
of tailoring  intervention .  Additionally, as discussed in the Background, OT’s approach es to lifestyle intervention 
are most befitting for this populatio n (older, high risk for disability, sedentary, restricted by [CONTACT_52528], 
etc.). In the future, we will test the intervention delivery through other trained providers  such as a nurse 
educator.   For the study, t he participan t will meet with an OT for a one -hour session for the following activities:   
 
12 | P a g e  
 1. Brief presentation on the benefits of PA and how to safely perform PA at an older age and with diabetes. 
Each participant will leave the session with a National Institute of Aging exercise workbook67 and tips to 
exercise safely with diabetes.68  
2. The OT  will review the baseline PA pattern report determined from the home monitoring period.   This report 
is prepared before the counseling session.   It also summarizes the participant’s self -reported perception of 
the environment, his/her daily activities and the associated context . The OT will help the participant to 
correlate the level of PA with potential barriers ass ociated with PA at that moment.  For example, bein g 
alone may be associated with few  activities, but atten ding church is associated with more  activities. The OT 
will focus  on periods where the relationship between PA and an identifiable and modifiable barrier is most 
salient. (See Appendix for a mock Baseline Physical Activity R eport)  
3. Based on th e baseline PA  report, the OT will teach the study participant  potential strategies to incorporate 
PA int o daily life routines . These strate gies will accommodate for the individual physical and social 
environment and health barriers. Generic strategies from Gardiner et al .45 will be adapted to reduce 
sedentary time and increase PA, with particular emphasis in activities involving the social environment  
(See Appendix for a sample of Strategies  to Increase Physical Activity ) . Participants will identify  strategies 
specifıc to their circumstances , and will leave the session with a list of these strategies .  For example: A 
participant’s  home monitoring report shows a n hour of inactivity o n Monday. The logbook shows  that he 
accompanied his wife to her medical appointment and arrived 30 minutes early. The OT may recommend: 
“Instead of sitting in the lobby [CONTACT_52529], you (maybe your wife too), can walk 
around the cl inic while waiting. In fact, many clinics also have stair  cases , so you may want to use the 
opportunity to walk up and down a flight of stairs a few times while waiting.”   
4. The OT will conclude the session by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_52500] a realistic goal to increase  PA, and to 
operationalize the 3 steps of s elf-regulation  using a PA tracker worksheet similar to the one used for 
baseline activity assessment (See Appendix for an example of a Physical Activity Worksheet). The 
participant  will be encouraged to complete the worksheet daily or at least [ADDRESS_55735] by [CONTACT_52530]/her activities, 
using the strategies provided to them during the counseling session.  
5. After the face -to-face session, the same OT will make weekly phone calls to the participants for 4 weeks  
(See Appendix for a Flowchart of the Phone C all). The OT will already have been trained  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Murphy’s 
group  to make these phone calls following the flowchart, demonstrated an understanding of the program, 
learned  to address the various actions on the flowchart (i.e., how to probe for barriers, how to help with  
problem solving, etc.), and how to respond to participants’ various questions.  The OT will ask the 
participant questions based on their response to the PA worksheet as described above. Then, u sing the 
answers to the PA worksheet as a guide, the OT will review with participant s the steps of the self -
regulation, provide positive rei nforcement, assess progress in achieving PA goals, problem solve barriers, 
and discuss changes in medications and health status .  Each phone call will last approximately  [ADDRESS_55736]-intervention  assessment  will be  done 5 weeks after randomization to  assess if  the intense intervention 
(counseling and weekly phone calls) had an immediate impact on the study participants. Potential participant 
drop o uts are expected at the [ADDRESS_55737] control group  will be assessed for all  outcomes, inclu ding the 7 -day home monitoring.  
 
 
13 | P a g e  
 After the post -intervention assessment, a RA  will contact [CONTACT_52531] 6 -month final 
assessment to discuss changes in medications and health status. PA issues will not be discussed. The goals 
of these phone calls are to obtain updated health information and maintain the participants’ interest in 
remaining in the trial.  
          Measures  
Primary outcomes:   
a) Physical activity  will be assessed 
using data from Actiwatch Score  
and a validated survey  – 
Community Healthy Activities Model 
Program for Seniors ( CHAMPS ).[ADDRESS_55738]-worn 
accelerometer ( Actiwatch Score , 
Phillips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770] -Mini Mitter Co, 
Bend OR; see Figure 4) to measure 
the PA because it is the only device 
that allows concurrent reporting of momentary a ctivity data and measurement of PA. Waist -worn 
accelerometers that are cheaper do not allow momentary activity reporting. It is not meant to provide 
feedback to the participant (as a pedometer); it is a clinical tool in which information is synthesized for  the 
intervention as described in our study.  
 
The wrist -worn accelerometer will be mounted on each participant’s non -
dominant wrist. Although it is worn on the wrist, it is highly associated with 
whole -body movement.72,[ADDRESS_55739] excellent reliability between units ( r= .98) and has established 
preliminary criterion validity among a sample of chronic pain patients.76  
Three main PA measurements are derived from the Actiwatch: 1) average 
activity counts/minute reflects average level of PA over a specified time 
period; 2) peak PA (largest daily activity count averaged over 7 days) is a 
measure of daily activity intensity; and 3) total PA is the 7 -day cumulative 
activity score at times when a person was deemed awake and excluding 
missing data that occurred from te mporary removal of the Actiwatch.  We will 
look at average activity counts and total activity counts that occur: 1) in different context, 2) over each day, 
and 3) over the 7 day period. Because participants wear the accelerometer continuously for 7 days, i t is 
necessary to establish participants’ wake -up and bedtimes. A previously -established algorithm will be used 
to corroborate participant -report of wake and bedtimes with the objective measures.    
 
2. Physical activity  will also be self -reported by h aving the study participants completing  the Community 
Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS)  questionnaire .71  CHAMPS is a self -administered  
questionnaire  developed for  underactive populations and tested primarily among older  adults. The  
questionnaire  included 41 items,  asking the respondent to report the participati on in specific activities that 
older adults are likely to engage in. The responses are “YES” or “NO” to an activity, and if “YES”, then the  Baseline  Post-
intervent ion During the 
intervention  3 and 6

 number of times per week and total hours per week of activity participation.  From the questionnaire, we 
can derive  measures of frequency per week and estimated caloric expen diture per week in PA.  For both 
frequency and caloric expenditure, two measures  can be  derived based on: 1) PA of moderate or greater 
intensity (MET value ≥3.0), and 2) all specified PA that included activities of light intensity in addition to 
moderate a nd greater . The 6-month reliability coefficients for total and moderate -intensity  activities were 
0.66 and 0.76, respectively.71   
 
b) Social participation  will be meas ured from the 2 sources  (Please see Appendix for questionnaire) : 
Social participation  will be measured at each assessment point using validated question naires  from the 
Patient -Reported Outcomes  Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) assessment center .77  Together, 
these questions  (51 items ) assess two subdomains of social participation  - ability to participate  and 
satisfaction with participation .[ADDRESS_55740] their ratings (1-5) into 
the logbook daily during the 7 -day home monitoring period s: “I am satisfied with my current level of social 
activity ; I am satisfied with my ability to  perform my daily routines ; and I am satisfied with my ability to do 
leisure activities .” 
Secondary outcomes:   
a) Functional status  will be assessed by [ADDRESS_55741] 64 – A participant will be instructed to walk at his/her usual pace for six 
minutes and distance covered in feet is recorded.  
2. Timed Up and Go Test 65 – A participant will be timed (in seconds) when get up from sitting in a chair, 
walk 3 meters, tur n around, and walk back to sit down.   
3.  Comfortable gait speed in 10 meter walking.  
4. Rosow, Breslau and Nagi  activities81-84 – Self-reported ability to run a mile, walk 1 or several blocks, sit 
for 2 hours, get up from a chair after sitting for a while, climb 1 or several flights of stairs, lift or carry over 
10 lbs., stoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/crouching/kneeling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] a dime up, reach or extend arms, and pulling/pushing large 
objects.  
b)  Biomarke rs: A1c and b ody mass index  will be assessed at baseline and at the final (or 6 -month) follow -up.  
A1c measures average blood glucose level in the past 3 months.  At the t ime when participants visit VA 
Ann Arbor for baseline and final assessment , they will be ask to go to the VA Ann Arbor’s Ambulatory Care 
laboratory to have a random blood sample  obtained by [CONTACT_52532] A1c value.  Standard scales 
used in Ambulatory care clinics will be used to measure the height and weight of each participant.  
c)  Quality of life  will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_6731]-12, which is a well validated 12 -item questionnaire that assesses 
both the physical and mental health quality of life  of veterans . 
d)  Participant  retention  is the extent to which our program is able to retain the intended audience to 
complete the study . 86  Results from participation retention provide information on the acceptance of the 
intervention by [CONTACT_52533]. Retention can be calculated as [(participants completing post intervention 
assessment/participants enrolled ) x 100].  
 
15 | P a g e  
 e) Intervention feedba ck is an important goal for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. It will inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52501], added, or removed to improve the intervention for future  trials and for 
dissemination. The information will be obtain ed in two ways at the end of the study:  
1. Participant satisfaction  with the program , including participant perception of usefulness of proposed 
intervention, will be measured by a series of Likert scale satisfaction items  adapted from the measures  
used by [CONTACT_52534] .87 (See A ppendix) .    
 
dverse event rates : Participants can report an AE event by [CONTACT_52535] -up phone 
calls. The AEs will be tracked electronically in a participant management system.  Study -related AEs will be 
classif ied as serious if they require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52502].   All other study -related 
AEs will be classified as minor, resulting in minimal or no disability and not requiring hosp italization.   If a 
participant experiences a severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, that participant will be temporarily suspended 
and will need to obtain medical clearance from his or her medical provider before resuming the 
intervention.  The intervention cloc k will continue to run during the suspension and end of study will not be 
delayed.  
g) Medication changes: The intervention may lead to increase physical activities, which may lead to lower 
blood glucose, lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, all possibl e outcomes associated with regular 
physical activities.  The subjects’ health care providers are likely to make medication changes whe n 
glucose, blood pressure, and / or cholesterol levels are lowered with the progression of the study.  
Therefore, medication s associated with lowering glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, will be assessed 
for changes by [CONTACT_52536]’s VA electronic medical record (CPRS).  
 
Co-variates , predictors and confounders :  
1. Environment:  Contextual environment  may be barriers or facilitators for PA  and social participation , and will 
be assessed at baseline using a survey, momentary assessment using the Actiwatch , and data from logbook . 
a) Measure of the Quality of the Environment (MQE)  version 2.[ADDRESS_55742] comprehensive 
meas urement instruments that address specific ICF categories of environmental factors.88  (See Appendix) 
This level of detail information is important for our intervention as it involves using strategies to overcome 
the environment barriers within the individual’s daily life routines .  MQE assess es [ADDRESS_55743] relevant to the proposed study: physical environment (40 i tems) and social 
environment (69 items). It also assesses an individual’s perception of the environment on his/her ability to 
accomplish daily activities or tasks and social roles. The perception is rated on a 7 -point Likert scale 
ranging from -3 (major ob stacle) to 3 (major facilitator). Therefore, MQE produces 2 levels of data: 1) 
number of self -perceived environment barriers /facilitators , and 2) the perceived level of influence a 
barrier/ facilitator on the person . 
b) Momentary assessment of the environment  will be obtained through the Actiwatch prompting the 
participant to record their perception of the environment on their ability to participate in PA and social 
activities. This method of obtaining immediate -recalled data (vs., delayed recall) in natural settings,  
ecological momentary assessment (EMA), is a new research method that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52503], and the momentary information ob tained will be exploratory, but important in informing the 
intervention to target those barriers that have the most impact on the activities. To our knowledge, this 
method has not been used in lifestyle interventions in our study population.  During the baseline 7-day 
home monitoring period, the study participants will enter their perception  of the physical and social 
environment, into the accelerometer  5 times a day . The questions for the participants will be the following:  
1. “Considering your current surrou ndings , indicate to what extent do they  hinder you or prevent you from 
being physically active? ” Answers range from 0 to10. 
2. “Considering your current surroundings,  indicate to what extent do they hinder  you or prevent you from 
performing daily routines ?” Answers range from 0 to 10.  
3. “Are you currently with someone?” Answer s are either  0 or 1 (0=No; 1=yes) . 
c) Description of activities and the involved context  (i.e., what, where, with whom) in 2-hour intervals will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_52537] e 7-day home 
monitoring period.  An example:  7-9pm on Saturday - dinner, at restaurant, with family. The logbook will 
provide more descriptive data on the environment a nd other activities that a participant engaged in a day. 
 
16 | P a g e  
 This information will be used in the study for the sole purpose of generating tailored reports on individual 
environment -activity relationships over the week for the tailored activity intervention in  Aim 2 . 
2.  Potential confounders including age, race, sex, global health status, co -morbidities  (Charlson Comorbidity 
Index89), depression, attitudes and beliefs about  PA and diabetes care  will be assessed using validated 
questionnaires:  
- Geriatric Depression Scale  (GDS) 90 Short Form is a 15 -item questionnaire to screen for depression. It has 
been extensively used in community, acute and long -term care settings .  GDS has 92% sensitivity and 89% 
specificity when evaluated against di agnostic criteria.  It will take 5 -7 minutes to complete.  
- Diabetes Care Profile (DCP)  [ADDRESS_55744] ed subsets of questions from DCP to assess  diabetes -related 
attitudes and PA barriers , which are important factors for the study. We estimate it will take 10 -15 minutes to 
complete these subsets of questions.  
 
Strategies for Ensuring Treatment Fidelity  Treatment fidelity is defined as “the procedures used to monitor 
and enhance the reliab ility and validity of behavioral interventions,”  and is an essential component of our study. 
Per recommendations from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) behavior change consortium,[ADDRESS_55745] (i.e., occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) training 
and monitoring based on previously developed protocol by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Murphy’s group.   Another area of treatment 
fidelity that we will address relates to how the treatment is rec eived by [CONTACT_2299]. This involves an 
assessment of individual factors such as comprehension of information, and the ability to use and perform 
skills associated with both the data collection and behavioral elements of the study. We have a standardize d 
interactive learning module to teach the participant how to input ecological momentary activities in the wrist -
worn accelerometer. Because the validity of the ecological momentary activity information is central to our 
tailoring methods, all participants  will undergo this learning module prior to their first session with the OT. At 
the end of the study, we will conduct interviews with each participant to examine their experiences in the 
intervention including adherence with steps of the self -regulation pr ocess.  
 
 
Statistical Analysis  
Univariate analyses  
Before conducting formal analysis for each specific aim, descriptive analyses will be performed based on 
univariate st atistics, using t -tests for continuous variables or chi -square tests for categorical variables. This will 
involve inspection of univariate statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis for 
continuous variables, and frequency ta bulations for categorical data. We will also inspect for outliers and 
inspect bivariate plots of PA and participation data over time for each person to identify outliers in the bivariate 
relationships. All analyses, including descriptive statistics and mod el fitting, will be carried out using SAS for 
Windows, release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., 2002 -2008, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).  
 
Primary analyses  
Aim 1:  To examine  the relationship between PA, contextual environment (physical and social environment), 
and social participation, among veterans with diabetes.   
Hypothesis 1 : Lower levels of weekly and daily PA will be associated with a greater number of physical and 
social environmental barriers and less social participation.   
 
Since PA is measured by [CONTACT_52538] -reported by [CONTACT_52539], we will first compare them with 
correlation analyses and identify the correlation coefficient. We will then use separate linear regression models 
to evaluate if environmental barriers (MQE) and social participation  (PROMIS) predict PA, adjusting for 
baseline co -variates and potential confounders.  Separate models will be used for the two different PA 
measurements - CHAMPS and Actiwatch.  
 
 
17 | P a g e  
  
We will then explore if the perception of 
environment barriers to PA and 
participation and satisfaction with 
participation fluctuate daily.  Longitudinal 
analysis models will be  built with time as 
covariate and each of these variables as 
the ou tcome. These variables are 
assessed daily during the home 
monitoring period by [ADDRESS_55746] study 
participants’ answers to some if not all  of 
these questions to vary daily. We will 
then build separate predictive models using hierar chical linear modeling (HLM) if change in the perception of 
the environment  or satisfaction with participation is associated with PA (Actiwatch daily average count s). The 
HLMs will allow us to fully utilize the repeated measures  of the environment, participation, and PA within each 
day.   
   
Aim 2:  To pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a randomized -controlled trial to test the efficacy of an individually tailored lifestyle -based PA 
intervention . An intent -to-treat analysis will be applied to avoid various misleading artifacts that can arise in the 
trial; all subjects initially enrolled in the trial will be accounted for based on the group they were randomized 
into. Baseline comparison of the control and intervention group s will be done with ANOVA on PA, participation, 
and all the co -variates.  We will consult our statistician  for analysis guidance.  
 
Hypothesis 2a:  At the end of [ADDRESS_55747] increas ed PA compared 
to the control group.  PA is measured in 3 ways using Actiwatch and CHAMPS ( Table 5 ), so three separate 
analyses will be done using each measure – Actiwatch  daily average counts and weekly counts, and CHAMPS 
weekly measurement.  
 
The primary analysis is based on comparing the [ADDRESS_55748] for potential confounding, s eparate models of m ultivariate regression analyses will 
be conducted with each measure of PA as the dependent variable, randomization arm as a predictor, baseline 
PA as a covariate, and potential confounders including age, sex, 
diabetes statu s, and number and perception of environment barriers will 
be included in the model.   Assuming that residuals from the model fit are 
normally distributed, the analysis is equivalent to a classical analysis of 
covariance. For data that does not fit a normal distribution, inverse, 
logarithmic or power transformations will be performed or generalized 
linear models (GLM) with Poisson or gamma error will be considered.  
 
To further assess if the pattern of PA change d, i.e., whether the change 
in PA occurred across each day or just a few days in a week , we will 
graphically compare the daily average counts  at 6-month follow -up for 
the interventi on group with the control group  (Figure  5). For example:   If Y ij = daily average counts  at day j over 
[ADDRESS_55749] i and j = 1 ( d1), 2 (d2)…, 7(d7), then we will try to fit the linear mixed model 
to test if the slop es of the two PA curves are the same  and t est for overall difference ( β1 = 0 ):   
Yij = β 0 + β1*intervention  + β2*days + β3*z + εij  
 
With this small sample of [ADDRESS_55750] size of the treatment which will allow us to better estimate the sample size 
needed for a larger trial.  Table 5.

Figure 5.  
 
18 | P a g e  
  
Hypothesis 2b: At the end of [ADDRESS_55751] improved social 
participation (ability to participate  and satisfaction with participation ).  Social participation will be measured with 
the PROMIS questionnaires with a population mean of [ADDRESS_55752] deviation of 10. The change in social 
participation  will be compared  between the treatment and control group s by t-tests, similar to the analysis plan 
described for Hypothesis 2a . Multivariate regres sion analyses will be conducted to evaluate  confounding 
factors, with social participation as the dependent variable, randomi zation arm as a predictor, baseline social 
participation as a covariate . Potential confound ers including age, sex, co-morbidities , and number and 
perception of environment barriers will be included in the model.  Distribution of the residuals from model fit will 
be examined, and additional transformations and generalized linear models will be considered.  
 
Additional analyses:  
Further exploration of effects at e ach time points are of interest.  Models will utilize outcome measurements  at 
all time -points (baseline, 5 weeks, and 6 months). Different outcome measures and covariates can be 
evaluated. Repeated measure longitudinal models can be considered:  
For example: Outcome at 5 weeks and 6 months = BA + G + CF + G*TIME + CF*TIME,   
where BA=outcome at b aseline; G=intervention group; CF= one or more contributing factors; TIME= time 
variable; *=interaction between variables. The key aspe cts of this model for hypotheses 2a and 2b are 
interactions G*TIME and CF*TIME, and the magnitude and significance of these interaction effects provide 
insight into mechanisms underlying study group differences. The remaining terms are used to reflect stud y 
design and adjust for baseline values. This analysis will yield three tests: 1) a test for outcome changes over 
time of the study, 2) a test of the intervention vs. control group differences (an intervention effect), and 3) a test 
for interaction of inte rvention effect with time. As in the primary hypothesis, we are primarily interested in the 
overall intervention effect. However, a changing intervention effect over time, as reflected in intervention by 
[CONTACT_52540] a greater impact as time 
progresses, which would provide support for long -term effect of the intervention. The following methods will be 
considered: linear mixed effects (LME) models for continuous variables with normally  distributed residuals; and 
generalized linear models (GLM). Both of these methods allow for unbalanced data, time -varying covariates, 
and structured covariance matrices. Repeated measures models will be developed in the framework of linear 
mixed effects (LME) models or generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM).  
 
AIM 3:  To assess participant satisfaction with the intervention, we will use a series of Likert scale satisfaction 
items and a semi -structured interview protocol including open -ended questions to obtain feedbacks.  A 
quantitative analysis and a qualitative analysis will be performed for this aim:  
- Results from the Likert scale satisfaction items will be analyzed to identify the association between different 
characteristics of the study participants and their satisfaction with the intervention. Participant characteristics 
(e.g., age, sex, race, ed ucation background, functional status, co-morbidities , etc.) will be cross -tabulated with 
the satisfaction outcomes, which can be dichotomized into satisfied or not satisfied. Individual relationships will 
be assessed using Χ2 tests . Multiple logistic anal yses will be used to analyze responses according to each 
factor, controlling for socio -demographic variables.  
- Qualitative analysis plan will be directed by [CONTACT_52541] s, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52504]. The goal of this analysis is to identify if there are uniform theme s in the feedbacks 
provided by [CONTACT_52542].  
 
Secondary analyses  
For c hange in functional status, biomarkers , and quality of life  at 6-month  follow -up, separate l inear regression 
analyses  will be performed, adjusting for important covariates (age,  sex, co-morbidities, etc.) . Effect of the 
intervention on the outcomes will be analyzed using a simple follow -up analysis: y i1=В0+В1Xi+εi, where  y i1 is 
the follow up measurement at 6-month follow up ,  В 1 is the  change in mean outcomes at follow up between the 
2 treatment groups, and X i is the membership of being in the intervention group.  
 
Data Management : Data will be entered using case report forms created in Microsoft Access with encrypted 
password -protected file and stored on a pass -word protected deskt op computer in a locked office.  Each record

Missing Data : With repeated mea surement on each subject on the key outcome variable s, some missing data 
is expected, despi[INVESTIGATOR_52506] -up. To get an understanding of the mechanism of missingness we will 
collect the reasons for missing data such as “death”, “patient refusal due to poor health”, or “patient refusal 
unrelated to health”.  We will compare the distribution of lost patients by [CONTACT_52543]. We will compare the rate of losses to follow -up among the 
two groups using the chi -square test of associatio n.  In the event that the rate of losses differs among the 
groups, interpretation of the results will be made in view of this finding.  We will also assess whether any 
baseline characteristics of subjects are associated with losses to follow -up using chi -square tests for 
categorical baseline data and analysis of variance for continuous baseline data.  If baseline variables are found 
to be associated with the loss to follow -up, then the analysis models to meet the aims will be modified to 
include the differi ng baseline variables as covariates.  By [CONTACT_52544] m.

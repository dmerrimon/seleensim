Interventions
and
Duration
Live-Online
M-ROCC:
The
live-online
M-ROCC
program
is
directly
adapted
from
Mindfulness
Training
for
Primary
Care
(MTPC),
which
was
developed
and
tested
in
the
MINDFUL-PC
research
study
and
pi[INVESTIGATOR_601773]
R21
study .
M-ROCC
is
based
on
a
model
of
human
experience
which
identifies
experiential
avoidance
and
disconnection
from
our
bodies
and
from
others
as
fundamental
causes
of
human
distress,
and
addictive
behavior
in
particular .
M-ROCC
is
a
6-month
long
Mindful
Recovery
OUD
Care
Continuum
designed
with
the
clinical
needs
of
OUD
participants
to
be
delivered
in
primary
care
clinics.
Due
to
COVID-19,
this
study
will
test
the
curriculum
delivered
in
a
virtual
setting
online
as
a
research
intervention
separate
from
clinical
care.
Below
we
describe
the
adjustment
of
the
program
with
logistical
constraints
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
in
mind.
The
M-ROCC
curriculum
focuses
on
integration
of
mindfulness
practice
for
living
well
through
stress,
anxiety ,
depression,
pain
and
addiction
recovery .
The
M-ROCC
curriculum
has
three
primary
components.
1)
LDM
(Low-Dose
Mindfulness):
A
four-week
introductory
mindfulness
program
for
OUD
with
monthly
rolling
admission,
which
includes
50
minutes
of
mindfulness
introduction
and
explicit
training
in
the
use
of
mobile
mindfulness
22
Mindful-OBOT
Clinical
Trial
Protocol
V2.20.
apps.
LDM
introduces
participants
to
the
ascending
practice
dose
ladder .
The
live
online
session
will
be
80-90
minutes
with
30
minutes
of
group
check-in
and
online
toxicology
testing
with
staff
followed
by
60
minutes
of
the
mindfulness
program.
2)
MTPC-OUD
(Mindfulness
Training
for
Primary
Care
–
OUD):
A
sixteen-hour
curriculum
delivered
in
either
(a)
eight-week
intensive
mindfulness
group
with
an
ascending
practice
dose
ladder
and
skill
integration
over
the
course
of
the
eight
weeks,
120
minutes
per
session,
or
(b)
sixteen-week
intensive
mindfulness
group
with
an
ascending
practice
dose
ladder
and
skill
integration
over
the
course
of
sixteen
weeks
with
60
minutes
per
session.
While
the
LDM
group
format
will
be
delivered
in
the
same
manner
in
all
study
cohorts,
the
MTPC-OUD
curriculum
format
will
be
interchangeable
in
different
cohorts
depending
on
the
implementation
needs
of
group
leaders.
The
live
online
session
will
be
80-90
minutes
with
30
minutes
of
group
check-in
and
online
toxicology
testing
with
staff
followed
by
60
minutes
of
the
mindfulness
program.
3)
MCS
(Mindfulness
Maintenance
Check-in
Support):
Various
ongoing
weekly
mindfulness
continuation
groups
with
check-in
and
reminders,
leveraging
mobile
mindfulness
application
and
motivational-oriented
counseling
for
graduates
of
LDM
for
[ADDRESS_796834]
expected
duration
of
MCS
for
a
participant
who
goes
directly
from
LDM
to
MCS
and
does
not
choose
to
enroll
in
MTPC-OUD.
Free
MCS
groups
will
be
available
through
the
CMC
Free
Live
Online
Community
Program.
Within
the
M-ROCC
curriculum
there
is
flexibility ,
so
that
each
participant
who
enrolls
will
begin
in
LDM
for
four
weeks.
If
the
participant
is
able
to
develop
a
home
practice
and
begins
ascending
the
practice
ladder ,
then
they
will
be
given
the
option
to
move
to
the
intensive
MTPC-OUD
or
the
ongoing
MCS
depending
on
readiness.
Participants
can
repeat
LDM,
transfer
to
the
MCS
group
or
transition
from
the
LDM
or
MCS
into
intensive
MTPC,
forming
a
continuous
practice
and
check-in
support
continuum
that
encourages
increased
practice
with
the
spi[INVESTIGATOR_601774] ,
collaboration,
and
naturalistic
selection
based
on
participant
motivation
and
capacity .
Live-Online
Control
Group:
The
live-online
control
group
will
be
attention-
and
time-matched
to
the
M-ROCC
LDM
and
MCS
groups.
This
weekly
control
group
will
run
for
80-[ADDRESS_796835]
of
care
at
sites,
but
they
may
provide
a
therapeutic
benefit
to
participants
lacking
a
recovery
group
due
to
the
constraints
of
COVID-19.

This
estimate
is
based
on
our
experience
in
the

pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],
in
which
47%
of

and
from
OBA T
sites
in
U.S.
states
approved
by
[CONTACT_601926],
and
also
via

to
understand
procedures
and
questionnaires,
and
be
without
acute
severe

This
trial
is
limited
to
English-speaking
participants
at
this
time
since
the
intervention

have
not
been
adapted
to
other
languages.

that

Therefore,

The

such
that

can
still
receive
the

More
than
30%
of

during
the
first
year

frequently
request

Study
Rationale
This

innovations
that
will
shift

Motivationally-Responsive
MBI
:
This
is
the
first
study
to
design
and
evaluate
the
impacts
of
a
stage-oriented,
motivationally-responsive,
mindfulness
continuum.
M-ROCC
starts
with
a
focus
on
engagement
and
enhancing
confidence,
providing
flexibility
in
training
session
type
depending
on
participant
motivation.
2.
Ascending
Practice
Dose
Ladder
:
The
ascending
practice
dose
ladder
provides
steady
encouragement
throughout
and
builds
practice
confidence
and
prevents
early
dropout
from
negative
self-attributions.
3.
Live-Online
Delivery
:
No
published
RCT
of
online
MBIs
during
BUP
treatment
exists.
This
format
allows
for
MBIs
to
be
delivered
to
patients
prescribed
BUP,
even
under
the
constraints
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic.

However ,
if
the

or
higher
on
the
consent
assessment,
then
the
research
coordinator
will
administer
the
Montreal

to
assess
for
eligibility
(a

then
they
will
be
allowed
to
review

and
complete

If

then
they
will

If

then
the
screening
visit
is
over,
and
they
will
be
able
to
be
assessed
once
more
on
another
day
(since
substance
use
can

increase
psychiatric
symptoms
and
impact

performance).
On

If
the

has
a
MOCA-BLIND
score
below

on
two
separate
occasions
or
scores
less
than
90%
on
the
consent
assessment
again,
they
will
not
be
eligible.
If
both
failures
are
considered
to
be
potentially
due
to
ongoing
substance
use,
then
they
may
be
screened
again
after
30
days
if
there
has
been
a
clinically
significant
change
in
their

Investigator
(for

Once

they
will
receive
a

assessment
using

to
identify
psychiatric
diagnoses

The
16-week
MTPC-OUD
group
is
designed
to
minimize

of
both
patients
and

and
to
increase

in
primary

settings
where
scheduling
a

may
be

Whereas
the
LDM
group
is
designed
to

to
mindfulness
practice
in
an

manner ,
the
MTPC-OUD
group
is
more
similar
in
content
to
an

8-week
MBIs
in
terms
of
practice
and
content.

More
time
was
needed
to
develop

which
is
important
because
mindfulness

associated

with
unrealistic
expectations
at
the
outset,
then
self-stigma,
self-criticism,
regret,
and
avoidance
can
lead
to
dropout,
which
has
more
substantial
clinical
implications
in
OUD

(relapse,

in

other
diagnoses,

important
part
of
the
LDM
group
was
“going
from
5

to
15

In

Comparator
(Live-Online
Contr ol)
Design:
This
randomized
controlled
trial
will
employ
an
attention-
and
time-matched
live
online
control
group
as
a
standalone
comparator
intervention.
In
a
similar
manner
to
the
M-ROCC
check-in
group,
this
weekly
control
group
will
offer
participants
the
ability
to
connect
in
groups
and
discuss
the
challenges
that
they
are
facing
online
with
each
other .
This
approach
allows
for
participants
to
connect
in
a
manner
that
they
would
not
otherwise
be
able
to,
considering
that
the
majority
of
B/N
prescription
sites
are
not
offering
in-person
groups
as
a
result
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
After
completion
of
the
testing
and
check-in
groups,
the
full
group
will
come
together
for
a
45-60-minute
check-in
as
a
group.
As
an
active
group
comparator ,
this
method
will
help
to
isolate
mindfulness
aspects
by
[CONTACT_601952].
Group
content
will
derive
from
commonly
used
methods
in
community
substance
use
disorder
programs
and
recovery
groups,
including
an
eclectic
curriculum
designed
to
emulate
common
curricular
elements,
with
representation
from
commonly
implemented
evidence-based
approaches
(Motivational
Interviewing,
CBT,
Community
Reinforcement
and
Twelve
Step
Facilitation
198
),
using
engagement
and
group
building
processes
commonly
used
in
addiction
community
groups
199
.
The
manualized
group
will
be
standardized
across
each
control
group
to
ensure
low
variability
across
cohorts,
starting
with
group
check-in
and
then
presentation
of
a
skill
and/or
discussion
of
a
topic.
Administration
Participants
will
be
enrolled
on
a
rolling
basis
in
preparation
for
their
randomization
to
either
the
live-online
M-ROCC
or
live-online
control
arm.
Initially ,
randomization
will
only
occur
once
[ADDRESS_796866]
completed
baseline
measures
and
are
ready
to
start
a
group,
they
will
be
randomized
using
randomly
selected
block
sizes
of
4,
6
and
8
200
with
a
1:1
ratio
(24
weeks
of
live
online
M-ROCC
:
24
weeks
of
live
online
control
group).
Next,
after
randomization,
the
participant
will
be
informed
about
their
assignment
and
given
a
start
week
for
group
sessions
(either
live
online
control
or
live

M-ROCC
LDM)
and
will
be
given
information
about
the
group
and
its
structure
with
a
start
date
scheduled.
We
will
aim
to
recruit
constantly ,
with
a
new
M-ROCC
and
control
group
beginning
every
4-[ADDRESS_796867]
consisting
of
4-8
weeks
of
low

mindfulness
(LDM),
LDM
participants
will
be
encouraged
to
proceed
after
LDM
into
the
remainder
of
the
M-ROCC
program
with
a
naturalistic
design
to
evaluate
the
choices
and
outcomes
that
OUD
participants
make
when
engaging
in
additional
mindfulness
training
(MTPC-OUD)
and
MCS
sessions.
After
completion
of
LDM,
participants
may
repeat
with
multiple
cycles
of
LDM
or
may
enter
the
next
MTPC-OUD
group.
The
availability
of
MTPC-OUD
groups
will
depend
on
the
number
of
group
participants
interested.
Intensive
mindfulness
group-based
intervention
will
be
scheduled
after
8
participants
are
willing
to
transition
to
intensive,
but
can
only
start
when
there
is
a
critical
mass
greater
than
6
participants
to
maintain
the
syner gistic
container
effects
important
to
the
mindfulness
group
approach
176
,
such
as
common
humanity
and
learning
from
each
other ’s
experiences.
MTPC-OUD
intensive
groups
will
run
every
1-2
months
and
MCS
groups
will
be
run
continuously
in
the
form
of

is
a

following
the

which
can
be

and
would
be

for
any

who
has
completed
an
MTPC-OUD
group,
or
who
is
not
comfortable
moving
from
their
LDM
group
to
an
MTPC-OUD

We
anticipate
about
half
of
the

return

then
we

it

Handling
of
Study
Interventions
The

manual
have
been
tailored
specifically
for
participants
with
OUD
in
primary
care
buprenorphine
treatment.
Prior
to
the
start
of
the
R33
M-ROCC
groups,
the
manuals
will
be
finalized
based
on
the
remaining
participant
feedback
from
the
R21
phase,
and
merged
into
a
single
adapted,
stage-based

ladder ,
which
was
demonstrated
to
result
in
high
levels
of
daily
mindfulness
practice
among
participants
with

Consent
assessment:
The
participant
will
also
be
asked
to
complete
an
Informed
Consent
Assessment
via
REDCap
to
ensure
comprehension
of
the
study
procedures,
rights
of
participants,
as
well
as
understanding
of
the
risks
and
benefits
of
the
study .
The
participant
will
not
be
able
to
sign
the
document
without
having
at
least
90%
correct
answers
on
the
consent
assessment.
Participants
will
be
given
the
opportunity
to
review
the
study
procedures
with
a
trained
study
staff
member
if
they
fail
the
consent
assessment.
Participants
will
also
be
given
an
opportunity
to
correct

Screening
Assessments
(Consent
and
Screening
Visit)
After
participant
consent
has
been
obtained,
the
research

will
provide
the
participant
with
a
secure
REDCap
link
to
the
PROMIS-ASF ,
and
PhenX
toolkit
surveys,
as
well
as
a
secure
link
to
a
screening
CAT-MH
survey ,
to
evaluate
for
eligibility
prior
to
proceeding
with
baseline
assessments.
The
RC
will
also
supervise
an
oral
fluid
test
with
the
participant
to
assess
for
substance
use.
If
the
screening
process
suggests
that
the
participant
meets
exclusion
criteria
or
brings
up
other
questions
about
eligibility ,
then
the
RC
will
contact
[CONTACT_51336]
[INVESTIGATOR_601823].
If
a
participant’ s
PROMIS-ASF
T
score
is
greater
than
55
(Raw
>
16),
then
the
participant
will
be
determined
to
have
an
anxiety

even
if
it
was
not
previously
diagnosed
clinically .
Since
participants
with

substance
use
may
be
able
to
wait
for
a

Participants
will
be
invited
to
practice
mindfulness

which
may
involve

Increased
anxiety
due
to
difficulties
in
mental
training
program
Mindfulness
practices
can
sometimes
cause
anxiety
for
those
who
practice.
Support
from
the
Group
Leader
and
the
group
can
help
participants
recognize
that
this
anxiety
is
part
of
the
process
and
can
help
people
learn
to
manage
these
feelings.
If
meditation
and
mental
exercises
are
causing
a
worsening
of
anxiety
for
participants,
they
will
be
encouraged
within
groups
to
change
their
approach
to
the
practice.
Research
coordinators
will
assess
for
worsening
symptoms
every
two
weeks
during
the
engagement
call
adverse
events
report,
and
also
during
each
live-online
group
session.
If
the
participant(s)
are
unable
to
find
a
way
to
practice
without
eliciting
an
increase
in
symptoms,
then
they
may
be
asked
to
stop
practicing
and
to
meet
with
either
the
M-ROCC
Clinical
Director ,
the
CMC
Medical
Director ,
or
the
Principal
Investigator
[INVESTIGATOR_601831].
The
participant
may
ultimately
be
terminated
from
the
study
if
they
are
experiencing
an
adverse
reaction.
These
participants
may
continue
to
receive
other
treatments
at
their
primary
care
site
as
part
of
their
ongoing
treatment
plan.
4.
In
some
very
rare
cases,
meditation
practice
can
lead
to
a
dissociative
state
or
to
psychosis
208
.
This
is
more
likely
in
participants
with
current
conditions
of
or
a
predisposition
to
psychosis.
Participants
experiencing
active
psychosis
are
excluded
from
participating
in
this
study .
If
a
participant
begins
to
experience
these
feelings
during
his
or
her
time
in
the
study ,
then
the
study
staff
and
care
team
will
work
together
to
alert
the
appropriate

Physical
discomfort
due
to
gentle
movement
aspect
of
training.
The
training
will
involve
gentle
movements
and
stretching.
Some
participants
could
experience
physical
discomfort
during
this
aspect
of
training.
If
a
participant
feels
discomfort,
he
or
she
will
be
encouraged
to
engage
in
a
less
straining
manner .
If
discomfort
continues,
then
the
participant
will
be
asked
to
sit
out
of
this
brief
element
of
training
and
discuss
the
areas
of
discomfort
with
their
PCP
before
return
to
practice
of
physical
postures.
Severe
discomfort
is
not
expected,
but
could
possibly
occur .
In
this
case,
the
participant
will
be
treated
for
this
pain,
and
encouraged
to
return
to
practice
stationary
forms
of
mindfulness.
If
a
participant
gets
hurt
or
get
sick
as
a
direct
result
of
being
in
this
study ,
emer gency
treatment
will
be
given
to
them.
All
needed
emer gency
care
is
available
to
participants,
just
as
it
is
to
the
general
public.

Feelings
of
embarrassment
or
anxiety
when
asked
personal
survey
question.
Some
survey
questions
are
of
a
sensitive
or
personal
nature
and
may
cause
the
participant
to
become
upset.
In
some
rare
cases,
participants
may
require
mental
health
support
upon
feeling
upset
by
[CONTACT_601975].
A

The
PI,
M-ROCC
Clinical
Director ,
and
CMC
medical
director
will
remain
available
to
field
questions
from
participants
about
their
experience
with
mindfulness
and
any
adverse
experiences.
The
clinical
director
will
help
to
monitor
participants
and
work
with
the
referring
clinician
to
coordinate
behavioral
health
care
for
participants.
7.
Monitoring
may
lead
to
anxiety
and
difficulty
with
completion
of
interviews
may
lead
to
feelings
of
guilt
or
shame.
Staff
will
specifically
be
trained
not
to
shame
anyone
about
missed
sessions,
but
instead
focus
on
what
they
can
do
to
complete
the

Monitoring
Plan
(DSMP)
was

assigned.
Please
see
appendix
at
the
end
of
this
document.
Adverse
event
reporting
guidelines
are
detailed
in
the
DSMP
and
copi[INVESTIGATOR_601834] .
Definition:
In
this
study
we
will
use
the
FDA
definition
of
adverse
events
(AEs):
“any
untoward
medical
occurrence
that
may
present
itself
during
treatment
or
administration
with
a
pharmaceutical
product
[or
group-based
treatment
intervention],
and
which
may
or
may
not
have
a
causal
relationship
with
the
treatment.”
Serious
adverse
events
for
this
trial
will
be
defined
as
any
AE
temporally
associated
with
the
participants’
involvement
in
research
that
meets
any
of
the
following
criteria:
●
Results
in
death;
●
Is
life-threatening
(i.e.,
any
suicide
attempt
requiring
emer gency
department
or
inpatient
care
will
be
a
SAE,
but
parasuicidal
gestures
or
self-harm
that
is
not
life-threatening
or
requiring
immediate
medical
care
will
be
an
AE,
but
NOT
a
SAE;
any

a
SAE);
●
Inpatient

(other
than
admissions
for

disorder ,
which
will
be
classified
as
an
AE,
but
this
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
classify
as
an
SAE
since
this
may
be
for
detoxification
or
as
a

●
Results
in

●
Based
upon
appropriate
medical
judgement
may
jeopardize
the
participant’ s
health
and
may
require
medical
or
surgical
intervention
to
prevent
one
of
the
outcomes
listed
in
this
definition.
Classification
of
AE
Severity:
AEs
will
be
labeled
according
to
severity ,
which
is
based
on
their
impact
on
the
participants.
An
AE
will
be
termed
“mild”
if
it
does
not
have
a
major
impact
on
the
participant,
“moderate”
if
it
causes
the
participant
some
minor
inconvenience,
and
“severe”
if
it
causes
a
substantial
disruption
to
the
participant’ s
well-being.
Of
note,
a
severe
AE
and
a
serious
adverse
event
(SAE)
are
distinct
terms.
A
participant
could
experience
a
severe
AE
that
does
not
meet
the
above-listed
definition
of
an
SAE;
alternatively ,
a
participant
could
experience
a
moderate
AE
that
meets
the
SAE
definition.
AE
Attribution
Scale:
AEs
will
be
categorized
according
to
the
likelihood
that
they
are
related
to
the
study
intervention.
Specifically ,
they
will
be
labeled
unrelated,
possibly
related,
or
definitely
related
to
the
study
intervention.

a
rate
of
approximately
30

it

Questionnair e
(BEAQ)
262
:
The
62-item
Multidimensional
Experiential
Avoidance
Questionnaire
(MEAQ)
was
recently
developed
to
assess
a
broad
range
of
experiential
avoidance
(EA)
content.
However ,
practical
clinical
and
research
considerations
made
a
briefer
measure
of
EA
desirable.
Using
items
from
the
original
62-item
MEAQ,
a
15-item
scale
(BEAQ)
was
created
that
tapped
content
from
each
of
the
MEAQ’ s
six
dimensions.
Items
were
selected
on
the
basis
of
their
performance
in
3
samples:
under graduates
(n
=
363),
psychiatric
outpatients
(n
=
265),
and
community
adults
(n
=
215).
These
items
were
then
evaluated
using
2
additional
samples
(314
under graduates
and
201
psychiatric
outpatients)
and
cross-validated
in
2
new,
independent
samples
(283
under graduates
and
295
community
adults).
The
resulting
measure
(Brief
Experiential
Avoidance
Questionnaire;
BEAQ)
demonstrated
good
internal
consistency .
It
also
exhibited
strong
conver gence
with
respect
to
each
of
the
MEAQ’ s
6
dimensions.
The
BEAQ
demonstrated
expected
associations
with
measures

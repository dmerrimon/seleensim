Version A.6 – May 4, 2021  4 2 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Study Objective    
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the use of low-
energy segment removal with a micro -interventional irrigation/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_565135] (MICOR- 304) to 
evacuate the lens prior to intraocular lens insertion in subjects undergoing routine cataract 
surgery.  
 
Study Population  
Only [ADDRESS_742196] will be enrolled into the study. Up to 100 subjects (100 eyes) will be 
enrolled into the first phase of the study and an additional 200 subjects (200 eyes) will be 
enrolled in the second phase of the study, for a total of 300 subjects (300 eyes). Subjects will 
be enrolled in one of the two cohorts of this clinical investigation. For the first 100 eyes enrolled – up to 75 eyes may be enrolled in Cohort 1 and up to 75 eyes in Cohort 2. For the 
additional second phase of 200 eyes – up 150 eyes may be enrolled in Cohort 1 and up to 
150 eyes in Cohort 2. Overall, for the 300- study eye investigation, there should be no more 
than 225 eyes in either Cohort 1 or 2.   
 
Study Design    
This is m ulticenter, multi- cohort, prospective clinical study  designed to provide longitudinal, 
observational, non- comparative clinical outcome data for mechanical non- phacoemulsification 
lens extraction using low- energy segment removal with a micro -interventional 
irrigation/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_565135] (MICOR- 304) to evacuate the lens prior to intraocular lens insertion.   
 Subjects will be stratified into two Cohorts.  Cohort 1 is comprise d of eyes  with mild -to- 
moderate cataracts only (Grade 1  to 2).   Cohort 2 is comprised of eyes with moderate to 
more dense cataracts only (Grade 2+ to 3+) .  
 
Inclusion Criteria   
1. Able to understand study requirements, willing to follow study instructions and willing to return for required study follow- up visits . 
2. Willing and able to understand and complete the informed consent document  
3. Subjects with a cataract grade of 1 to 3+ and are  scheduled to undergo cataract 
surgery  
4. Subjects > 18 years of age

of the study  
 
Primary Endpoint  
Efficacy: Total lens removal time and amount of irrigation solution fluid volume used during the 
surgical procedure.    
• Total lens removal time is defined in two phases:  
o The beginning time starts when the sur geon enters into the eye with the 
MICOR -304 to start the lens removal process and completing when the 
surgeon finishes the nucleus lens removal with the MICOR -304 before 
changing over to irrigation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
o The second phase of lens removal time is the irrigation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_565136].  
• Total irrigation solution volume will be recorded using the indicators on the waste bag 
which will have labels that have pre -defined markers to indicate milliliters  (ml) of 
volume of irrigation solution used for the surgical procedure.    
Safety: Rate of occurrence of intraoperative and postoperative adverse events (AEs) 
Secondary Endpoints  
• UCVA on day 1  
• BCVA on days  7, 30 
• Change in corneal thickness  from baseline through Day 30  
• Rate of occurrence of  intraoperative and postoperative adverse events  (AE) 
• Results of slit lamp  and fundus examinations, which are not considered to be AEs  
PROTOCOL MICOR- 304-101 
 
Version A.6 – May 4, 2021  6 • Total procedure time : defined as  the beginning time when the surgeon makes the first 
incision in the eye and completion time is  when the eye speculum is removed at the end of 
the procedure.

Version A.6 – May 4, [ADDRESS_742198] prevalence.  
Approximately 25% of people aged 65- [ADDRESS_742199] cataracts, a proportion increasing to 
over 68% of those aged 80+ years.[ADDRESS_742200] surgeries were performed worldwide; of these, over 3.[ADDRESS_742201] extraction with 
intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the 
world. The safety and effectiveness outcomes of modern -day cataract surgery are well 
described in the literature.[ADDRESS_742202] surgery so that 
now over 99% are performed on an outpatient basis with excellent surgical outcomes.[ADDRESS_742203] surgery has become minimally invasive and more procedural in nature, it has been performed much earlier in the course of disease and patients’ lives. It is not uncommon to perform cataract surgery in the patient’s 5
th decade rather than their 70’s even at very low 
levels of visual impairment. This early intervention has placed additional emphasis on safety and reduced ocular trauma during cataract surgery.  
 Current phacoemulsification approach to cataract extraction involves  high-frequency 
thermogenic ultrasonic needle to fragment the lens and remove it from the anterior segment of 
the eye. This can be associated with significant ocular morbidity particularly in advanced cataracts because the phacoemulsification needle produces significant amount of energy and generates heat which is detrimental  to the cornea and the endothelium. 
 
Mechanical  approaches to lens fragmentation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_565137] -304 
fragmentation and lens removal provide an alternative to phacoemulsification with no 
cavitation, no thermogenic energy in the eye which can eliminate  the generation of heat inside 
the eye while at the same time maintaining the same minimally invasive surgical approach 
through a small clear -cornea 2.5 mm incision.

Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_742222], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008   A.  INTRODUCTION  
1.  The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including 
research on identifiable human material and data. The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
 2.  Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
 3.  It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience 
are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
 
4.  The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”  
PROTOCOL MICOR- 304-101 
 
Version A.6 – May 4, [ADDRESS_742223] take precedence over all other interests.  
 7.  The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
 8.  In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and  
 burdens.  
 9.  Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly 
vulnerable and need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse 
consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence.  
 10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH 
 
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, 
dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects.  
 
PROTOCOL MICOR- 304-101 
 
Version A.6 – May 4, [ADDRESS_742224], incentives for subjects and 
provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as  a consequence 
of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -
study access by [CONTACT_565145].  
 15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must t ake 
into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for res earch 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious AEs. No change to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. 
 16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_565146]. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects

PROTOCOL MICOR- 304-101 
 
Version A.6 – May 4, [ADDRESS_742226]’s freely given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed.  
 25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
 
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_30388].  
 27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed 
consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is  intended to 
promote the health of the population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
 28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition 
PROTOCOL MICOR- 304-101 
 
Version A.6 – May 4, [ADDRESS_742227]’s dissent 
should be respected.  
 
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the r esearch 
population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent pr ovided that the 
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders  them unable to give 
informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
 30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication of 
the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest 
should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
 C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH  
MEDICAL CARE  
 31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the 
research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the 
physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not 
adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
 32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
PROTOCOL MICOR- 304-101 
 
Version A.6 – May 4, 2021  32 • The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven 
intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of 
placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo,  or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious 
or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
 33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
 34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient -physician r elationship.  
 35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating 
suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

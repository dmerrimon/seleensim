variability at the N -terminal r egion of M proteins, there have been more than [ADDRESS_474298] group A 
Streptococcal -mediated strep throat and suppurative skin diseases (2). However, some M proteins bind 
collagen and may cause side effects such as acute rheumatic fever in humans through molecular mimicry 
of collagen (3). Emm55, though, has been shown not to bind collagen due to the confo rmational influences 
of flanking sequences (4). In the IFx -Hu2.0 immunotherapeutic, the Emm55 pro tein acts as an immunologic 
priming antigen aimed at attracting the patient’s immune system to tumor cells.  
 
The product being tested in this clinical study, IFx -Hu2.0, is designed to exploit the inherent vulnerability 
of specific differences from patient to patient, lesion to lesion, and cell to cell. Regardless of the degree

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 12 cell activation and T c ell suppression is critically important in determining the outcome of 
immunotherapeutic interventions.  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_378834] 5 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) occur annually in the [LOCATION_002], 
including 80% basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 20% squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and  a few rarer types. 
Annual incidence is increasing by 4% for SCC and 1% for BCC in the [LOCATION_002]. Of solid organ transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 15% to 43% will develop NMSC within 10 years (6). 
Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is a major risk factor, causes mutations in key genes, and explains 
the predilection of NMSC for sun -exposed skin. Hedgehog signaling pathway mutations are involved in 
BCC pathogenesis. p53 Mutations are involved in both SCC and BCC pathogenesis, and in the development 
of actinic keratoses, which are the precursors of SCCs. There are several histopathologic subtypes of each 
NMSC. The more infiltrative or poorly differentiate d variants are more clinically aggressive (e.g., 
morpheaform BCC and spi[INVESTIGATOR_378835]) (6). 
TNM staging classifications exist for most types of NMSC and depend on cli nical characteristics, pathologic 
features, and radiologic evaluation of the primary tumor, adjacent structures, lymph nodes, and viscera. 
BCCs that are large, deep, or infiltrative may be locally aggressive and recurrent, but metastasize only 
rarely (0.00 3% to 0.55%). SCCs have a greater metastatic rate, especially those that are large, deep, or 
poorly differentiated; have perineural invasion; or are located on the lip, ear, temple, cheek, or sites of 
chronic infection, ulceration, or radiation (6). 
Primary treatment for both BCCs and SCCs is surgical. Mohs micrographic surgery is preferred for ill -
defined or aggressive lesions because it allows microscopic control of tumor margins. The 5 -year local 
recurrence rate for primary BCC is 1% for Mohs surgery compared with 5% for other types of surgical 
excision. The 5 -year local recurrence rate for primary cutaneous SCC is 3.1% for Mohs surgery compared 
with 7.9% for non -Moh s modalities. Alternative primary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_378836]. Interferons and inducers of interferons (e.g., imiquimod) are useful in 
selected cases. Hedgehog pathway agents, retinoids, vitamin D3, and inh ibitors of PD -1/PD -L1 and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) are other promising adjunctive and chemopreventive  
modalities (6). 
Unmet Medical Need  
The application of IFx -Hu2.0  in a neoadjuvant setting may support an improvement in current  recurrence 
rates for these cancers.  This could materialize based on the mechanism of action of IFx -Hu2.0  and its 
ability to elicit therapeutically  relevant cellular  and humoral tumor -specific immune responses.  Findings 
from p rior human use of IFx -Hu2.0 in patients with stage III to IV cutaneous melanoma  supports this  
biological outcome.  
Preclinical Pharmacology  
Study # 20151023 – Murine Melanoma Study  
In the preclinical murine melanoma model, no adverse events were reported for single or repeat dosing 
of the drug product. For monotherapy, a statistically significant reduction in tumor weight and tumor area 
as well as a statistically significant increase in per cent survival were observed (treatment vs. control). For 
combination therapy, a statistically significant reduction in tumor area was observed (combination 
therapy vs. monotherapy). In conjunction with T cell infiltration and IFN -γ data for these mice, the  immune 
responses observed were logically consistent with the hypothesized mechanism of action of IFx -Hu2.0.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 14 experiment,  nine exploratory experiments and a biodistribution experiment. In general, B16-F10 
melanoma cells (1x105 cells/100 mcL/mouse) were injected subcutaneously in syngeneic C57BL/6NCrl  
mice to establish tumors. The day of B16 -F10 cell injection was designated Day 0. Approximately seven to 
ten days post injection, animals with palpable tumors (approximately 25 mm2) were randomly divided 
into experimental treatment cohorts. In some experiments, mice were subcutaneously injected with 
3x105 MO5 tumor cells, an OVA -expressing B16 cell line. Vaccination consisted of IFx -Hu2.0 or negative 
vector controls; pAc/empty or pAc/GFP -N1 plasmid DNA similarly complexed with in vivo -jetPEI® 
transfection reagent. A vaccine dose consisted of 20 mcg plasmid DNA in a total volume of  50 mcL. Three 
weekly vaccine doses were administered intralesionally. Studies were also carried out combining IFx -
Hu2.0 vaccine with antibodies targeting the immune response modifiers PD -1, CTLA -4 and 4 -1BB. 
Throughout these studies, tumor growth was meas ured and monitored 2 -3 times per week.  
All the experiments incorporated safety assessments of the mice as part of the continued safety 
monitoring and final safety evaluation. Mice were monitored twice per day by [CONTACT_378852].  This consisted of monitoring for presence of lesions other than at the site of B16 -F10 
injection, adverse changes to the B16 -F10 injection site, other injuries, coat condition, disposition, signs 
of pain, as well as fecal and urine output, according to th e approved IACUC protocol for rodent husbandry 
(University of South [LOCATION_012] Division of Comparative Medicine SOP#400.14 issued 12/03 updated 7/16). 
No adverse findings were reported.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_378837] -Hu2.0 administratio n and assessed potential 
bioactivity. Six of the exploratory experiments assessed bioactivity of IFx -Hu2.0 as a monotherapy and in 
combination with antibodies targeting immune response modifiers. Preliminary mechanism of action 
assays were also performed i n multiple experiments. For the biodistribution study, mice received one 
dose of IFx -Hu2.0 or similarly complexed pAc/empty.  
Bioactivity experiments focused on the effect of IFx -Hu2.0 on animal survival, tumor mass and tumor area. 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], survival of animals vaccinated with IFx -Hu2.0 was compared to animals vaccinated with 
pAc/empty, or pAc/GFP -N1. There was a signif icant difference between treatment groups as assessed by 
[CONTACT_378853] -Cox survival test (p=0.017), with median survival times of 26 days for pAc/empty and 
pAc/GFP -N1 controls, and [ADDRESS_474303], ther e were 
significantly more IFx -Hu2.0 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_378838]/empty control mice (p=0.032) on Day 29, the 
median survival time for the pAc/empty group. For IFx -Hu2.0 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], median survival time had not yet 
been reached by [CONTACT_2006] 29, i.e. more than 50 % of vaccinated mice were still alive. This difference in survival 
translated into a Hazard ratio (Mantel -Haenszel) of 5.7, which translates to a survival rate 5.7 times higher 
than that of pAc/empty recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Two experiments focused on the effect of IFx -Hu2.[ADDRESS_474304] experiment, the mean ± 
standard deviation (SD) tumor mass of mice vaccinated with IFx -Hu2.0 was 315 mg ± 87 mg, while the 
mean ± SD tumor mass of mice treated with pAc/empty was 997 mg ± 335 mg. This approximately 3 -fold 
decrease in tumor mass over 27 days was significant using a heteroscedastic Student’s T -test (p=0.0083). 
In the second experiment evaluating cotreatment with PD-[ADDRESS_474305] , the mean tumor mass of mice 
receiving IFx -Hu2.0 was less than pAc/empty vaccinate d animals after [ADDRESS_474306] of IFx -Hu2.0 vaccination on tumor area over time was assessed in several experiments. In all 
experiments, mean tumor area from mice vaccinated with IFx -Hu2.0 was less than negative c ontrols.  
Another experiment investigated the effects of IFx -Hu2.0 in combination with antibodies targeting the 
immune response modifiers PD -1, 4-1BB, and CTLA -4. The mean tumor area in mice given IFx -Hu2.0 was 
significantly less than the mean tumor area in  mice receiving pAc/empty at Days 18, 21 and 25. Also,

tumor areas on Days 18, 21 and 25 than pAc/empty alone. The same or greater significance was observed 
at the same timepoints for IFx -Hu2.0 with checkpoint inhibition compared to pAc/empty, depending on 
the Antagonist . At Day 25, the mean tumor area in mice treated with IFx -Hu2.[ADDRESS_474307] experiment, statistically significant differences in mean tumor a rea 
were detected at Day 22 between mice receiving pAc/empty compared to mice receiving IFx -Hu2.[ADDRESS_474308] . Furthermore, on Day 25, statistically significant 
differences in mean tumor area were again observed betwee n mice receiving pAc/empty and mice 
receiving IFx -Hu2.[ADDRESS_474309] of 
IFx-Hu2.0 was immune -mediated. TIL isolated from mice were analyzed for CD8 e xpression using flow 
cytometry. There was an approximately 5 - to 6-fold increase in the number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells/mg 
tumor tissue in IFx -Hu2.0 injected mice compared to PBS and pAc/empty injected controls, suggesting the 
anti-tumor activity of IF x-Hu2.0 is T cell -mediated. This was further supported by [CONTACT_378854], which showed increased staining of CD3, CD4 and CD8 in the three 
treatment groups compared to the control group.  
Flow cytometric analyses o f TIL isolated from mice resulted in a mean ± SD of 30.6% ± 5.8% CD8+ PD-1+ T 
cells in IFx -Hu2.0 injected mice. Expression of PD -1 suggests that the anti -tumor activity of IFx -Hu2.0 could 
be further enhanced using a combination therapy with PD -1 targeting antibodies.  
Cytotoxic T cell function was assessed using intracellular staining of TIL for IFN - and CD107a, a marker of 
CD8+ T cell degranulation, upon activation. The level of CD8+ IFN-+ CD107a+ T cells increased in IFx -Hu2.[ADDRESS_474310] , were evaluated for IFN - production using an ELISA. The level of IFN - was significantly higher 
(p=0.047) in the IFx -Hu2. 0 + PD-[ADDRESS_474311]  treatment group compared to pAc/empty treated controls.  
To gain insight into tumor infiltration of immune cells following vaccination, an indirect analysis of antigen 
specific infiltration of tumors was carried out using the OT1 -MO5 exp erimental model. The B16 subline, 
MO5, expresses an ovalbumin peptide in the context of H2Kb. OT-1 T cells express a T cell receptor (TCR) 
that recognizes the ovalbumin peptide. This results in MHC class I -restricted, ovalbumin -specific, CD8+ T 
cells (OT -1 cells), which primarily recognize the ovalbumin peptide when presented by [CONTACT_145155] I. The level of 
OVA TCR -expressing cells in tumors of IFx -Hu2.0 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_378839] (p=0.0018), suggesting a vaccine -induced increase in antigen -specific T cell infiltration. Another 
experiment investigated infiltration of T cells by [CONTACT_378855] T cells in the spleen and tumor. In 
tumors, there was a significant reduction in CD8+ PD-1+ cells from IFx -Hu2.0 treat ed mice compared to 
pAc/empty control mice (p=0.035), which may be due to a vaccine -induced reduction in the number of 
exhausted T cells.

Recently, Bunch et al. published the murine melanoma study (# 20151023) on 18 June 2020 in the Springer 
Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy journal (7). The study was modeled after the murine melanoma 
study conducted by [CONTACT_279131] (8, 9) . Here, addi tional key efficacy insights will be summarized and presented 
from the Bunch et al. manuscript.  
Bunch et al. conclude that treatment with the pAc/emm55 vector drug substance increases T cell tumor 
infiltration and delays tumor growth, while the anti -tumor efficacy of the dug substance is T cell 
dependent and that this anti -tumor efficacy is improved with drug substance + PD -[ADDRESS_474313] 
combination therapy . These conclusions are echoed in the study report and summary found in the IND.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 18 Study # 20170516 – Murine Melanoma Biodistribution Study  
A separate biodistribution murine melanoma study showed that IFx -Hu2.0 injections resulted in high 
levels of pAc/ emm55  expression vector presence and emm55 mRNA expression in injected tumors. It also 
showed substantially lower levels thereof in all non -target (i.e. non -skin) organs tested. No adverse events 
were reported.  
The biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of IFx -Hu2.0 were evaluated in the B16 -
F10/C57BL/6NCrl  melanoma model. Mice initially received an injection of the syngeneic B16 -F10 
melanoma cell line. After tumors were palpable, mice were randomly selected into treatment cohorts to 
receive a single vaccine injection of IFx -Hu2.0 or a similarly complexed negative control vector 
(pAc/empty), which lacks the emm55 coding region (20 mcg  in 50 mcL). Animals were sacrificed and 
tissues were harvested one day post vaccination, which was the expected time of peak detection, and at 
seven and [ADDRESS_474320] -injection, to evaluate clearance of the emm55 transgene from tissues. Genomic 
DNA (gDNA),  RNA and cDNA were prepared from the injected tumor and eight organs at each time point. 
A quantitative PCR assay meeting the sensitivity recommendation of ≤50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_378840]/1 mcg DNA was 
used to measure the absolute level of pAc/emm55 transgene and rel ative levels of emm55 mRNA 
expression normalized to the endogenous control gene glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH).  
To determine the biodistribution pAc/ emm55 , absolute levels of emm55 were measured in injected 
tumors and organs over time and  are reported in copy numbers per µg gDNA. As expected, transgene 
levels were highest in tumor samples one day post vaccination, with a maximum level of 1.16x1010 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
This represents ~7.3% of the copi[INVESTIGATOR_378841]. Although the transgene was detected in gDNA prepared 
from all organs, the absolute level was approximately [ADDRESS_474321] injection, the transgene was detected at 
2-4 orders of magnitude lower than in tumor.  
To determine the kinetics of transgen e expression, normalization was used to compare relative levels over 
time in each tissue. Normalized levels of emm55 mRNA in tumor (9.8910-01), kidney (9.01x10-05) and lung 
(5.82x10-04) peaked at one day post injection. In lymph node and spleen, peak level s were similar at days 
one and seven post injection relative to the SD of these samples. In liver, peak levels were detected at 
seven days post injection. In heart, peak levels were detected and [ADDRESS_474322] injection. Expression in 
brain and ovaries was u niform over time relative to SD. In addition to transgene biodistribution and 
expression kinetics, all animals involved in this study were monitored for vaccine -related adverse 
reactions.  
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that intralesional injection of IFx -Hu2.0 resulted in high levels of 
emm55 transgene uptake and mRNA expression in tumors with substantially lower levels in other organs 
in which it was detected. These residual levels did not result in any adverse events in the study animals.

The primary outcome was safety. The primary outcome measure was the number of Grade 3  to 5, 
treatment -related adverse events per CTCAE 5.0.  This study accrued 6/6 evaluable patients. At the 
conclusi on of the trial, no patient experienced any grade 3 to 5 treatment -related adverse events. One 
patient received injections at multiple time points. More than one patient had more than one lesion 
injected at a given timepoint.  
Clinical data available to dat e (i.e. , tumor tissue biopsies and blood sample analysis) is presented below 
from 3 of the 6 evaluable patients (P1, P3, and P4). Tumor biopsies were analyzed via fluorescent multi -
color immunohistochemistry (mIHC) staining.  
This interim cellular analysis indicates that:  
1. all patients (3/3 patients) experienced a significant decrease in SOX10+ melanoma cells 
indicating melanoma cell death within the target lesion, and  
2. all patients (3/3 patients) experienced a decrease in FOXP3/CD8+ regulatory T cell s mediating 
immunosuppression correlating with an improved overall prognosis (i.e. , an increased likelihood 
of a clinical immune response), and  
3. P1 and P4 (2/3 patients) experienced hypocellularity indicating cell death within the target 
lesion.  
Clinically,  P1 went on to receive nivolumab monotherapy (PFS of 19 months and SD), P3 went on to receive 
talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy (PFS of 12 months and SD), and P4 went on to receive 
nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976] (PFS of 12 months and PR). The study intervention exhibited 
a strong safety profile with no Grade 3 to 5 treatment -related adverse events per CTCAE v5.0.

were enrolled and treated, and six patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint. There was one 
screen failure and one death unlikely related to the study drug as determined by [CONTACT_458]. 
The primary outcome measure of this trial was the rate of DLTs defined as the rate of grade 3 to 5 
treatment -related adverse events (AEs) that were deemed  unacceptable toxicities by [CONTACT_1961]. No grade 3 to 5 treatment -related adverse events (AE) per CTCAE v5.0 were reported (Grade

OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  
Primary  
Safety; i.e., to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
feasibility of treatment with IFx -Hu2.[ADDRESS_474331] current version of Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).  
 
Feasibility will be defined as the ability to treat at least 80 of 
the approximately 100 patients enrolled without dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Secondary  
To assess post -therapeutic  pathological response at 
four weeks post -treatment.  The secondary endpoint is Pathological Response defined as a 
response assessment to IFx -Hu2.0 in tumor lesions excised by 
[CONTACT_378859] (%RVT), at four weeks as :

• partial pathological response (pPR) , or  
• pathological non -response (pNR)    
Tertiary/Exploratory  
To assess anti -tumor immunity post -treatment.  Patient samples (plasma and/or serum) will be assayed to 
detect tumor antigen specific antibody generation in 
addition to a protein biomarker discovery assay specific to 
immuno -oncology therapy assessments.  
 
IHC will be performed on pre - and post -treatment tissue 
samples to contrast the cell sub -types across time points.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 23 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
This is a multi -site, -open label , interventional, prospective, phase 1 trial to assess safety and tolerability 
of IFx -Hu2.0 in patients with basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma . 
 
A total of  approximately  one hundred (100) male and/or female adult patients (greater than or equal to 
18 years old), of any ethnicity and race, with at least one cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or basal 
cell carcinoma lesion accessible for direct injection, who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, will 
be eligible for enrollment and treatment with IFx -Hu2.0.  
 
Enrollees will receive IFx -Hu2.0 as a single intralesional injection at a single time point. The target dose 
will be 100 μg of plasmid DNA per lesion injected at a final dose volume of 200 μL per lesion. The injected 
lesion will be completely excised at the follow -up visit four weeks later, and will be  biops ied for 
confirmation of diagnosis and for the establishment of a pathological response baseline Peripheral blood 
will be collected from these patients prior to treatment administration and at the follow -up visit four 
weeks later. These samples will be used to perform complete blood counts (CBC) and clinical chemistry 
tests. A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis  for protein and blood at the same frequency. Blood 
samples will be drawn for immune response evaluation as well.  
4.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE  
IFx-Hu2.0 is composed of pAc/ emm55  (plasmid DNA (pDNA)) complexed with in vivo -jetPEI® (linear 
polyethylenimine), a  transfection reagent, and dextrose, a complex stabilizer. The ionic balance within the 
in vivo -jetPEI®/pDNA complexes is crucial. For effective cell entry, the complexes should be cationic. The 
N/P ratio is a measure of the ionic balance within the comple xes and is defined as the number of Nitrogen 
residues of in vivo -jetPEI® per nucleic acid Phosphate. Approximately one in three nitrogen atoms within 
the in vivo -jetPEI® molecule is cationic. Therefore, electroneutrality of in vivo -jetPEI®/pDNA complexes is 
reached at an N/P ratio > 2 to 3. in vivo -jetPEI® is provided as a 150 mM solution (expressed as nitrogen 
residues). Given that 1 mcg of nucleic acid contains 3 nmoles of anionic phosphate, the amount of in vivo -
jetPEI® to be mix ed with pDNA in order to obtain a specific N/P ratio is calculated using the following 
formula:  
 
 
 
The N/P ratio of 6 has been optimized for in vitro  delivery of IFx -Hu2.0. This is the N/P ratio used for the 
preparation of clinical doses of IFx -Hu2.0.

than those expressly mentioned below without consulting the treating physician.  
2. Abstain from caffeine - or xanthine -containing products (e .g., coffee, tea, cola drinks, and choc olate 
for 6 hours before receiving IFx -Hu2.0  
3. Abstain from alcohol for 24 hours before receiving IFx -Hu2.0  
4. Participants who use tobacco products will be instructed that use of nicotine -containing products 
(including nicotine patches) will not be permitted w hile they are in the clinical unit.  
5. Abstain from strenuous exercise for 24 hours before each blood collection for clinical laboratory 
tests. Participants may participate in light recreational activities during participation in the stud y 
(e.g., watching television, reading).  
6. Minimize interactions with household contacts who may b e immunocompromised . 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transpare nt reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes demography, screen failure details, el igibility criteria, and any serious adverse event 
(SAE).

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 26 Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) may be rescreened. 
Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.  
5.[ADDRESS_474345] to  follow -up or withdraw 
consent.  
 
Potential participants will be identified by [CONTACT_378860], available recruitment 
databases, and other methods available to participating sites to identify potential participants. Specific 
recruitment ma terials  may be developed by [CONTACT_456] .   In addition , if any site decides to utilize 
participant -focused materials for recruitment, such materials and a usage plan will be submitted for IRB 
review and approval prior to implementation. A clinical enrollment manager (CEM) or sponsor designee(s) 
may locally support the research team and facilitate patient recruitment at the study site in addition to 
all other measures/efforts.  Under no circumstance will referral fees, incentives, or bonuses to physi cians 
for recruitment be allowed.  
 
There is no specific plan to target participants based on race, gender, or age. All eligible potential 
participants will be approached for inclusion.  
 
It is anticipated that recruitment will take up to 12 months to comple te at approximately five research 
sites.  Sites will be NCI -designated cancer centers, academic medical centers, clinics,  and doctor’s offices 
within the [LOCATION_002] . Sites can include community facilities as a primary site or a satellite site of a 
parti cipating center as long as they meet the requirements regarding the proper handling and 
administration of the investigational agent.   
 
Due to the size and short duration of the study, there is no planned retention or compensation plan for 
participants.  T hroughout the study, participants will be reminded about upcoming visits and the 
procedures to be performed at the visit.  New information that surfaces during the study will be 
communicated to participants through IRB -approved mechanisms.  
 
In alignment wi th the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [ADDRESS_474346] Mileage Rate (Notice 2020 -05), 
participants can be reimbursed at a rate of 17 cents per mile driven in an automobile for traveling for 
study -related medical purposes. This will be done approximately one m onth after travel receipts are 
submitted by [CONTACT_378861].

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION  
 
pAc/ emm55 , the drug substance (also known as the active pharmaceutical ingredient), is a r ecombinant 
plasmid expression vector containing the Streptococcus pyogenes  serotype M55 (Isolate A928171 ) 
modified cell surface M virulence protein as an antigen . The plasmid backbone is derived from the Takara 
Bio s table, constitutive, nonviral, mammalian expression vector pAcGFP1 -N1. pAc/ emm55  is expressed in 
Escherichia coli  (Thermo Fischer Scientific  Invitrogen™ One Shot™ Stbl3™  (derived from HB101) ). 
6.1.[ADDRESS_474347] 
be administered within 4 hours of constitution (see Investigator’s Brochure section 3.3).  
 
IFx-Hu2.0 is intended for intralesional (i.e. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or lymph nodal) injection. All 
participants will b e monitored for [ADDRESS_474348] abstain from caffeine - or xanthine -containing products (e.g., coffee, tea, cola drinks, 
and chocolate ) for [ADDRESS_474349] evenly throughout the lesion on multiple tracks,  pulling the needle back after injecting a 
portion of the drug without withdrawing it from the lesion, then rotating it radially on another track 
until the entire lesion is treated. If the lesion is resistant to drug injection, apply slow, steady 
pressure,  moving the needle slightly as needed. Local anesthetic should not be injected into the 
lesion  or the surrounding tissue , since it may alter pH and therefore drug stability.  
4. Withdraw the needle slowly to reduce the risk of drug leakage.  
5. Clean the injection site and surrounding area with an alcohol pad.  
 
A single dose (0.1mg) will be used in this trial and at a single timepoint, therefore no dose escalation or 
reduction is proposed.  
6.1.3 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE  
 
Participant engagement will in volve a screening period, baseline visit, and follow -up/final study visit for a 
total of three visits.  The total duration of participation for each individual  participant is expected to be 
approximately six weeks.   A snapshot of the study schedule of eve nts can be found in section 1.3.

8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.2.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  (21 CFR 312.32(A))  
 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
An ongoing or intermittent adverse event should be recorded only once, with the highest/worst grade 
reported for the event. This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 
5 (CTCAE v5) for toxicity and adverse event reporting.  
8.2.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  (21 CFR 312.32(A))  
 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect  in the offspring of a participant . Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may req uire medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions tha t do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.

Protocol SC 2020 -01 02 Jun 2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 35 8.2.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines wil l be used to 
describe severity:  
1. Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
2. Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
3. Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_378866] d evaluates the participant based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
1. Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention  administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
study intervention  (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically 
or phenomenologically definiti ve., with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
2. Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occ urs within a 
reasonable time after  administration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information i s not required to fulfill this definition.  
3. Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other 
factors may have contr ibuted to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can 
be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related”  or “definitely 
related”, as appropriate.  
4. Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention  administration makes a causal relationship improbable 
(e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
intervention ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible 
explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).

Protocol SC 2020 -01 02 Jun 2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017 -04-07 36 5. Not R elated  – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention  administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, 
definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTE DNESS  
 
The medical monitor  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE 
will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the curr ent Investigator Brochure for IFx -Hu 2.0.  
8.2.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will b e captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_10263] a  diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring 
while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be consi dered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the a pre -existing  condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE , with use of descriptors in the AE term to designate that it is 
a pre -existing condition (e.g., w orsening of or exacerbation of)  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed.  
 
The investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurri ng any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study 
participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the 
last visit. Events wi ll be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
8.2.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
Adverse events will be documented.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_378845].  The medical monitor will review all adverse event 
reports and ensure that participants are receiving appropriate clinical care and identify any potential 
safety concerns.  The medical monitor will assess the information provided to determine the re latedness 
of the event to the study intervention as well as propose any changes to the protocol and/or consent form 
based on the event.  All adverse events will be documented and reported to the FDA in the annual report.  
Adverse events that meet the requi rements for reporting to the IRB will be reported within the guidelines 
required by [CONTACT_60683], along with necessary supporting information and revised trial 
documentation, as necessary.

that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -
cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a 
causal relati onship between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis).  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator 
deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable . Other supporting documentation of the event 
may be requested by [CONTACT_8704].  
 
The medical monitor will review all adverse event reports and ensure that participants are receiving 
appropriate clinical care and identify any potential safety concerns.  The medical monitor will assess the 
information provided to determine the relatedness of the event to the study intervention as well as 
propose any changes to the protocol and/or consent form based on the event.  The study sponsor will be 
responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any unexpected  fatal or life -
threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after 
the sponsor 's initial re ceipt of the information. In addition, the sponsor must notify FDA and all 
participating investigators in an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of potential serious risks, 
from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no c ase later than 15 calendar days after 
the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
8.2.7 REPORTING OF EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
Changes in the risk profile and/or risk/benefit ratio from observed adverse and/or serious adverse events 
will be communicated to participants through an IRB -approved revised consent form or addendum, as 
deemed appropriate given the information to be provi ded. If re -consent of the participants is required for 
continued participation, it must be obtained prior to continuing study related procedures.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_474358] they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation.  
All investigators are required to report any pregnancy that occurs during the study within [ADDRESS_474359] to the 
Sponsor’s safety vendor Drug Safety Navigator ( DSN ). 
The investigator is not obligated to actively seek pregnancy information in former study participants, but 
if the in vestigator learns of a pregnancy through spontaneous reporting, a Pregnancy Report Form must 
be completed and faxed to DSN.

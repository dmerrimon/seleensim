**  See Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_307837] used conventional radiation doses.  The NSABP (R03) and the Gastrointestinal Intergroup (INT0147) each designed a randomized trial of preoperative versus 
postoperative combined modality therapy for resectable rectal cancer in an effort to employ 
conventional radiation dosing, to determine whether preoperative chemotherapy and radiation improves disease- free and overall survival compared to postoperative therapy, and to evaluate 
local recurrence rates, sphincter preservation, down staging, and quality of life.  Unfortunately, both trials were terminated prior to completion because of inadequate patient accrual.  The 
NSABP has reported on the status of the 267 patients randomized with data one year after 
randomization, suggesting similar disease- free survival (83% versus 78%, p=0.29) with similar 
postoperative complications, although a larger proportion of preoperative patients had sphi ncter -
saving surgery (1).  Grade 4- 5 toxicity was greater in the preoperative arm (34% versus 23%, 
p=0.07).  It is evident that both pre- and postoperative strategies have been embraced in the 
[LOCATION_002], and it remains likely that a preoperative versus  postoperative trial will never be 
completed with sufficient numbers of patients.  Both approaches are now viewed as acceptable 
alternatives de facto.  
The predominant chemotherapy regimens for rectal cancer patients include 5- FU, with or without 
leucovorin, and protracted venous infusion 5- FU.  There also is interest in substituting oral 5- FU 
regimens for protracted venous infusion 5- FU.  The first intergroup rectal trial (NCCTG 86- 47-51) 
showed that protracted venous infusion of 5- FU during pelvic irradiation administered in the 
postoperative setting increased the time to relapse and improved survival compared to those treated with bolus 5- FU(2).  Results from the second intergroup trial (INT0114), with a median 
follow -up of survivors at 7.[ADDRESS_307838] that overall and disease- free survival are not 
statistically different among the four treatment groups.  All patients received two cycles of 5- FU-
based chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_253090] 5- FU and two additional cycles of 
chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy was bolus 5- FU, 5- FU and leucovorin, 5- FU and levamisole, and 
5-FU, leucovorin, and levamisole (3- 5).  The data do suggest that local recurrence is significantly 
less for lower risk patients (T
1-2 N+ T3N0) compared to high risk (T 3 N+ T4 Nany) with ov erall survival 
and disease- free survival favoring the lower -risk group.  Males also had a poorer outcome.

[ADDRESS_307839] intergroup trial (INT0144) is a three- arm, postoperative evaluation of 5- FU by [CONTACT_253091] 5- FU by [CONTACT_253092] 5- FU plus leucovorin plus levamisole prior to 
and following combined pelvic radiation.  The study reached its accrual goal in August [ADDRESS_307840] suggested that a regimen of irinotecan, 5-FU, and leucovorin is superior to 5- FU and leucovorin (6 -7).  The intergroup adjuvant colon trial 
(INT0089) has confirmed that 5- FU and leucovorin is the favored regimen (8- 13).  The recently 
completed colon intergroup adjuvant trial (C89803) compares irinotecan, 5- FU, and leucovorin 
versus 5- FU and leucovorin. The results are pending.  The survival advantage of irinotecan, 5- FU, 
and leucovorin in the advanced disease setting justifies further evaluation of the combination, not only in the adjuvant setting for colon cancer but also for rectal cancer patients.  There are limited data describing the use of post -radiation irinotecan, 5- FU and leucovorin for resected rectal cancer 
patients.  In a study of [ADDRESS_307841] -surgery weekl y irinotecan, 5-
FU and leucovorin for four weeks repeated every six weeks for three cycles, there was no evidence of grade 4 neutropenia or other grade 3- 4 non- hematologic toxicities (14).  Recent 
morbidity and mortality data from advanced disease trials and the intergroup protocol (C89803) suggest that the bolus regimen of irinotecan, 5- FU and leucovorin produces a level of toxicity 
which would warrant dose reductions or alternative schedules (6,15).  An alternative schedule includes infusion regimens of 5- FU combined with irinotecan which have been widely employed in 
Europe and approved by [CONTACT_2165] (7).  A recent report of infusion regimens of 5- FU with irinotecan suggest a median survival of greater than 20 months for 
advanced colorectal cancer patients with acceptable toxicity (16).   
Oxaliplatin (trans -l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum) is a novel antineoplastic platinum 
derivative with a 1,2- diaminocyclohexane [DACH] carrier ligand.  Although the precise mechanism 
of action is unknown, platinum compounds are thought to exert their cytotoxic effects through the formation of DNA adducts that block both DNA replication and transcription. Like cisplatin, oxaliplatin reacts with DNA, forming mainly platinated intra- strand links with two adjacent guanines 
or a guanine adjacent to an adenine (17- 19).  However, DACH- platinum adducts formed by 
[CONTACT_253093] (19,20) and are more cytotoxic than cis -diammine- platinum adducts formed from cisplatin and carboplatin (19- 21). 
The safety profile of oxaliplatin was evaluated in a phase I intra- patient escalation study of 44 
patients with advanced cancer, who received 116 courses of oxaliplatin through seven levels, from 45 mg/m² to 200 mg/m² every four weeks (22).  Oxaliplatin was administered without pre-hydration or post -hydration.  Initially, all patients experienced nausea and vomiting.  As a result, 
systematic pretreatment with antiemetics was given to all patients receiving >90 mg/m² oxaliplatin, 
which reduced Grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting to 11%.  Diarrhea was mild (primarily Grade 1 
or 2 in 24% of therapy courses).  Hematologic toxicity was moderate.  Grade 1 or 2 
thrombocytopenia was dose related and occurred in 13% of patients receiving from 135 to 150 mg/m², and 28.5% of patients receiving from 175 to 200 mg/m².  Similarly, only Grade [ADDRESS_307842] of oxaliplatin therapy was a transient peripheral neuropathy.  This toxicity usually appeared 
at doses >90 mg/m² and affected up to 75% of patients treated with 200 mg/m².  The 
recommended phase II dose was 135 mg/m² administered over at least 1 hour every four weeks.  
A review of several studies to evaluate overall safety in 682 patients who had received oxaliplatin either as a single agent or in combination with 5- FU was done to delineate the character and 
severity of oxaliplatin- induced neurotoxicity (23).  Grade 3 neurotoxicity presenting as fine 
movement disturbance or moderate sensitive ataxia was observed in 12% of patients at a median 
cumulative dose of 900 mg/m² oxaliplatin.  (Total cumulative doses of 780, 1170, and 1560 mg/m² 
were correlated with an incidence of 10%, 50% and 75% neurotoxicity, respectively.)  The total cumulative dose of oxaliplatin was the most significant prognostic factor for the occurrence of neurotoxicity and inversely related to the likelihood of recovery from toxicity.  Symptoms resulting

3 from Grade 1 and 2 neuropathy regressed in 82% of patients within 4 to 6 months, and 
disappeared entirely in 41% of patients within [ADDRESS_307843] patients.  
The efficacy of oxaliplatin monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer was evaluated in five phase II trials, two with 63 previously untreated patients and three with 139 patients w ith 
metastatic disease previously treated with and mostly refractory to 5- FU (23 -27).  The objective 
response rate achieved with oxaliplatin as first -line therapy was approximately 20% while that of 
oxaliplatin as second- line therapy was approximately 10%.  
Two randomized studies have compared the combination of oxaliplatin, 5- FU, and leucovorin to 5-
FU and leucovorin alone as initial therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.  In one trial oxaliplatin was administered at 125 mg/m² every three weeks with dail y x 5 5 -FU plus leucovorin, and in the 
other oxaliplatin was administered at 85 mg/m² every two weeks with infusional 5- FU/ leucovorin 
on days 1- 2 (28, 29).  Both studies showed improved time to progression (q 2 weeks: 9.0 vs. 6.2 
months, p=0.0003; q 3 weeks: 8.7 vs. 6.1 months, p=0.048) and response rates (q 2 weeks: 
50.7% vs. 22.3%, p=0.0001; q 3 weeks 53% vs. 16% p<0.001) in the oxaliplatin arms.  Although a 
trend in favor of oxaliplatin was reported, there was no statistically significant difference in overall 
survival between the arms.  
In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of regimens based on the following combinations:  5-FU+ leucovorin + irinotecan; 5- FU+ leucovorin + oxaliplatin; oxaliplatin + irinotecan, in newly 
diagnosed patients with advanced (metastatic) colorectal cancer an intergroup study, N9741, 
(NCCTG, ECOG, CALGB, NCIC- CTG, SWOG) was initiated. Initially, this was a 6 -arm study. 
However, 3 arms (those administering 5- FU for 4 or 5 consecutive days) were discontinued early 
because of  inferior efficacy or excessive toxicity. Recently, preliminary results of a planned interim 
analysis of the 3 remaining arms were released by [CONTACT_29630]. The analysis, 
based on 795 patients enrolled in the study between March 1999 and April 2001, showed that 
patients receiving the infusional regimen (oxaliplatin with infusional 5- FU and leucovorin) had 
significantly longer time to disease progression (8.8 months vs 6.9 months; p = 0.0009), 
significantly better overall survival (18.6 months vs 14.1 months; p = 0.002) , a significantly higher response rate (38% vs 29%; p = 0.03) and lower toxicity than patients receiving irinotecan, with bolus 5- FU and leucovorin (IFL) (30, 31).  
Various modifications of the combination of oxaliplatin with 5- FU/leucovorin regimens (FOLFOX 1-
FOLFOX 6) have been evaluated (30- 34). The more recent modifications have simplified the 
schedule of administration and improved patient convenience without compromising the efficacy of the regimen. Maindrault -Goebel et al. reported on a Phase II study of oxaliplatin (100 mg/m
2) 
and leucovorin (400 mg/m2) as a 2- hour infusion on Day 1 followed by [INVESTIGATOR_123932] (400 mg/m2) and a 
46-hour infusion (2.4- 3 g/m2) of 5- FU every 2 weeks (FOLFOX 6) as second line treatment for 
metastatic colorectal cancer (35). Sixteen of 60 patients treated had a partial response (27%) and 
an additional 45% had stable disease. Median progression- free survival was 5.3 months and 
median survival was 10.8 months. Ryan et al. evaluated biweekly oxaliplatin in combination with a 
modified de Gramont regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 as a 2- hour infusion on Day 1 of each 2- week 
cycle, immediately followed by [CONTACT_13432], 500 mg/m2 as a 2- hour infusion followed by [CONTACT_253094], 
400 mg/m2 and a 46- hour infusion of 5- FU, total  dose 2.4 mg/m2) in heavily pre- treated patients 
with advanced colorectal cancer. Preliminary data showed a response rate of 7% (36). Updated information reveals a response rate of 11% (5% -22%), all in patients who had received prior 
irinotecan. When only second- line patients are considered, the response rate was 25% (8% -43%).  
1.[ADDRESS_307844] of adjuvant 
treatment on rectal function.  
In a clinical trial of postoperative adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy and bolus 5- fluorouracil f or 
rectal cancer, 35% of the patients experienced $ grade 2 diarrhea (37).  The incidence of  $ grade 
3 diarrhea was 20%. Administration of 5- FU by [CONTACT_253095] a higher rate of 
grade 3 or worse diarrhea than administration by [INVESTIGATOR_123932] (2). In a randomized comparison of these two approaches  to postoperative adjuvant therapy, grade 3 or worse diarrhea was observed in 
24% of patients during radiation therapy who received concurrent 5- FU by [CONTACT_253096] 14% of patients treated with 5- FU by [CONTACT_253097]. A 
number of randomized trials have been conducted in an effort to identify agents that prevent or 
decrease diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy. Three trials have assessed the value of 
salicylate preparations (38- 40). Two studies suggested a beneficial effect (38- 40) and one 
NCCTG study suggested a large harmful effect. Two double blind clinical trials evaluated oral sucralfate (41,42). In one trial, sucralfate was associated with a decrease in diarrhea (41). In the other trial, performed by [CONTACT_253098], sucralfate was not associated with a decrease in diarrhea, 
and some gastrointestinal symptoms were exacerbated by [CONTACT_253099] (42). A trial 
evaluating cholestyramine provided evidence that this agent can decrease diarrhea, but only at the expense of unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects (43). Taken together, evidence from 
these studies indicates that acute diarrhea is a significant clinical problem in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy. These studies also indicate that there is no class of agents that 
consistently  demonstrates the ability to prevent diarrhea in these patients with an acceptable 
toxicity profile.  
Long term adverse effects on rectal function as a result of combined postoperative chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy were studied by [CONTACT_253100] (44). Forty -one patients who had received this treatment were contact[CONTACT_253101], as were [ADDRESS_307845] 
spectrum of 11 different parameters. For example, 46% of the irradiated patients experienced nocturnal bowel movements, compared to only 14% of the non- irradiated patients ( P<0.001). Fifty -
six percent of the irradiated patients experienced at least occasional incontinence, compared to only 7% of non- irradiated patients ( P<0.001). Protective clothing was used by 41% of irradiated 
patients and 10% of non- irradiated patients ( P<0.001).  Because interviewers were not blinded, 
and because the patients were not randomized to receive or not receive pelvic irradiation, the 
results of this study must be interpreted with caution.  
Lundby [CONTACT_253102] 11 years after completion of a randomized clinical trial comparing adjuvant postoperative pelvic radiation therapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions, with a two week break after 30 Gy) with observation (45).  103 of the 494 patients originally entered onto the trial were alive without recurrence at the time of the evaluation.  The study design called 
for patients to be contact[CONTACT_8344] a structured interview regarding their bowel function. Eight patients were excluded because of dementia or deafness.   Two could not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
The remaining 93 patients, 49 in the radiation group and 44 in the control group, were included in the evaluation of rectal function. Individuals interviewing patients were blinded as to the treatment received at the beginning of the interview.  Blinding was maintained in 89% of the interviews. Findings of this study are strikingly similar to those observed in the Mayo Clinic study.  For 
example, 49% of irradiated patients experienced fecal incontinence, compared to only 5% of  
control patients ( P<0.001).  Protective clothing was used by 26% of the irradiated patients 
compared to none of the control patients ( P<0.001).  Because of the randomized nature of the 
original treatment allocation and because of the fact that interviewers, in the vast majority of 
cases, remained blinded as to the treatment received by [CONTACT_13935], it is unlikely that bias can account for these results.  This study, therefore, provides strong corroboration of the Mayo Clinic 
study and indicates that a very high proportion of patients experience clinically significant, long 
term rectal toxicity following postoperative adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy for rectal cancer.

remain primarily concerned with the number of stools per day or use a varied assortment of

Prospective assessment of rectal function will be an integral part of this clinical trial, in view 
of the extensive body of research providing unequivocal evidence of both acute and long term adverse effects on rectal function in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy.  A simple bowel function questionnaire has been developed for assessment of several measures of rectal function, such as stool frequency, continence, “clustering” (the need to 
have a second bowel movement, 30 minutes after defecation), and the ability to defer 
defecation 15 minutes.  The questionnaire is based on the Mayo Clinic study mentioned above, in which bowel function was assessed in a group of patients with resected rectal cancer who either had or had not received adjuvant pelvic RT (44).  As indicated previously, findings from this study suggest that this questionnaire is able to discriminate between 
patients that have received and not received pelvic radiation therapy. For each of the eight 
measures of bowel function addressed by [CONTACT_120266], a highly significant difference 
was noted between the group of patients who had received prior RT and those who had not (44).  Further evidence of the ability of this questionnaire to discriminate between groups of patients may be found in the NCCTG study of sucralfate, whi ch demonstrated statistically 
significant worse outcome in the sucralfate group with regard to fecal incontinence, need for protective clothing, and overall gastrointestinal symptoms (42).  Use of this questionnaire will 
provide more detailed information on long- term bowel function than would be provided by 
[CONTACT_253103].  
The primary construct we are targeting with the questionnaire is problems  with bowel 
function as perceived by [CONTACT_102].  This construct is more relevant and precise than asking 
for a simple incidence measure of various bowel function parameters.  If the patient 
perceives that bowel function is a problem, then it is a problem (46, 53). Hence it is important 
to capture this patient -reported outcome as an indicator of treatment efficacy.  
Face validity of the bowel function questionnaire derives from a content analysis of the 
literature and the framework used in the application of the original questionnaire (44, 50- 60). 
We will carry out further psychometric evaluation of the bowel function questionnaire in this study. 
Specifically, we will assess the reliability and validity of the bowel function questionnaire according 
to standard methods (47) and analogous to specific methodology used to validate a tool for 
measuring constipation in cancer patients (46).  
A function questionnaire with a more general quality -of-life (QOL) measure is known as the 
Uniscale (48).  The Uniscale is a single- item visual analogue tool intended to measure overall 
QOL, which has been used successfully in a number of NCCTG trials. These studies have demonstrated that this global measure of quality of life is reliable and valid, and also has some 
advantages over more complex instruments (49).  Discriminant validity will be examined by 
[CONTACT_253104].  
We will also use the FACT Diarrhea Subscale, a subscale of FACT -G, to assess bowel function in 
this study. The FACT Diarrhea Subscale is a simple eleven item instrument which covers a range of problems encountered by [CONTACT_253105]. A key 
difference between the FACT Diarrhea Subscale and the bowel function questionnaire is that the 
FACT Diarrhea Subscale uses a Likert scale, while the bowel function questionnaire uses a dichotomous scale for most questions. A general description of the extensive measures that have been undertaken to validate the FACT quality of life scales has been reported by [CONTACT_253106] (61).  
It generally takes patients less than [ADDRESS_307847] been reported (62- 88), 
but none of the markers has reached routine clinical usage because their value is not proven (89-
91).  As a result of successful clinical trials (92), the current standard of care for rectal cancer patients in stage II and III is pre- or post -operative chemoradiation.  Identification of high- and low -
risk patients within the stage groupi[INVESTIGATOR_253027].  
In addition, predictive markers for response or resistance to chemoradiation have broad implications for treatment of patients with rectal carcinoma.  Therapy results  in morbidity and 
mortality in some patients, and cancer can progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175].  Therefore, markers that predict survival are needed (62).  
The sensitivity and resistance of cancers to chemoradiation are complex characteristics affected by [CONTACT_253107], pharmacokinetics, tumor biology, radiation biology, and tumor cell phenotypes 
and genotypes.  Recent advances in molecular biology have directed attention at genetic 
pathways involved in control of the cell cycle and apoptosis which are affected by [CONTACT_253108] (93- 95).  In vitro studies suggested that the p53 pathway is important:  responses to most 
agents, including anti -metabolites such as 5- FU, the mainstay of chemotherapy for colorectal 
cancer, and radiation, were in large part dependent on w ild-type p53 (96). Cells with abnormal 
mismatch repair showed resistance to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation 
(97-98).  In addition, genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolism of chemotherapeutic 
agents and repair of their DNA adducts may affect drug efficacy and also serve as predictive 
markers for sensitivity and resistance to the agents (123).  Few studies, however, have addressed markers in clinical trials of chemoradiation.  
In patients who undergo resection of a rectal carcinoma with curative intent, it is the presence of 
undetected residual disease which is responsible for recurrence and ultimately death of the patient 
(99).  These occult metastases are the target of pre- operative neoadjuvant and post -operative 
adjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer (100,101).  Patients who have occult metastasis may benefit if the adjuvant chemoradiation is effective, but those patients who lack occult metastasis derive no benefit and are nonetheless subjected to the toxicity of treatment (102).  Ideally, markers for risk -adapted therapy would identify the patients at high risk and low risk, thereby [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_253028].  
Improved prediction of outcome by [CONTACT_253109]- risk minority and the low -risk majority 
of patients would be helpful in both groups of rectal cancer patients to identify appropriate candidates for chemoradiation and those who do not need therapy because of inherently high survival rates.   
[CONTACT_193704]’s laboratory was the first to report that 18q allelic loss was an unfavorable prognostic 
marker in stage II colorectal cancer (103), a finding that was confirmed in numerous subsequent 
studies (62, 65, 71, 73, 75, 78, 79).  In a collaborative study with the ECOG of stage III colon cancer, [CONTACT_193704]’s laboratory reported that retention of chromosome 18q alleles in microsatellite -stable cancers and mutation of the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor 
gene (TGF beta RII) in cancers with high levels of microsatellite instability were favorable markers 
for disease- free and overall survival.  Therefore, we will evaluate the molecular predictive markers 
identified in our and others’ previous studies (chromosome 18q allelic loss, p53 gene mutation and 
microsatellite instability) in order to evaluate the relative strengths of the markers.  
The cooperative groups and others have conducted a series of retrospective trials correlating expression of key targets of 5- FU-based therapy with response to therapy in the adjuvant setting.  
In rectal cancer, a retrospective analysis demonstrated decreased survival for those patients with 
high thymidylate synthetase (TS) expression, although the patients who received the most benefit 
from chemotherapy had high TS expression (104).  Other investigators have confirmed that high

[ADDRESS_307848] tumor downstaging (105, 106). In addition, recent analyses suggest colorectal cancer responding to 5- FU have low gene expression levels of dihydropyrmidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and 
thymidine phosphorylase (TP) (88).  We will evaluate expression of these three enzymes (TS, 
DPD and TP) as potential markers.   
This protocol includes therapy with oxaliplatin in Arm B and Arm E.  Excision repair cross -
complementing 1 (ERCC1), ERCC2 and XPF are enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair, 
and their activity could affect the ability of tumor cells to remove platinum adducts from their DNA and influence the efficacy of the drug.  Colorectal cancer patients with low levels of ERCC1 expression in their tumor have been reported to have improved survival after oxaliplatin therapy 
(123).  We will evaluate expression of these three genes (ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF) as potential 
markers.  
1.4 Gender and Ethnicities Statement  
This study is open to both men and women and to all racial/ethnic groups.  The patient enrollment pattern is expected to be similar to that of typi[INVESTIGATOR_253029].  According to the most recent ECOG experience, there is no evidence for outcome to be affected by [CONTACT_253110].  Thus, the study will not have separate accrual targets for different subgroups.  We will, 
however, conduct subset analyses to assess gender and racial/ethnic effects when possible.  
2. Objectives 
2.1 To compare the overall survival of patients treated with irinotecan, 5- FU and leucovorin versus 
those treated with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5- FU versus those treated with leucovorin and 5- FU 
for patients with stage II and III rectal cancer.  
2.2 Secondary endpoints will include sphincter preservation, tolerance of treatment and patterns of 
failure.  
2.3 To prospectively assess rectal function using the Patient Bowel Function/Uniscale questionnaire 
and the FACT Diarrhea Subscale in patients treated with an adjuvant program of pelvic radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  
2.4 To correlate TS, DPD and TP expression (key targets for 5- FU); retention of chromosome 18q 
alleles and MSI with TGFβ1RII mutation (markers for 5- FU efficacy); ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF 
expression (participants in repair of adducts from oxaliplatin); and p53 gene mutation in tumor tissue specimens with treatment efficacy.   
2.5 To correlate tumor molecular prognostic markers (chromosome 18q allelic loss and MSI) with survival.

capsules) every four hours during the night.  If there is no relief within 24 -36 hours, 
add deodorized Tincture of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 4 drops in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of bland liquid or juice every 4 hours around the clock. In addition, begin oral fluoroquinolone and continue 
for 7 days.

Revised 11/05, Addendum #4 
24 If diarrhea persists for greater than 48 hours, parenteral hydration is recommended 
(including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253033]). Oral fluroquinolone treatment also s hould be 
initiated for patients who develop an ANC < 500mm3 (even in the absence of fever or 
diarrhea) or a fever that occurs with diarrhea (even without neutropenia). Antibiotics should continue until resolution of diarrhea.  (Refer to Appendix IX, Diarrhea Management Instructions.)  
Diarrhea or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_253034] (0.25 to 1 mg IV as indicated).  Patients having recurrent problems with cholinergic symptoms may receive atropi[INVESTIGATOR_253035] (SC or IV).   Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
Patients who experience diarrhea during treatment may benefit from dietary modification and/or consultation with a clinical dietitian.  Examples of foods which may exacerbate diarrhea include milk, ice cream, whole bran bread and cereal, nuts, seeds, fried or fatty foods, fresh and dried fruit, prune juice, raw vegetables, popcorn, 
potato chips, chocolate, coffee, teas, alcoholic beverages and cooked fruits and 
vegetables with seeds or skins such as berries, corn and tomatoes.  Foods which may mitigate problems with diarrhea include fish, poultry and meat that is cooked, broiled or roasted, bananas, apple sauce, peeled apples, white bread, macaroni and noodles, baked, boiled or mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables that are mild, such as asparagus tips, green and waxed beans, carrots, spi[INVESTIGATOR_87957], squash, mild processed 
cheese, eggs and smooth peanut butter.

dosing is performed according to actual body weight.  Therefore, all dosing is to be determined solely by (1) the patient’s BSA as calculated from actual weight or (2) 
actual weight without any modification unless explicitly described in the protocol.  
This will eliminate the risk of calculation error and the possible introduction of variability in dose administration.  Failure to use actual body weight in the calc ulation 
of drug dosages will be considered a major protocol deviation.  Physicians who are uncomfortable with administering chemotherapy dose based on actual body weight should not enroll obese patients.  
5.4.7  Interruption of Chemotherapy for Reasons Other Than Toxicity  
Closure of Colostomy: The time for closure of the colostomy will be at the discretion of the surgeon and should be arranged to minimize time off chemotherapy.  Closure of colostomy following completion of chemotherapy is encouraged.  The total number of cycles should be retained.

distribution are encouraged.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Therapy Interruptions: Interruptions that are required because of RT or 
chemotherapy -related toxicity or major holidays shall not result in protocol 
violation.  Interruptions that are due to a major intervening illness (for example, myocardial infarction) shall not result in protocol violation.  
Interruptions for other reasons that prolong treatment by 5- 8 days shall 
constitute  a minor protocol deviation, and interruptions for other reasons 
that prolong treatment by 9 or more treatment days shall constitute a major 
protocol deviation.  Because it is not possible to anticipate every interruption that may be required during a cour se of RT, the principle 
radiation therapy investigator will be given discretion to not assess a 
protocol violation for interruptions for toxicity other than those described in section [IP_ADDRESS], if such interruption is felt to be in the best interest of the patient.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Instructions at the top of the questionnaires should be read to the patient. 
Assure patient’s understanding and ask him/her to complete every item without overlooking any items.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  If patients are unable to complete the forms independently because 
language, literacy, or physical condition is a barr ier, the form should be 
administered by a trained staff member. Note on the Assessment 
Compliance Form the degree of assistance required and the mode of 
administration: interview or self -administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  It is very important to review the questionnaires after the patient has 
completed them to be sure that all questions have been answered and that only one answer has been marked for each question. If the patient has 
marked more than one answer for a question, ask the patient which 
answer best reflects how he/she is feeling. If the patient skipped a question, inform the patient and ask him/her to answer the question. Always give the patient the option to refuse and indicate on the measure itself, next to the question that was not answered, that the patient did not 
want to answer the question.

5.7 Surgery  
Prior to randomizati on (for patients registered prior to surgery), patients will be evaluated and 
cleared by [CONTACT_253130].  
The surgeon should determine whether or not the tumor is fixed or mobile, resectable or not, and, if resectable, which operation will be performed should the patient go directly to the operating room (LAR, APR, LAR/coloanal anastomosis).  
Patients with any symptoms suggesting an obstruction should have a diverting colostomy placed prior to beginning preoperative therapy.  
5.7.1  Surgery Schedule  
Surgical resection should occur between 21 -56 days (3 - 8 weeks) after the patient 
completes preoperative [ADDRESS_307914] duration of the patient’s anticipated survival.  In almost all cases, this will be an LAR or APR.

5.8 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
5.8.1  Purpose  
Adverse event  data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well 
as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are 
reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial (please refer to the E3201 Forms Packet for the list of forms with directions for routine adverse event reporting).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections 
provide information about expedited reporting.  
5.8.2  Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the 
patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 
3) the phase (1, 2, or 3) of  the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253043].  
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational 
New Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
When a study arm includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply.  
Concurrent administration:  When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination 
with a commercial agent(s), the combination is considered to be investigational 
and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for 
investigational agents.  Rev. 11/05  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Revised 11/05, Addendum #4 
35 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited 
manner : 
Step 1:  Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology 
and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE  can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Additionally, if 
assistance is needed, the NCl has an Index to the CTCAE that provides help for 
classifying and locating terms. All appropriate treatment locations should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
Step 2:  Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE. 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
(investigational or commercial).  Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, 
Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event . Expected events are 
those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the 
agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes 
only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is NOT  listed in:  
• Arm A, C, D, F, and S  – the drug package insert or protocol  
• Arm B and E  – the current NCI Agent -Specific Adverse Event List for the 
investigational agent or package insert/protocol for the commercial agents  
NOTE:  The NCI AgentSpecific Adverse Event List (ASAEL) is included in Section 
5.[ADDRESS_307916] of events that should be considered 
‘expected’ for adverse event reporting purposes. The ASAEL is presented in 
the third column of the Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks List (CAEPR) and identified with  bold  and italicized  text. 
Step 5:  Review the ”Additional instructions, requirements, and exceptions for 
protocol E3201” table in s ection 5.8.6 and footnote b in Section 5.8.7 for protocol 
and/or ECOG specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse 
events that require special monitoring.   
NOTE:  For general  questions regarding expedited reporting requirements, please 
contact [CONTACT_253131]:  301- 897-7497.  
5.8.3  Reporting methods  
Arm A, B, C, D, E, F, and S  – This study requires that expedited adverse event 
reporting use the NCI’s Adverse Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS). The 
NCI’s guidelines for AdEERS can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov .  For 
questions regarding the use of the AdEERS application, please contact [CONTACT_253132]:  301- 840-8202.  
An AdEERS report must be submitted to ECOG and the appropriate regulatory agencies by [CONTACT_7053]:

5.8.4  When to report an event in an expedited manner  
Some adverse events require 24- hour notification (refer to Section 5.8.6). Please 
complete a 24- Hour Notification Report via t he NCl AdEERS website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html ) within [ADDRESS_307917] be made to ECOG

40f 5.10 Supportive Care (Chemotherapy Toxicity)  
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the 
study.  
Loperamide (Imodium):  Patients will be instructed to begin taking loperamide at the earliest 
signs of a poorly formed or loose stool.  Loperamide should be taken in the following manner:  
[ADDRESS_307933] 12 hours.  Patients may take loperam ide 4 mg (2 capsules) 
every four hours during the night.  (Refer to Appendix IX, Diarrhea Management Instructions.)  
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]:  Diarrhea or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_253052] (0.25 to 1 mg IV as indicated).  Patients having recurrent problems with cholinergic symptoms may receive atropi[INVESTIGATOR_253053] (sc or IV).  Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Antiemetics :  Patients may receive dexamethasone 10 mg IV as a pretreatment antiemetic 
before irinotecan doses, unless there is a relative or absolute contraindication to 
corticosteroids (i.e., diabetes, known sensitivity to corticosteroids, severe muscle weakness or 
myalgias, etc.).  Other antiemetics may be used in addition to the suggested regimen, if clinically indicated.  As the majority of patients on previous trials have not experienced significant nausea, antiemetics other than decadron are recommended only for those patients who demonstrate nausea and/or vomiting despi[INVESTIGATOR_253054].  
Routine use of antiemetics prior to treatment with standard dose [ADDRESS_307934] 
arms of the study (Arms C and F) and that antiemetics be prescribed by [CONTACT_253139] a patient develops nausea and/or vomiting.  
Oxaliplatin is emetogenic.  All patients receiving oxaliplatin (Arms B and E) should be pre -
medicated with an acceptable anti- emetic regimen.  
Antibiotics (for patients with persistent diarrhea) : Begin oral fluoroquinolone and continue for 7 
days. If diarrhea persists for greater than 48 hours, parenteral hydration is recommended (includi ng hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253033]). Oral fluroquinolone treatment also should be initiated for 
patients who develop an ANC < 500 /mm³ (even in the absence of fever or diarrhea) or a 
fever that occurs with diarrhea (even without neutropenia). Antibiotics should continue until resolution of diarrhea. (15)  Rev. 11/05

41 Anticoagulants:   Patients who are taking Coumadin may participate in this study; however, it 
is recommended the prothrombin time be monitored carefully (at least weekly).  
Subcutaneous heparin is permitted.  
Hyper sensitivity : Platinum hypersensitivity can cause dyspnea, bronchospasm, itching and 
hypoxia.  Appropriate treatment includes supplemental oxygen, steroids, antihistamines, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]; bronchodilators and vasopressors may be required.  Platinum hypersensitivity is an extremely rare event and should be treated promptly.  
Oxaliplatin hypersensitivity occurs in approximately 0.5% of patients receiving this investigational agent.  See Appendix VI for the "Comparison of the Symptoms and Treatment 
of Pharyngo- Laryngodysesthesias and Platinum Hypersensitivity Reactions.  
Pharyngo- laryngodysesthesias : Oxaliplatin may cause discomfort in the larynx or pharnyx 
associated with dyspnea, anxiety, swallowing difficulty and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_119403].  
Appropriate therapy includes use of anxiolytics, cold avoidance and monitoring.  See Appendix VI for the  "Comparison of the Symptoms and Treatment of Pharyngo-Laryngodysesthesias and Platinum Hypersensitivity Reactions."  
5.11 Duration of Therapy   
Patients will continue to be monitored for toxicity but will discontinue protocol therapy in the following situations:  
5.11.1  Patient experiences unacceptable  toxicity, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_253055] 5.4.  
5.11.2  If the patient requests discontinuation of therapy.  
5.11.3  If the patient’s attending physician believes that it is in the patient’s best interest to stop therapy.  
5.11.4  Disease recurrence while on therapy.  
5.11.5  Severe hypersensitivity reaction.  
5.11.6  If a patient is removed from study treatment, that patient should be evaluated for 
continuing radiation therapy +/ - standard chemotherapy or surgery at the discretion of 
the treating physician.

8.1.4  Storage and Stability   
Undiluted vials are stored at room temperature (15 -30EC), and protected from light.  
Irinotecan diluted with 5% dextrose is stable at refrigerated temperatures for 48 hours 
when protected from light.  
8.1.5  Dose Specifics   
Arms A and D: 180 mg/m2 IV over 90 minutes. Repeat every 2 weeks.  
8.1.6  Preparation  
Irinotecan mus t be diluted before infusion.  The recommended dilutant for short 
intravenous administration of irinotecan is 500 mL of dextrose 5% or a concentration 
range between 0.12 to 2.8 mg/mL.  Stability is less in normal saline.  The diluted 
solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter.

or III) rectal cancer is not currently approved by [CONTACT_1622]. When used as directed by [CONTACT_3181], irinotecan is classified as an “unapproved use of an approved agent” 
and, by [CONTACT_108], considered as an investigational agent. However, while it is not an 
indication currently approved by [CONTACT_1622], the use of irinotecan in this protocol is 
exemp t from the requirements of an IND, as described under Title 21 CFR 312.2(b).  
Commercially available in 100 mg single dose 5 mL vials and 40 mg single dose 2 ml vials containing 20 mg/mL.

• Oxaliplatin for injection :  Reconstitute the lyophilized powder by [CONTACT_1583] 10 mL 
(for the 50 mg vials) or 20 mL (for the 100 mg vials) of Water for Injection or 
Dextrose 5% in Water to yield a 5 mg/mL solution.  After reconstitution in the original vial, withdraw the required amount of reconstituted solution from the vial(s) and then dilute with 250 mL to 500 mL Dextrose 5% in Water to give an 
oxaliplatin concentration of not less than 0.2 mg/mL. Do not reconstitute or 
dilute oxaliplatin with a sodium chloride solution.  
• Oxaliplatin injection:   Withdraw the calculated dose of the 5 mg/ml solution from 
the vial(s)  and then dilute with 250 mL to 500 mL Dextrose 5% in Water to give 
an oxaliplatin concentration between 0.2 mg/mL and 2.0 mg/mL.  Do not 
reconstitute or dilute oxaliplatin with a sodium chloride solution.    
Do not use administration needles or intravenous infusion sets containing 
aluminum items (risk of degradation of oxaliplatin upon contact [CONTACT_253144]) for the preparation or administration of either the oxaliplatin for injection or the oxaliplatin injection.  
8.2.11  Incompatibilites (Both Formulations)  
Do not mix or administer with saline or other chloride containing solutions.  Oxaliplatin is unstable in the presence of chloride.  
The infusion line should be flushed with D5W prior to administration of any concomitant medication.   
Oxaliplatin is unstable under alkaline conditions.  Do not mix with alkaline drugs or 
solutions  (in particular 5- fluorouracil basic solution, trometamol and folinic products 
containing trometamol as an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] ).  When oxaliplatin is administered with 5-
fluorouracil, the oxaliplatin infusion should precede that of 5- fluorouracil.   Ensure the 
infusion lines are adequately flushed with 5% Dextrose between administration of 
the two drugs.  
When oxaliplatin is administered with folinic acid, separate infusion bags and lines 
must be used, with Y -tubing to connect the two lines prior to the single injection site.  
Under these conditions of administration, the two products have been shown to be chemically compatible.    
Do not use components containing aluminum for the preparation or administration of 
oxaliplatin.  There is a risk of drug degradation when in contact [CONTACT_253144].

8.2.17  Potential Drug Interactions (Both Formulations)  
In vitro, oxaliplatin is not metabolized by, nor does it inhibit, human cytochrome 
P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or 
CYP2E1.  Metabolically mediated drug- drug interactions of oxaliplatin on co-
administered drugs cleared by [CONTACT_253145].  
No significant pharmacokinetic interactions between oxaliplatin and 5- fluorouracil, 
irinotecan, topotecan, or gemcitabine have been observed in patients.  
Since platinum -containing compounds are eliminated primarily through the kidney, 
oxaliplatin clearance may be decreased by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of potentially 
nephrotoxic compounds, although this has not been specifically studied.  
In vitro, platinum was not displaced from plasma proteins by [CONTACT_253146]:  erythromycin, salicylate, sodium valproate, granisetron, a nd paclitaxel. 
No plasma protein binding displacement interaction are anticipated in humans.  
8.2.18  Contraindications  
Oxaliplatin should not be administered to patients with a known allergy to other 
platinum compounds.  
8.2.19  Nursing/Patient Implications  
• Premedicate w ith antiemetics ([ADDRESS_307953] and steroid) to prevent severe 
nausea and vomiting.  
• Monitor for diarrhea and treat symptomatically.  
• Monitor for neuropathies (parasthesias of hands, feet and toes and pharynx 
and occasionally cramps), if they occur, tend to be brief (less than one week) 
during the first course but longer with subsequent courses. Advise patients to avoid cold exposure and against touching cold objects. Sensory neuropathies develop with continued treatment. Ask patient if changes in ambulatio n, 
swallowing, breathing or fine motor activity have been noted.  
• Prolonging the oxaliplatin infusion time to 6 hours may alleviate acute neurologic toxicities.  
• Monitor for respi[INVESTIGATOR_253058].

8.4.3  Mode of Action  
Leucovorin ac ts as a biochemical cofactor for 1- carbon transfer reactions in the 
synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.  Leucovorin does not require the enzyme 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) for conversion to tetrahydrofolic acid.  
Leucovorin can potentiate the cytotoxic  effects of fluorinated pyrimidines (i.e., 
fluorouracil and floxuridine).  After 5 -FU is activated within the cell, it is accompanied 
by a folate cofactor, and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase, thus inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis.  Leucovorin increases the folate pool, thereby [CONTACT_253147] 5 -FU with thymidylate synthetase.

60 9. Statistical Considerations 
9.1 Clinical Endpoints  
The main endpoint of this trial is overall survival (OS). We expect OS to be 75% at three 
years for the control arm (5 -FU/LV, Arms C [Group 1]/F [Group 2]) and the study is designed 
to target a hazard ratio of 1.3 (75% vs 80% OS at 3 years; 62% vs 69% at 5 years) in either of 
the experimental arms, Irinotecan/5- FU/LV (Arms A [Group 1]/D [Group 2]) or Oxaliplatin/5-
FU/LV (Arms B [Group 1]/E [Group 2]).  
With all ma jor cooperative groups participating in this study, we expect to achieve an accrual 
rate in the range of 600 patients per year (200 patients per arm per year).  With the expected 
accrual and failure rates given above, the study will have over 82% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.3 for OS between either experimental arm and control with 3,000 total eligible 
patients (600 eligible patients per year for 5 years) and follow -up of 1.5 years after closure to 
accrual. With an expected ineligibility rate of 5%, this trial may enter 3,[ADDRESS_307958] activation for overall survival. One interim analysis will occur every six months corresponding to scheduled ECOG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) meetings, once the trial achieves 25% 
expected information ([ADDRESS_307959] activation). Analyses will 
use stratified log rank tests (stratified on the factors listed in section 4.26) with an overall 0.0167 (=0.05/3) one -side type I error. Full information will occur at 564 total deaths.  The 
O'Brien -Fleming group sequential boundary will be used to adjust for the sequential testing 
and the use function methodology of Lan and DeMets will be employed to adjust the boundaries if the actual interim analyses do not correspond with the projected information 
times given here. Group sequential O'Brien -Fleming boundaries for the first three interim 
analyses will be truncated at 0.[ZIP_CODE]. Simulation studies conducted by [CONTACT_253152] (Friedlin, Korn and George) (108) suggest that overall test size is inflated by a negligible factor from the truncation, but there may be a small gain in terms of expected stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_220580].  
Assuming one of the experimental arms is no different from the control arm and the other 
experimental arm is active, power for a true hazard ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_307960] is 74% (power is 82% for a hazard 
ratio of 1.33). If both of the experimental arms are active (at least 80% OS at 3 years), the power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_307961] is 64% (power is 80% for a hazard ratio of 1.37). Power to compare the 
experimental arms will also be higher with longer follow -up. 
This study will be monitored for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_253059] (109). At each interim analysis nominal one- sided (1 -alpha) confidence intervals on the overall survival 
hazard ratios comparing the experimental arms to control will be computed, where alpha is the nominal one -sided significance level of the use function boundary at the informati on 
fraction at the particular analyis time. If the confidence intervals do not contain the target alternative of 1.3, the ECOG DMC may consider closing an experimental arm or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_253060] a treatment difference. Conversely, if an experimental arm is found to be statistically superior to the control arm at a particular interim analysis before accrual is completed, the ECOG DMC may consider closing the control arm to further accrual.  
Patient follow -up will be completed per section 7.0. All patients will be followed at least yearly 
for survival for a period of [ADDRESS_307962] registration.  
9.2 Laboratory Correlates  
Objectives 2.4 and 2.5 seek to determine the prognostic and predictive significance of TS and other key targets of 5 -FU, E RCC1 and other enzymes involved in repair of oxaliplatin adducts  
and molecular markers (18q allelic loss, MSI and p53 gene mutation) for overall survival in 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
[ADDRESS_307963] shown that roughly 80% of cases showed high levels of expression (2+/3+) and 
20% of patients showed no or low levels of expression (0/1+). Also, we observed an absolut e 
10% difference in OS at [ADDRESS_307964] 85% power to detect an 8% absolute difference in OS at 5 years in this study (from 63% in the highly expressing group to 71% in the low/no expression group; a 35% increase in median overall survival). Calculations are based on the accrual and follow -up assumptions given in the previous section and a two-
sided 0.[ADDRESS_307965] for overall survival, assuming 85% of the patients contribute evaluable samples to the correlative component of the trial. If the split between low and high expression groups is more evenly distributed (50% in each group) then the power will be higher to compare these groups, greater than 95%.  We expect that the other targets of [ADDRESS_307966] similar power. In our previous adjuvant colon correlative study 
we found that roughly 50% of samples showed 18q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and 50% showed no loss, with an absolute difference in overall survival at 5 years of 19% (69% for no loss group versus 50% in the LOH group). Assuming that the rectal cases in this study will exhibit similar patterns of LOH, we anticipate that there will be greater than 95% power to detect a smaller difference, 63% versus 73% at 5 years, again assuming that 85% of the 
samples will be available for this analysis. If the 18q LOH split is different from 50:50, say 
25% of cases with LOH and 75% of cases with no loss, then the power will still be high, 
greater than 95%. With 50% of cases showing LOH, there will be 83% power to detec t an 
absolute difference as small as 30% in overall survival (63% versus 70% at 5 years).  
9.3 Bowel Function and Quality of Life Endpoints 
9.3.1  Quality of Life (QOL) Data Analysis  
Analytical processing of the patient bowel function questionnaire (PBF), Uniscale, and FACT Diarrhea Subscale (FACT -D) will be comparable. We will calculate 
summary scores for the PBF and FACT -D as prescribed by [CONTACT_253153]. The 
PBF will provide a score representing the number of problems experienced by [CONTACT_253154]. 
The FACT -D produces a single total score transformed onto a 0- [ADDRESS_307967] assessment ([ADDRESS_307968] treatment) in each group. The summated scores from the PBF, FACT -D, and Uniscale will be 
compared via ANOVA and two- sample t -tests (two -sample tests will be performed at 
a two -sided significance level of 0.05/3=0.0167). Supplementary analyses will include 
analysis of covariance modeling of the differences between groups over time in each of the Q OL endpoints while holding constant the various demographic and treatment 
covariates. The proportion of patients that report problems with different aspects of 
bowel function will be compared across groups using equality of binomial proportions 
testing. Fu rther analysis will involve an examination of the clinical significance for 
changes over time by [CONTACT_253155] 10 points on the 0- 100 point scale for any 
QOL endpoint (110-112).  These percentages will be compared via chi- square 
testing. All testing will be done using a two- tailed overall 5% Type I error rate (0.0167 
level for each of three pairwise comparisons).  
Concurrent validity of the QOL measures will be ascertained by [CONTACT_253156], PBF, and FACT -D values for each patient 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
[ADDRESS_307969], simple correlational data will be obtained 
via the use of Spearman's rho correlation coefficient with validity being determined to have been established if the monthly correlation coefficients are all within the range 
of 0.5 to 0.75 (113). Simple paired comparison procedures (t -tests, Wilcoxon 
procedures) will be used based on the results of normality testing (114) and the 
measurement comparison procedures of Bland and Altman (115). Equality of trends over time analysis will be carried out by [CONTACT_253157] a zero slope for the trend of different scores over time.  Finally, area under 
the curve analysis will be completed by [CONTACT_253158].  
9.3.[ADDRESS_307970] with 1000 patients per group provides over 90% power to detect 
a difference of 20% times the standard deviation. This effect size has been classified 
as small and minimally clinically significant by [CONTACT_253159].  Hence, we will have 
sufficient power to detect all clinically significant differences between individual treatment groups. With [ADDRESS_307971] over 90% power to detect differences of 10% in the rate of bowel function problems reported between groups by [CONTACT_253160].  
9.3.[ADDRESS_307972] value, and zero value (in the case of 
death) for the purposes of verifying that the results for treatment comparisons are consistent relative to various assumptions and impact of the randomness of the missing data (117, 116). Previous experience with imputation in clinical trials has 
demonstrated that the use of various imputation methods compared to complete 
cases analysis provides evidence of the degree of robustness of the results relative to the assumptions of the analytical procedure (118). We do not expect the amount of missing data to exceed 20% and therefore the results should remain relatively resistant to missing data. We will examine the data for any influence that would be likely to cause data to be missing for any other reason than simple random chance. In 
other words, we will explore the dataset for evidence to suggest that any concomitant 
influence may cause the data to not be missing completely at random.

Mutation of the p53 gene in exons [ADDRESS_307982], as in our previous publications

Evaluation of TS, DPD, TP, ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF expression will be carried out in the laboratory of [CONTACT_253207].  Drs. Diasio and Soong have laboratory space of 2000 square feet on the sixth floor of the Wallace Tumor Institute located on the School of Medicine 
Campus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The labs are modern, wet laboratories 
set up for biochemical and molecular studies with space dedicated for cell culture, PCR and biochemical assays. In these laboratories are two kinetic PCR ([COMPANY_002] LightCycler and ABI7700 Sequence Detector) Instruments, an ABI310 Genetic Analyzer for DNA sequencing, a PALM Robot -Microbeam Laser Capture Microdissector, a Pharmacia GeneQuant II 
Spectrophotometer and a WAVE Denaturing HPLC Instrument for the detection of sequence 
variants.   
[CONTACT_253210] will be supervising the entire process from the receipt of samples, the design, 
validation and performance of assays to the compi[INVESTIGATOR_253061]. He has extensive expertise in assay design and translational studies and has developed a number of kinetic RT-PCR systems, application kits and quantification concepts used commercially and 
patented by [CONTACT_253165], including those to be used in this study. [CONTACT_253210] has also 
published some of the largest series on the clinical relevance of p53 alterations, 
microsatellite instability and cytokeratin 20 in various cancer types, including colorectal cancer.  
RNA Extraction from Paraffin- Embedded Tissue (PET)  Microdissected PET from 10μm 
sections will be sent to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. RNA will be isolated from 
this tissue using the standardized protocols in the High Pure RNA Paraffin Kit (Roc he 
Cat#3270289, Indianapolis, Indiana). Briefly, tissues are homogenized and digested overnight 
in a buffer containing Proteinase K. The digest is then loaded onto a spin column containing glass fibers that bind nucleic acids. Through successive washing steps, contaminants are removed and eventually nucleic acids are eluted from the column into a 50μl solution. This process also involves incubation with DNase I and a second Proteinase K digestion to 
maximize RNA purity. Using a prototype of this kit, an abi lity to amplify RNA from 
macrodissected paraffin -embedded tissue and a correlation between RNA levels obtained 
from these tissues and immunohistochemical results has been shown previously (126).  
Kinetic RT -PCR Quantification of RNA levels of markers of 5 -fluorouracil and oxaliplatin 
response.  Quantification of DPD, TP and TS RNA levels will be performed by [CONTACT_253166] (or 
“real-time”) RT -PCR on the LightCycler Instrument ([COMPANY_002], Indianapolis, Indiana) according 
to the assay systems described in the LightCycler  - DPD mRNA Quantification Kit
PLUS ([COMPANY_002] 
Catalog#3302938), LightCycler - TP mRNA Quantification KitPLUS (Cat#3302946) and 
LightCycler - TS mRNA Quantification KitPLUS (Cat#3302954) kits respectively. In these kits, 
10μl of RNA eluate is converted to cDNA in a 30μl reaction including 1x reverse transcriptase reaction mix, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, RNAse inhibitor, a gene specific primer and 
AMV reverse transcriptase; incubated at 25
oC for 10 minutes, 42oC for 60 minutes and 94oC 
for 5 minutes. Four μl cDNA is then submitted to kinetic PCR in a 20μl reaction containing 1 x 
PCR reaction mix, a “hotstart” Taq polymerase and gene- specific oligonucleotide primers and 
fluorescent probes. The incubation times are 95oC for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of 95oC for 10 
seconds, 62oC for 10 seconds and 72oC for 10 seconds before cooling at 40oC for 30 
seconds.  
In kinetic PCR, the addition of fluorescent probes allow monitoring of amplification kinetics 
and hence, determination of a crossing point (CP or “cycle threshold”) at a partial cycle number at which fluorescence becomes detectable above background levels. CP values are 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
69 linearly correlated to gene concentration (127) hence, gene quantities are determined using 
CP values and an algorithm included in the LightCycler Relative Quantification software ([COMPANY_002]). The algorithm calculates equivalent quantities to standard curve methods (120). To 
standardize kits and normalize for sample loading and inter -run variation, final quantities are 
expressed as ratios of target to a reference (or “housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”) gene in the test sample, 
relative to the ratios of target to reference gene in a calibrator sample included in each run. Calibrator samples are included in each kit and production lot -standardized.  
The kits for DPD, TP and TS RNA quantification use the same kinetic RT -PCR system that 
has been validated previously (128). This system had a dynamic range of at least [ADDRESS_307983] down to a single gene copy for different gene targets. From 27 
individual determinations,  involving 3 different sample concentrations, 3 separate RT 
reactions and 9 individual PCR runs, the co -efficient of variation for the crossing point (CP) 
values of detection was 0.4 -1.2% and the sample quantity was 12% for this system.  
Detection mixes containing oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent probes for DPD, TP, TS and the reference gene, glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), are included in each 
kit. For the quantification of ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF RNA levels, detection mixes will be designed and validated for analysis in the same kinetic -RTPCR system as the other kits. To 
facilitate amplification from PET, small PCR amplicon sizes will be designed.   
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of DPD, TP and TS protein levels.  Five μm sections containing areas of normal and tumor tissue and continuous to those used for the analysis of other molecular markers will be sent to the University of Alabama at Birmingham for IHC 
analysis. IHC detection of DPD, TP and TS protein expression will be performed according to 
the protocols in the Anti -DPD Antibody, Formalin -Grade ([COMPANY_002], Cat #3183645), Anti -TP 
Antibody, Formalin- Grade (Cat#3183653) and Anti -TS Antiserum, Formalin -Grade 
(Cat#3186008) kits respectively. Briefly, aft er deparaffinization and rehydration, sections 
undergo antigen retrieval by [CONTACT_222120] 5 minutes. They are then blocked with 20% normal 
goat serum for 20 minutes before overnight incubation at 4
oC with either DPD, TP or TS 
antibody/antiserum diluted 1:100. Secondary Envision+ peroxidase antibody (Dako Inc., 
Glostrup, Denmark), specifically anti -rabbit for DPD, TS and anti -mouse for TP, are added to 
the sections for 30 minutes before color development with liquid DAB (Dako) for 20 minutes and counterstaining with Mayer’s haematoxylin. For DPD, sections are incubated with rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins (Dako) diluted 1:100 for 30 minutes prior to the addition of the 
secondary antibody. Between each incubation step, sections are washed twice with 1xPBS for 5  minutes. A negative control section without the addition of DPD, TP or TS -specific 
antibodies/antisera will be included for each IHC run. A positive control section from a tissue with known immunostaining patterns for DPD, TP and TS will also be included with each run and will be examined for consistency of staining.  
Protein expression from the IHC stains will be evaluated using a semi -quantitative scoring 
strategy described previously that takes into account both the intensity and extent of staining (129) . Immunostains are assessed on their intensity on a scale of 0 (no staining) to 4+ 
(strongest intensity). The proportion of cells of each intensity to a total of 100% is determined and the final score obtained by [CONTACT_253167], thus allowing a maximum score of 400 (100% at 4+ intensity).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Chromoso me 18q allelic loss:  Loss of an 18q allele will be determined by 
a >50% reduction in the area under the peak for [ADDRESS_307985] 1 of 2 polymorphic 
markers.  The results for each marker will be recorded along with the 
summary interpretation.  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] below)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Microsatellite Instability (MSI)  
Microsatellite instability (MSI) status will be interpreted on the basis of shifts in allele size with the criterion of >50% increase in tumor DNA as 
compared to the corresponding peak in mucosal DNA on the 
chromatogram. The 8 dinucleotide and 3 mononucleotide markers will be assessed. Tumors are then classified using criteria from the National Cancer Institute- sponsored workshop on MSI in colorectal cancer (93). 
Results for each marker are recorded in the project database.  
Classification of the tumor is based on the following criteria:  microsatellite-
stable cancers have shift in none of a minimum of eight evaluable markers; 
cancers with low levels of m icrosatellite instability (MSI -L) have shift in less 
than 30% of evaluable markers among a minimum of eight; and cancers with high levels of microsatellite in stability (MIS -H) have shifts in >30% of 
evaluable markers among a minimum of eight. In microsatellite -stable 
cancers, loss of an 18q allele will be determined by a >50% reduction in 
the area under the peak in tumor of at least 1 of the 2 polymorphic 
markers, as compared to non- neoplastic tissue.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Molecular Classification  
Each tumor is classified on the molecular pathway alterations and results of previous correlative studies.  A standardized report form is prepared 
including the list of each marker results and the interpretation of the case 
as: 
Microsatellite -stable with 18q allelic loss  
Microsatellite -stable without 18q allelic loss  
Low level of microsatellite instability (MSI -L) with 18g allelic loss  
Low level of microsatellite instability (MSI -L) without 18g allelic loss  
High level of microsatellite instability (MSI - with TGβ1RII mutation  
High level of microsatellite instability (MSI -H) without TGFβ1RII 
mutation  
High level of microsatellite instability (MSI -H) with TGFβ1RII 
mutation

11.[ADDRESS_307986]. Hamilton’s office, the case is logged into the project database and the stained slide is examined histologically by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hamilton or [CONTACT_253211] of the GI Pathology 
Research Laboratory for the presence of tumor and mucosa and for tissue quality for quality assurance/quality control purposes.  The review results are recorded in the database.  Tumor and mucosa tissue areas for DNA extraction are marked on the H&E slide to serve as the 
microdissection guidance slide.  The unstained slides and marked H&E slide are delivered to 
the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory (CLIA -88 approved) at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 
and logged into the project database.  The demarcated areas are scraped by [CONTACT_253169] (the vast majority of colorectal cancers can be microdissected satisfactorily by [CONTACT_253170][INVESTIGATOR_253062] -consuming method of laser capture microdissection) into separate tubes 
by [CONTACT_46776] -assigned technologist.  For unusual cases with difficult scalpel microdissection, 
Drs. Hamilton or Rashid will carry out laser capture microdissection in the Department of Pathology shared facility and the tubes will then be transported to the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory for DNA extraction.  The microdissected slides and histologic guidance slide are filed in the GI Pathology Research Laboratory (Stan Hamilton, MD, Principal Investigator) for possible future review.

patients who choose to take part.  Please take your time to make your decision and discuss it with your friends and family.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BE ING DONE
? 
 
This study involves treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery.  This research 
is being done to compare the effects (good and bad) of a combination of che motherapy 
medications.  To date, there have been very few studies of different combinations of 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_253070], who have already had surgery and radiation.  This study will compare the investigational treatment combinations o f irinotecan/leucovorin/5-
fluorouracil or oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5- fluorouracil with the standard therapy leucovorin/5-
fluorouracil.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY ? 
 
About 3000 people in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada will take part in this study . 
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY ?   
 
This is a randomized study which means that the three chemotherapy treatment combinations 
are compared with each other to find out if one is better and also to see if the order in which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253071] t outcome.  If you agree to enter this trial, you will be randomly 
assigned to receive one of the three chemotherapy combinations.  You have an equal chance of an assignment to any one.  This helps to make the results of the research more scientifically 
sound.  Neither you nor your doctor will have a say as to which schedule you are assigned to, 
but both you and your doctor will be informed as to which treatment you will receive.  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Appendix I – Page 2 of 18  The majority of patients with newly -diagnosed rectal cancer are treated with a combined 
program of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery; however, the order or sequence in which 
these treatments are given may vary, as may the chemotherapy which is administered during 
radiation.  Patients and their physicians get to choose which of tw o treatment groups they will   
be in.   
There are two treatment groups in this trial.  One group receives radiation therapy combined 
with [ADDRESS_308005] and fifth week of radiation OR the 5 -fluorouracil may be administered continuously through a catheter in a large 
vein during the entire course of the combined radiation and chemotherapy (six weeks). If you are participating in a clinical trial (R -04) conducted by [CONTACT_253177] (NSABP), you are potentially eligible to participate in this study. 
If you enter this study (E3201), you may receive a pi[INVESTIGATOR_253072] 5 -fluorouracil (capecitabine), 
which you will take twice a day during the course of the radiation. The use of capecitabine with radiation is ONLY allowed for patients if they are receiving it by [CONTACT_7624] R -04. In effect, 
you will be participating in both studies.  
Whether you receive radiation with 5- FU before or after surgery, there is a rest period of at 
least three weeks (usually four  to eight weeks) until you have recovered adequately from your 
operation.  Group one patients (pre- operative radiation with 5- FU) will have surgery within 
three to six weeks after completing radiation.  All patients will be treated according to one of 
the treatment schedules described below after their surgery.  
[ Please note: If you have received chemotherapy and radiation followed by [CONTACT_253178], you may be able to participate in this trial. Your doctor will 
determine if you can join. You, also, will receive treatment according to one of the schedules described below. ]  
Schedule A - this is a two day treatment given every 2 weeks for a total of eight 2 -week cycles.  
Medications are given before chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.  All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given intravenously (through a vein).  Irinotecan is given over 90 minutes; leucovorin is given over 2 hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick 
infusion, followed by 5- FU given as a constant infusion through a portable pump over the next 
46 hours.   
Schedule B - this is a two day treatment given every 2 weeks for a total of eight 2 -week cycles.  
Medications are given before chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.  All of the 
chemother apy drugs will be given intravenously (through a vein).  Oxaliplatin is given over 2 
hours; leucovorin is given over 2 hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick 
infusion, followed by 5- FU given as a constant infusion through a portable pump over the next 
46 hours.   
Schedule C - this treatment is given weekly for six weeks followed by a two- week break and is 
given for a total of three 8- week cycles.  All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given 
intravenously (through a vein).  Leucovorin is given over 2 hours; 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) is given 
as a quick infusion after the start of the leucovorin.

Appendix I – Page 3 of 18  Schedule D - this is a two day treatment given every two weeks for four 2- week cycles, 
followed by [CONTACT_253179].  After  completion of radiation 
therapy, four more 2- week cycles of the chemotherapy will be given.  Medications are given 
before chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.  All of the chemotherapy drugs will be 
given intravenously (through a vein).  Irinotecan is given over 90 minutes; leucovorin is given 
over 2 hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick infusion, followed by 5- FU

Schedule E - this is a two day treatment given every two weeks for four 2- week cycles, 
followed by [CONTACT_253180].  After completion of radiation 
therapy, four more 2- week cycles of chemotherapy will be given.  Medications are given before 
chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting. All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given

over 2 hours; 5 -FU (5 -fluorouracil)  is given as a quick infusion one hour af ter the start of the 
leucovorin  
If you take part in the study, you will have the following tests and procedures. Some of the  
tests required for this study would be done even if you did not participate in the study.   
 
• Female patients will have a pregnancy test.  
• You will receive a complete physical exam and be seen by a physician at the beginning of each cycle of treatment and weekly during the course of radiation.   
• Samples of your blood will be obtained, along with chest x -rays, CT scans or MRI to 
evaluate your health status.  
In addition, you will be asked to fill out brief forms with questions about your bowel function.  This will take about 10 to 15 minutes.  
If you are in the group receiving radiation therapy with 5- FU before  surgery, you will complete 
the questionnaire four (4) times:  
1. Prior to radiation therapy  
2. During the last week of radiation therapy  
3. Immediately prior to surgery  
4. Between 16 and 20 months following completion of radiation therapy  
 
If you joined the study after your surgery, but received radiation therapy with 5- FU prior to 
surgery, you will complete the questionnaire two (2) times:  
1. At registration  
2. Between 16 and 20 months following completion of radiation therapy

While you are on study, samples of your tissue, blood or bone marrow may be sent to a 
central laboratory to be examined by a central reviewer.  This review is to confirm the results 
of the local laboratory review.  
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY ? 
 
The actual treatment period on the study is approximately 8 months.  We would like to keep track of your medical condition for a period of 10 years after entering the study,  to look at the 
long-term effects of the treatment.  You may stop participating at any time; however, we 
encourage you to talk to your doctor first.   
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY ?  
 
While on the study, you are at risk for the following side effects.  The chemotherapy and the radiation may cause some, all or none of the side effects listed.  You should discuss these with 
your doctor.  There may also be other side effects that we cannot predict.  Other drugs will be 
given to make side effects less serious and less uncomfortable.  Many side effects go away 
shortly after the chemotherapy drugs are stopped, but in some cases side effects can be 
serious, long- lasting, permanent or life threatening.  Death is rare, but possible.  
Your physician will check you closely to see if any of these side effects are occurring and routine blood tests will be done to monitor the effects of treatment.

•   Taste changes  
 
*Diarrhea can occur with most chemotherapy drugs, but it is more common with 
irinotecan. The diarrhea associated with irinotecan can happen at [ADDRESS_308006], diarrhea can happen the day that you receive it (by [CONTACT_59570]), which can be treated with a single injection (shot) of a drug called atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The diarrhea can occur again, 
several days after the completion of the chemotherapy, and may last for several days. 
The best way to deal with this second occurrence is to notify your doctor immediately. 
Instructions will be given to you on how to treat the diarrhea. 
 
Less Likely   
•   Skin rash  
•   Blurred vision 
•   Loss of nails  
•   Unsteadiness when walking 
•   Allergic reaction  
•   Headache  
•   Confusion  
•   Tingling of the fingers and toes  
•   Damage to the kidneys and liver  
•   Swelling of the colon, which could cause a life- threatening infection  
 
 
Rare But Serious  
•   Stroke 
•   Spasms of the blood vessels that supply the heart, possibly leading to heart 
  attacks  
•   Lung damage resulting in shortness  of breath (may be permanent)  
•   Blood clots in legs and/or lungs  
•   Secondary cancers such as acute leukemia

ARE THERE BENEFITS TO  TAKING PART IN THE S TUDY ? 
 
If you are taking part in this study, there may or may not be direct medical benefits to you.  If 
you receive study treatment and do not show any benefit, your doctor will discuss alternative 
treatments with you.  You have been told that, should your disease become worse, should side 
effects become very severe, should new scientific developments occur that indicate the 
treatment is not in your best interest or should your doctor feel that this treatment is no longer 
in your best interest, the treatment will be stopped.  Further treatment will be discussed.  
We hope the information learned in this study will benefit other patients with rectal cancer in the future.  
 
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE ? 
 
Instead of being in this study, you have these options: 
• Standard chemotherapy alone 
• Radiation therapy alone  
• Standard chemotherapy with radiation  
• No therapy, with care to help you feel more comfortable. Treatments will reduce 
symptoms, relieve pain, and maximize comfort, diginity and control. Treatment is 
not directed at curing, slowing, or reversing the disease.  
Your doctor can provide information about your disease and will be available to answer any questions about the research study .

This study includes laboratory tests  that will analyze small samples of your tissue.  The 
samples will be taken from the biopsy materials and/or the surgery tissue which has al ready 
been collected as a routine part of your diagnostic evaluation and surgical treatment.  If you 
participate in the laboratory studies associated with this protocol, some of the leftover tissue 
will be sent to a research laboratory  for analysis.  Researchers will be performing these 
tests in order to better understand the biology of rectal cancer.  They hope these studies 
will help them better understand this type of cancer.  The results of these tests will not be 
sent to you or your doctor and will not be used in planning your care.  These tests are only for research purposes and have no effect on your medical care.  The researchers have no 
access to your identity.  You and/or your insurance company will not be charged for these 
tests.

About Using Tissue for Research  
If you participate in the laboratory studies associated with this protocol, some of the tissue 
biopsy material obtained for the clinical study will be sent to a central laboratory for 
analysis.  Slides of your bone marrow and blood may be submitted for central review to 
confirm local laboratory reviews.  
We would like to keep some of the bone marrow and tissue that is left over for future research.  If you agree, this bone marrow and tissue will be kept and may be used in 
research to learn more about cancer and other diseases.  This bone marrow and tissue will 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Appendix I – Page [ADDRESS_308008] also be approved by [CONTACT_3021]'s 
Institutional Review Board.  
Your bone marrow and tissue may be helpful for research whether you do or do not have 
cancer.  The research that may be done with your bone marrow and tissue will probably not 
help you.  It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  
 
Reports about research done with your bone marrow and tissue will not be given to you or 
your doctor.  These reports will not be put in your health record.  The research will not have 
an effect on your care.  
 
Things to Think About   
The choice to let us keep the left over bone marrow and tissue for future research is up to you.  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care and you may still take part in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.  
If you decide now that your bone marrow and tissue can be kept for research, you can 
change your mind at any time.  Just contact [CONTACT_253187].  Then the bone marrow and tissue will no longer be used for resear ch. It may be retained for diagnostic reviews related to the 
study. Tissue samples will be returned to the institutions upon written request. 
In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health.  When 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group gives them reports about your health, it will not 
give them your name.  
Sometimes bone marrow and tissue are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families).  Even if your bone marrow and tissue are used for this kind of 
research, the results will not be put in your health records.  
Your bone marrow and tissue will be used only for research and will not be sold.  You will 
not be paid for allowing your leftover bone marrow and tissue to be used in research even 
though the re search done with your bone marrow and tissue may help to develop new 
products in the future.  Similarly there will be no cost to you for any bone marrow and tissue 
collected and stored by [CONTACT_253188] . 
 
It is possible that, at some time in the future, as part of deciding on what therapy to give 
you, a new test might be available that could be performed on some of the bone marrow 
and tissue now thought of as leftover.  This situation is unusual, but it could happen.  In 
order to see that not all the leftover bone marrow and tissue are used up, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group will take care to see that some of your bone marrow and 
tissue are stored for 10 years so that it is available should it be needed by [CONTACT_253189] .  This will depend upon the amount of left over bone marrow and tissue that is 
submitted for this study; however, there may not be any left over bone marrow and tissue to store.

REGULATORY  COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING  
Study Audit  
To assure compliance with Federal regulatory requirements [CFR 21 parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 314 and HHS 45 CFR 46] and National Cancer Institute (NCI)/ Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Clinical Trials Monitoring Branch (CTMB) guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials and study data validity, all protocols approved by [CONTACT_12134]/CTEP that have patient enrollment through the CTSU are subject to audit.  
Responsibility for assignment of the audit will be determined by [CONTACT_779]’s primary affiliation with a Cooperative Group or CTSU. For Group- aligned sites, the audit of a patient registered through CTSU will 
become the responsibility of the Group receiving credit for the enrollment. For CTSU Independent Clinical Research Sites (CICRS), the CTSU will coordinate the entire audit process.  
For patients enrolled through the CTSU, you may request the accrual be credited to any Group for which you have an affiliation provided that Group has an active clinical trials program for the primary disease type being 
addressed by [CONTACT_760]. (e.g., NSABP members may only request credit for protocols pertaining to breast 
or colorectal cancers).  Registrations to protocols for other disease sites may still take place through CTSU without receiving credit for your NSABP activities.  Per capi[INVESTIGATOR_253080].  
Details on audit evaluation components, site selection, patient case selection, materials to be reviewed, site 
preparation, on- site procedures for review and assessment, and results reporting and follow -up are available 
for download from the CTSU Operations Manual located on the CTSU Member Web site.  
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)  
The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes the conditions under which protected health information may be used or 
disclosed by [CONTACT_120825]. Research is defined in the Privacy Rule referenced in 
HHS [ADDRESS_308020] participants from outside the [LOCATION_002]. Authorization to release 
Protected Health Information is NOT required from patients enrolled in clinical trials at non- US sites.

Diarrhea Management Instructions  
How to Manage Diarrhea  
 
While you are receiving the chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy, you may experience diarrhea.  In 
some individuals, diarrhea has been severe.  Therefore, it is important that you follow the instructions noted below if you experience diarrhea while being treated.  
 
What Is Diarrhea?

What Do I Take To Stop the Diarrhea?  
 
The medication used to treat the diarrhea is called loperamide.  The most common brand of loperamide is Imodium.  Loperamide comes in the form of a 2 milligram (mg) caplet and is available without a prescription 
at most pharmacies and grocery stores in the health and beauty aids section.  
 
The loperamide may cause some side effects.  These side effects are drowsiness, tiredness and dizziness.  It is important to avoid driving motorized vehicles or operating machinery if you experience any of these side 
effects.

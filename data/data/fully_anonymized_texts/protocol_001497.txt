ABSTRACT  
Context :  Primary care provide s a means by [CONTACT_626993] -based interventions 
with patients; however, many interventions have been evaluated using RCTs in non -
healthcare settings.  Three adolescent health domains are well -suited to explore delivery of 
evidence -based intervent ions in the context of primary care: teen driving, sexual health, and 
alcohol use. In each of these three areas effective parent -directed interventions have been 
identified that measurably impact adolescent health and safety (Turrisi, Jaccard, Taki, et al. , 
2001; Guillamo -Ramos, Bouris, Jaccard, et al., 2011; Mirman JH, Curry AE, Winston FK, et 
al., 2014).  
Objectives :  
The primary objective is to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_626971] -
based interventions delivered in primary care clinic settings on adolescent health behaviors 
and health outcomes.  Key secondary objectives include assessing intervention 
implementation fidelity in clinical settings and examining the effect of interventions on 
parent -teen communication.  
Study Design :  
Randomized controlled trial  with 2 study arms and 5 possible randomization groups [Arm 1  
(14-15 year olds  at well -child visit ): Sexual Health, Alcohol, Control; Arm 2  (16-17 year olds  
at well -child visit ): Driving, Control ]. See Figure 1.  
Setting/Particip ants:  
The study will take place in primary care practices in the CHOP Network.  Eligible 
participants are CHOP primary care patients that will be [ADDRESS_835537] 
8 weeks.  Adolescents that are attending  a new patient well -child visit, hold an intermediate 
driver ’s license , that are pregnant , or that have pervasive development disorder or a 
developmental delay  are exc luded from this study.  Parents and adolescents must be fluent 
in written and spoken English as the intervention materials and health coaching is only 
available in English.  Additionally, health care providers and research assistants  (health 
coaches) implementing the intervention  will be participants in the research study.  
Study Interventions and Measures :  
The study intervention being examined is called Patients, Parents , and Professionals 
Partnering to Improve Adolescent Health  (P4) and inclu des written  materials on adolescent 
health topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (parent -teen communication, sexual health, alcohol, driving – inclusive of The 
TeenDrivingPlan Parent Guide) , activit y workbooks , tip sheet brochures , in person/phone 
health coaching, and in person  or maile d health care provider endorsement and key 
messaging.   Measures will be collected at baseline pre -intervention (T0), in clinic  or over 
the phone  at the time of the intervention (T1), two weeks post - intervention (T2), and [ADDRESS_835538] -intervention  (T3) (See Table 1). We will measure feasibility of clinic 
implementation of interventions, as well as influence of interventions on parent -teen 
    
   
   vi 
communication, parent and teen knowledge, parent and teen cognitions, and adolescent 
behavioral intentions and behavior.  At the conclusion of recruitment, health care provide rs 
will be asked to complete a Health Care Provider Feedback S urvey.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Prior research has found that relationships between health care professionals (HCP)’s, 
parents and adolescent patients can be enhanced directly and indirectly (Ford et al., 2011). 
Direct strategies involve strengthening relationships and/or communication b etween 
parents and HCPs in both practice and community settings. Indirect strategies involve 
opportunities for HCPs to influence parent –adolescent relationships and/or communication 
within the context of adolescent visits. For example, HCPs can discuss the  importance of 
parental involvement and monitoring with adolescents, encourage and facilitate parent –
adolescent communication, and deliver tailored parental guidance (Ford et al., 2011).  
Primary care practices provide a means by [CONTACT_626993] -based interventions 
with patients and parents; however, many interventions have been evaluated using RCTs in 
non-healthcare settings. Implementing (and/or disseminating) and studying these 
interventions in health care settings, such as primary care, will r equire additional research 
concerning implementation fidelity and efficacy.  
1.2 Relevant Literature and Data  
An evidence -informed conceptual model for intervening with HCPs and parents is 
presented in Figure 2. As depi[INVESTIGATOR_626972], HCPs can provide general and 
individualized (i.e., tailored information) to parents in order to improve adolescent health. 
More specifically, HCPs can endorse evidence -based interventions and provide a pathway 
to obtain eviden ce-based interventions for parents and teenagers. Coupled with the 
endorsement of the HCPs, parent -directed interventions to improve adolescent health might 
gain potency. As depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2, armed with their new knowledge and skills, parents 
can alter  the content and nature of their communications with their adolescent, provide 
novel resources and domain -specific support, and continue to monitor with warmth, and 
encourage autonomy to promote overall health and safety.  
Many adolescent health domains are  well-suited to explore delivery of evidence -based 
interventions in the context of primary care. In the current study we will examine three topic 
areas: teen driving, sexual health, and alcohol use. In each of these three areas effective 
parent -directed in terventions have been identified that measurably impact adolescent 
health and safety (Turrisi, Jaccard, Taki, et al., 2001; Guillamo -Ramos, Bouris, Jaccard, et 
al., 2011; Mirman JH, Curry AE, Winston FK, et al., 2014). Pathways for delivery of these 
interv entions in health care settings that ensures implementation fidelity are lacking.  
Additionally, these interventions do not contain administrative content directed specifically 
to HCPs. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_626973].

1.3 Teen Driving  
Motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death among teens in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Teen drivers  (ages 16 to 19) are in fatal crashes at four times the rate of adult drivers (ages 
25 to 69). Inexperience is a fundamental factor in the high crash rate for novice teens . 
Studies have shown that novice drivers are at highest risk for crashing within the first six 
months post -licensure; by [CONTACT_22242], the lowest lifetime risk of crashing occurs when the teen 
is driving while accompanied by [CONTACT_626994] a “learner driver”  (Mayhew, Simpson, & Pak, 
2003; McCartt, Shabanova, & Leaf, 2003) . During the learner pe riod, teens ride with both 
family members and instructors. Many but not all teens learn driving skills through a 
minimal amount (on average, six hours) of behind -the-wheel lessons with instructors. 
Nearly all teens learn to drive with adult family members (usually parents). The learner 
period provides an opportunity to teach, practice and evaluate whether the teen has the 
behaviors and skills necessary to ride without adult supervisions. Unfortunately, the 
quantity, quality and diversity of practice driving  is very limited and many teens start 
unsupervised, post -licensure driving without sufficient preparation.  
Safe and skilled driving is a complex task that involves behaviors (e.g., skills and actions) 
that may vary by [CONTACT_626995]. Scanning, for exa mple, is such a behavior. On 
neighborhood roads, the driver needs to learn how to scan for other road users (e.g., 
bicyclists) or unexpected hazards (e.g., a child darting out in the street). In contrast, 
highway driving requires the driver to learn how to  scan far ahead in order to detect 
changes in driving conditions in sufficient time to slow or stop from a high speed. These 
behaviors are learned through instruction and a considerable amount of experience. Ideally, 
the behaviors are first taught by a pro fessional (e.g., a driving instructor) while families 
provide the necessary hours of practice. Varied, high quality practice driving with an adult 
family member for a sufficient number of hours can provide teens with a safe way to gain 
needed experience th at will prepare him/her to ride safely without supervision once 
licensed.  
The TeenDrivingPlan.org (TDP) has been designed to help improve the quantity and quality 
of parent facilitated -practice driving through guided learning, planning and logging of 
pract ice drives. More specifically, the program encourages parents to increase the number 
Figure 2.  General framework for parent -HCP partnerships to improve adolescent health  
   
   4 
of hours of behind -the-wheel (BTW) practice and to increase the range of environmental 
conditions and driving behaviors explicitly practiced during those hours. The progra m 
provides targeted on -line education and tools for planning and logging. All choices and 
plans for practice driving activities are made by [CONTACT_285448].  
 
The program integrates practical information for parents and teens with evidence -based 
intervention components to promote practice driving. It includes text -based information; 
videos, graphical and audio materials; and interactive planning and logging tools. TDP is a 
tool to provide families with a structure for facilitating practice drives by [CONTACT_63790][INVESTIGATOR_007] r oad types 
into progressively complex environments in which teens will practice specific driving 
behaviors and skills. It presents information organized around driving environments, which 
include a large empty parking lot, residential neighborhoods, commerc ial roads, 
intermediate and rural roads and highways, as well as challenging driving situations such 
as driving at night and in inclement weather.  
 
Content was identified using a variety of research methods including literature review, 
parent and teen focu s groups, a 2010 process evaluation study (IRB 10 -007530) of an 
early, limited version of TDP, interviews with international scientific driving experts, and 
interviews with a panel of expert driver education instructors. Creative content was 
developed and refined using input from parents, teens, and driver education instructors. 
Usability testing informed the design and functionality of the web application. Results from a 
randomized controlled trial are shown in Table 2 (IRB 11 -008203) (Mirman, Curry, Winst on, 
et al., 2014; Mirman, Albert, Curry, et al., in press; Winston, Mirman, Curry et al., 2014).  
Stemming from th is success, a novel implementation of  an adapted version of TDP in the 
primary care setting in conjunction with providers’ completion of the state of Pennsylvania’s 
driver’s license permit form (DL -180 (3 -14)) could offer several advantages. This form 
requires qualified health care providers to affirm that there are no medical or psychiatric 
conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol or drug abuse, other cognitive impairment) 
that preclude the teenager from safely pursuing licensure. Completion of th is form could be Table 2.  Key Results of the TDP Evaluation (Randomized Controlled Trial)   
(1) Driving Skill : Teenagers in the TDP group were 65% less likely to fail a rigorous on -
road driving assessment. The Hazard Ratio for exposure to TDP was 0.35 (95% CI, 
0.12-1.03; log -rank p = 0.05). Six percent of teenagers that used TDP had their on -
road driving assessmen t terminated due to unsafe driving performance as compared 
to 15 percent of those not given TDP (risk difference [TDP -control]: -9% (-21%, 2%), 
p = 0.06).  
(2) Parent Supervision : TDP parents were more engaged supervisors (e.g., regularly 
logged drives, gave feedback) (parent and teen report), p = 0.03 and TDP teens 
reported greater instrumental and socioemotional support from parents related to 
practice driving (teen report), p = 0.01.  
(3) Practice Variety : TDP dyads practiced at least 1 -2 hours in a greater var iety of 
driving environments than control dyads, p = 0.01 (parent and teen report). This 
increase in variety mediated the effect of TDP on driver performance.  
(4) TDP Use : The estimated relative rate (RR) of TDP use (valid log -ins) was three times 
higher (3.08 , 95% CI 1.67 to 5.69) during the first week among dyads who achieved 
high practice diversity compared to dyads who practiced in fewer environments. At 
week 3, the RR was 1.55 times higher (95% CI 0.99 to 2.43); use was similar by [CONTACT_5875]

1.4 Sexual Health  
According to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (CDC, 2013) 46.8% high school 
students reported previously having sexual intercourse and 34.0% had intercourse in the 
previous 3 months (i.e., were “currently” sexually active). Nearly 41% of students who h ad 
sex in the prior [ADDRESS_835540] time they had sex, 15.0% had at 
least four or more sexual partners, 19% reported that they (or their partner) used birth 
control pi[INVESTIGATOR_626974], w hile 14% reported 
using no form of birth control.   Further, almost 23% had used drugs or alcohol before their 
last time of sexual intercourse. Collectively, these behaviors increase adolescents’ risk for 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintend ed pregnancy (CDC, 2009; Weinstock, 
Berman & Cates, 2004; Hamilton, Martin & Ventura, 2009). Delaying the time of first sexual 
intercourse and promoting safe sexual practices including using birth control and regular 
STI testing among sexually active youth  is paramount for preventing STIs and unintended 
pregnancies.  
A variety of methodologies have been employed to encourage adolescents to adopt safe 
and responsible sexual practices to youth of varying levels of risk. Parent -directed 
approaches offer severa l unique benefits compared to group -based or school -delivered 
programs including the opportunity for parents to communicate information consistent with 
their personal values, tailor information to be responsive to the child’s life circumstances 
and context s and their child’s developmental level (e.g., cognitive, social and emotional), 
and bundle these communications into a broader set of parent -child interactions related to 
monitoring and surveillance (Jaccard, Dodge, Dittus, 2002).   
A clinic -based RCT (n= 264 dyads) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Families 
Talking Together , a parent -based intervention to prevent sexual risk behavior, among 
Latino and African American male and female teenagers between the ages of [ADDRESS_835541] care control condition (Guillamo -Ramos, 
Bouris, Jaccard et al., 2011). Intervention components were delivered to mothers in waiting 
rooms during their teenagers’ clinic visits. Dyads completed a brief baseline survey in the 
clinic, we re randomized and then completed a follow -up survey nine months later in the 
home. Primary outcomes included whether the adolescent had ever engaged in vaginal 
sexual intercourse (yes or no), and among the sexually active respondents, the frequency 
of sexu al intercourse, and the frequency of oral sex were ascertained. The parent -directed 
intervention consisted of 4 key components: (1) a 30 minute face -to-face meeting with a 
social worker; (2) a written informational “manual” on effective communication and 
parenting strategies for reducing adolescent sexual risk behavior with two activity guides; 
(3) booster phone calls to direct parents to the intervention materials and 4) provider 
endorsement of the materials.  Findings from the RCT found that sexual activi ty was 
attenuated in the intervention group (6%) and increased from 6% to 22% for young adults in 
the control condition. Incorporating this effective intervention into the workflow of a busy 
primary practice requires considering how to repackage successful  intervention 
components and materials in a cost -effective and scalable way.

1.5 Alcohol Use / Drinking  
According to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (CDC, 2013), 66.2% of high school 
students nationwide had at least one drink of alcohol on at least 1 day  during their life and 
34.9% of high school students had drunk alcohol in the previous 30 days.  21.9% of 
students nationwide had ridden in a car driven by [CONTACT_626996] 10.0% (of the 64.3% of youth who drove in the last 30 days ) had driven when they had 
been drinking alcohol.  Nationwide, 20.8% of students had had five or more drinks of 
alcohol in a row.  
Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health indicates that problem 
drinking occurs in youth as early as se venth grade and that young people are more likely to 
exhibit binge drinking behaviors if they report poor parental communication and monitoring 
(Guilamo -Ramos, Jaccard, Turrisi et al., 2005).  Thus, one potential strategy for dealing 
with alcohol problems in youth is by [CONTACT_626997].  A particularly promising parent -based intervention 
attempted to influence students before they start college through their parents (Turrisi, 
Jaccard, Taki, et al., 2001). Specifically, parents received informational materials about the 
prevalence and risks associated with binge drinking and how to convey information about 
drinking to their teens.  Parents were encouraged to talk with their teens prior to leav ing for 
college.  Teens whose parents implemented the intervention materials exhibited reduced 
drinking tendencies and experienced fewer drinking -related consequences.  
 
1.6 Improving Parent -Teen Communication in Primary Care  
Research shows that parents play an  important role in their child’s health.  In particular, 
parent -based interventions that seek to improve  parent -teen communication have been 
shown to be effective at reducing adolescent risk taking and improving adolescent healthy 
decision making.   According to Jaccard, Dodge and Dittus (2002) parent -based approaches 
allow parents to: (1) discuss information  in a way that is consistent with their values , (2) 
alter the presentation of information to fit social and familial contexts, and (3) increase 
supervision of teenagers’ activities. Additionally, previous studies have shown parent -teen 
communication to be an important factor in reducing adolescent risk taking behaviors. One 
clinic -based RCT that evaluated a parent -based intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior 
in early adolescence found that sexual activity remained at 6% among adolescents in the 
interve ntion condition, but increased from 6% to 22% for adolescents in the “standard of 
care” control condition (Guillamo -Ramos, Bouris, Jaccard et al., 2011). Similarly, a parent -
based intervention designed to influence college drinking behaviors was shown to r educe 
drinking and tendencies toward drunkenness, increase negative perceptions toward 
drinking activities, reduce peer and parental approval of drinking, and decrease drinking -
related consequences (Turrisi, Jaccard, Taki, et al., 2001). Additionally, pare nts identified 
parent -teen communication as an important factor in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_626975] a small, 
exploratory study examining the partnership between parents and health care providers. 
Parents were asked: What can parents do to keep teens healthy and ad dress health 
problems? 47% of parents mentioned parent -teen communication, citing the importance of 
talking, listening and giving encouragement (Ford, Davenport, Meier et al., 2009). Our own 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_626976]’s 
primary health care provider about how to communicate with  their child about a range of 
health behaviors (Ford et al., manuscript in preparation).  Primary care is an ideal location 
to intervene on parent -teen communication as it is protected time for discussing important 
teen health issues  and it involves a trusted expert, who can highlight the importance of 
   
   7 
parent -teen communication about teen health issues and endorse evidence -based 
interventions for parents to continue discussi ons at home .   
1.6.1  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476] - Acceptability  
During qualitative pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732]  (IRB # 14 -010850) , we investigated adolescent and parent 
interest in receiving information about health topi[INVESTIGATOR_626977] -teen communication from 
clinicians  (Ford et al., manuscript in  preparation ). [ADDRESS_835542] in receiving health and health 
communication information from the adolescent’s doctor about a variety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including 
routine, mental health, sexual health, substance use, and injury prevention issues.  The 
sample consisted of mostly female parents (84%) and adolescents that were evenly divided 
by [CONTACT_25890]; 36 were 12 -13, 35 were 14 -15, and 20 were 16 -17 years of age. 
Adolescent race refle cted the practice population (60% black; 35% white). Results indicated 
that t he majority of parents and adolescents reported moderate or high levels of interest in 
receiving information about all health issues, inclusive of information to increase parent -
teen communication.  From this preliminary work, it is clear that both parents and 
adolescents want health care professionals to help them learn, and talk about, a wide range 
of adolescent health topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Thus, primary care interventions that effectively imp rove 
parent -teen health communication and specific adolescent health outcomes would be of 
value to parent and teens.   
 
Additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_626978] t o determine acceptability of the intervention materials 
prior to trialing them  (IRB #15 -011780) . We recruited 68 parents of adolescent CHOP 
PBRN patients to review and provide feedback on intervention materials (parent -teen 
communication, targeted health topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]) and study procedures.  The study sample primarily 
consisted of caregivers who were mothers (90 %), had a 4 -year degree or more (64%), were 
married (65%) and had an average of 2 children. About half (54%) of the caregivers were 
African American followed by [CONTACT_76179] (43%); few caregivers were Hispanic (2%). 92% 
regularly wear a seatbelt when they drive a  vehicle and 78% regularly use the internet or 
check email several times a day from home.  In general, p articipants liked the materials and 
cited several benefits including: “opening the door to having a dialogue with your teen”, 
“getting on the same page as their teen’s doctor”, and “sending a consistent message to the 
teen.”  Parents reported a strong likelihood that they would use the materials and 
expressed a strong desire to participate in a related research study (unpublished results; 
contact [CONTACT_626998]) .

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_626981] -
based interventions conducted  in a primary care practice . 
2.1 Primary Objective   
The primary objective of the study is to determine if the intervention(s)  affect  teen health 
behaviors and cognitions.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objective s are  to: (1) assess the impact of the interventions on  the quality of  
parent -teen communication  and their knowledge about important teen health behaviors ; (2) 
assess  the fidelity of  implementation of the interven tions in clinic settings ; and (3) to 
conduct exploratory analyses to refine the theoretical model on which the interventions are 
based.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   [ADDRESS_835543] sizes 
on key outcomes,  and assess the  implementation of the P4 intervention. See Figure 1 and 
Table 1 for overviews.  
3.1.1  Baseline Screening Phase  (T0) 
Potential subjects will be identified using EPIC as all will come from participating PeRC 
primary care practices . Additionally,  16-17 year old patients will be identified by [CONTACT_626999].  A letter will be  
given or  sent in the mail to all eligible families to describe the study and give them the 
opportunity to call or email  the study team for more information about  participating. They  
will be verbally screened and consented using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria 
into two strata  based on age at upcoming well -child visit  (Arm 1 : 14 to 15 years and Arm 2:  
16 to 17 years ) OR current age (16 -17) if teen recently had medical certification form 
signed . We are requesting a waiver of assent for screening procedures , however  parental 
consent and child assent will be obtained over the phone for the main study  procedures.  
We are also requesting a waiver of written documentation (see Section 8.6.1 ). After 
randomization into a study group, a  demographic and baseline intake survey will be 
completed with the parent and teen over the phone  and the educational materials will be 
sent ele ctronically  (Arm 2 only) , mailed (Arm 2 only) , and/or given in person  to the 
intervention group parents  after enrollment . For a full list of assessment instruments see 
section 5.0.  
3.1.2  Study Intervention Phase (T1) 
The study intervention involves educational materials for parents to read, an in person or 
phone orientation to the intervention materials  delivered by a trained Research Assistant 
(RA), as well as a brief endorsement of the materials by  [CONTACT_627000] (HCP) 
during the teen’s well-child care appointment  or via a provider “prescription” mailed to the 
parent , and a booster health coach call delivered by a trained RA . The RA will complete a 
fidelity assessment after the health coaching clinic visit o r phone call , and booster call to 
document the components of the intervention that were delivered.    
3.1.3  Study Follow -Up Phase  
[IP_ADDRESS]  T2 
A survey will be administered to parents in the intervention groups via phone or a secure 
web survey platform within 2 weeks ( - 3 days / + 2 weeks ) of the health coaching clinic visit  
or health coaching phone call .  Surveys can be conducted at the end of the booster call or 
will be scheduled for another date depending on parent availability. For  a full list of 
assessment instruments see section 5.0.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  T3 
Electronic and/or phone follow -up surveys will be collected with all parents and teens in 
Arm [ADDRESS_835544] of assessment instruments see section 5.0.

3.2 Allocation to Treatment Group  
Randomization will be performed using a table of random numbers generated at the outset 
of the study. Neither the RA enrolling the dyad or the parent/teen dyad who agrees to 
participate will be blind to the dyads’ allocations.   During screening, participan ts will be 
allocated into two strata based on age  at upcoming well -child visit  (Arm 1: 14 to 15 years 
and Arm 2: 16 to 17 years)  (See Figure 1) . 16-17 years old who drop of their medical 
certification forms for the permit application will automatically be allocated into Arm 2.  
Participants in Arm 1 will be randomly assigned to receive usual care (control), the alcohol 
intervention, or the sexual health intervention .  Participants in Arm 2 will be randomly 
assigned to receive either usual care  (control ) or the teen driving intervention.   
3.3 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
3.3.1  Duration of Study Participation  
Arm 1 – Approximately 4 -5 months from the time of enrollment . 
Arm 2 - Approximately 6-7 months from the time of enrollment . 
3.3.2  Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted within participating clinical sites in the CHOP PeRC network . 
Approximately [ADDRESS_835545]  dyads  
(375 adolescent s and 375 parent s). Additionally, approximately 15 health care providers will 
be enrolled to produce 10 evaluable health care provider subjects.  Finally, approximately 
10 research assistants (health coaches) will be enrolled to produce 5 evaluable subjects.

It is possible that more than one eligible teen from a given family will be eligible to enroll , as 
families often schedule appointments back to back.  In these instances, only one parent -
teen dyad per household will be enrolled.  The decision on who to enroll will be selected 
based on the following criteria: 1) If there is an adolescent aged 16 -17 that is eligible for 
Arm 2, we will prioritize recruitment of this dyad; 2) If we are unable to recruit this dyad, 
then we will randomly select from the remaining eligible adolescents .

4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening Visit  (T=0)  
The study screening phase involves a letter being given or mailed home to describe the 
study to all eligible participants, verbal consent  to screen  (waiver of assent is requested) , 
verbal informed consent and assent over the phone.  After participants are enrolled,  they 
will be randomized into a study group. Then we will administer a brief baseline intake 
survey  to parents and teens separately over the phone and/or we will sen d it electronically 
to collect sociodemographic information, baseline parenting an d parent -teen 
communication  and relationship variables, baseline cognition variables, and baseline 
assessment of health behavioral variables .   
The following procedures will take place  during the phone screening visit : 
 Verbal Consent to Screen  (Waiver of Assent Requested)  
 Informed Consent  and Assent  
 Randomiz ation  
 Administ ration of  Baseline Screening Intake Assessment  with parent and teen   
 Email electronic versions of the intervention materials  to intervention group parent s 
(Arm 2 only)  
 
4.2 Study Intervention Phase  
The study intervention phase consists of written materials for parental review, an RA 
orientation  at the child’s well -child visit or over the phone,  a physician endorsement given 
during the child’s well -child clinic appointment  or mailed to the home , and a booster phone 
call from the RA approximately 2 weeks after  the initial orientation of the intervention 
materials.   
4.2.1  Intervention  Materials  
Intervention materials are shown in Appendix A -D.  Arm 1  participants in the intervention 
groups will receive a parenting handbook (Appendix A) that focuses on how to 
communicate effectively and respectfully with teenagers. It contains written information and 
activities. Depending on which group the patient is r andomized to, parents will also receive 
an additional module and tip sheet on one of three health behaviors: (1) sexual health 
(Appendix B); (2) alcohol prevention (Appendix C); and (3) teen driving (Appendix D).  
Materials will be sent electronically to in tervention group parents  (Arm 2 only)  after 
enrollment and will be provided in hardcopy to intervention group parents at the teen’s well -
child appointment  if applicable .  Parents in the control group will be emailed or mailed  
intervention materials at the end of the study when all surveys are complete . 
4.2.2  Clinic Visit  (Intervention subjects only)  (T=1)  
Intervention group parents will be greeted at the clinic prior to their child’s well-child 
appointment by a member of the research team. In a private location the parent will receive 
   
   13 
a brief orientation to the materials by a trained RA health coach on the topic to which 
they’ve been assigned. This discussion will typi[INVESTIGATOR_626983]-child visit. At the end of the well -child examination the parent and teen will meet briefly 
with the HCP  who will endorse the materials and provide key health and safety messages 
using a brief Provider Endorsement Sheet  (see Appendix E). The parent will leave the 
appointment/visit with an agreed -upon date scheduled to talk to the teen about the health 
topic (driving, sexual health, alcohol) and with a “prescription” for reading/using the 
materials and talking with the teen provided  by [CONTACT_82275]  (see Appendix E). Arm [ADDRESS_835547] 8 weeks  will receive the 
intervention materials and provider “prescription” via mail and will receive an orientation of 
the materials by a trained RA health coach over the phone.  
 
Parent and teen participants randomized to the control group s will receive care as usual  at 
their well -child visit . RAs will conduct a chart review to document whether or not the well -
child visit was completed (date/time) .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  RA Orientation  
 Greet family, move with parent to confidential/quiet location  
 Confirm Assignment Status  
 Provide o rientation to i ntervention m aterials with parent , including discussion of “The 
Basics” materials   
 Give parent hardcopy of materials  
 Bring parent to the exam room with teen and HCP  
 Give HCP  indication of assignment status (color coded file folder)  
 Complete clinic implementation fidelity checklist  (Appendix F) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Health Care Provider  Endorsement  
 Provide key messages (Appendix  E) to parent and teen  
 Provide intervention prescription (Appendix E) to parent  
 
4.2.3  Booster Call  and T2 Survey ( Intervention Parents  only) (2 weeks) (T=2)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Booster Call  
Approximately 2 weeks ( -3 days/ + 2 weeks ) after the well -child visit  or health coaching 
phone call (arm 2) , a trained  RA health coach  will place a “booster ” phone call to the 
intervention group parents to finish reviewing materials / content that might not have been 
completed at the clinic visit and to discuss questions and concerns that the parent might 
have.  Much of the flow of conversation will be guided by [CONTACT_627001].   If parents 
have not talked to the teen, the RA will discuss barriers to this happening and will initiate 
another booster call in approximately 2 weeks. This process will be repeated up to 3 times 
(i.e., booster calls will be repeated every 2 weeks for a total of 3 pos sible calls).  
The following procedures will take place during the Booster call:  
 RA places call to parent  and has discussion  about materials and the status of the 
parent -teen talk  
   
   14 
 If parent has NOT talked to the teen, RA will discuss strategies to overcome barriers 
and continue to place calls every 2 weeks , up to 3 total calls  
 Complete booster call implementation fidelity checklist (Appendix F). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  T2 Survey  
The 2 week survey will be given to the parents in the intervention groups and can be  
administered at the time of the booster call or can be scheduled for another date to be 
completed via phone or via secure web -survey.  
 
4.2.4  Final  Follow -Up Survey  (approximately 4-6 months ) (T=3) 
Approximately 4-5 months  after the well -child visit , we will administer a parent and teen 
follow -up survey to all Arm 1 participants over the phone or via secure web -survey .   
 
Approximately 6 months  after the well -child visit  or health coach phone call  (for Arm 2 form 
drop off g roup) , we will administer a parent and teen follow -up survey to all Arm [ADDRESS_835548] will be asked to provide feedback 
about their “P4 Study” experience via an anonymous survey.  HCPs will be made aware that 
the survey is part of the research study and by [CONTACT_627002].  It’s imp ortant that  the surveys are completed anonymously so the HCPs feel 
comfortable sharing any negative feedback about research personnel and/or practice 
leadership.  
HCP s will have the option to complete the survey electronically (REDCap) or via hard copy 
(paper and pencil). Providers who cho ose to complete the paper and pencil version  of the 
survey  will be asked to place their completed surveys in a lock box/bin at the practice. 
Surveys will then be transferred via lockbox to [ADDRESS_835549] Completion/Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may 
also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investig ator for lack of 
adherence to study treatment or visit schedules, or AEs. The Investigator may also 
withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety 
or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes 
the clinical study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events 
after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source 
documents and on the CRF.

   19 
 Impact on value of pediatric primary health care  
 How to implement  interventions like these  in real life practice  
 Any other  helpful  feedback  
 
5.[ADDRESS_835554] confidentiality.   
As this study involves questionnaires related to sexual behavior, it is possible that research 
subjects will spontaneously disclose information related to statutory sexual assault. In this 
unlikely instance, the RA will immediately notify the PI.  If it is a teen that made the 
disclosure, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_626985]’s 
social work department in order to determine appropriate next steps and reporting 
requirements.  If it is a parent that made the disclosure, the RA will immediately notify the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_626986]’s primary care physician 
for follow -up.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_626987]’s mandatory reporting 
requirements prior to conducting the trial.

6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_626988]. As such, some analyses may be 
underpowered and all analyses can be considered exploratory.  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoints are evaluating the difference between the intervention and control 
groups on adolescent  health behaviors  (alcohol, sexual, driving behaviors) and behavioral 
intentions  (alcohol/sexual behavioral intentions) . 
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints :  
 Reach :  The proportion of eligible participants who agreed to participate in the 
intervention; of thos e that participated: t he proportion of participants who read the 
materials, and talked with their teen about the indicated health topic . 
 
 Feasibility of delivery in high volume clinic practice:  Determine  implementation 
quality (% of intervention components delivered with fidelity) and determine their 
association with clinic -level (e.g., patient volume) and provider -level factors (e.g., 
years of experience).  These endpoints will be assessed via process measures . 
 
 Evaluate the difference between the treatment and control conditions on:  
 
 Parent -Teen  Communication : General parent -teen communication; Topic -
specific quantity and content of parent -teen communicatio n (sexual/alcohol/  
driving /strengths ); Parents’ communication self -efficacy; Parents’ 
communication intentions ) 
 Parent and Teen  Topic -Specific K nowledge : Teen driving/sexual health/alcohol ) 
 Adolescent Perceptions of Parental Attitudes : Perceived parental disapproval of 
the teen having sex, drinking, and engaging in risky driving; Perceptions of the 
parent as a trustworthy source of information on sex, drinking/alcohol use, and 
teen driving  
 HCP Relationship : Parent and teen  perception of  the importance HC P places 
on parent -teen communication; Parent and teen perception of HCP as resource 
for future routine, sexual health, and alcohol -related issues  
6.[ADDRESS_835555] descriptive 
summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and 
percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_835556] deviations, medians and range for 
continuous variable s and percentages for categorical variables will be generated for all 
quantitative data of the ov erall sample and by [CONTACT_3004] (t reatment vs. control). Relevant 
continuous measures will be evaluated for normality and those differing markedly from 
normality  will be summarized by [CONTACT_627010], interquartile ranges, and box -plots. 
Histograms will be the graphical measure used to complement descriptive analyses of 
categorical data.  
For statistical inference, we will employ a variety of parametric and non -parametric 
statistical techniques such as t -test, chi -square, Fisher’s exact test, linear and non -linear 
regression analysis, random effects models, generalized estimating equations structural 
equation modeling, will be used as needed. Some of the regressions may have to be run in 
the stepwise mode, with regression used in some steps to perform covariate adjustments of 
between -group comparisons. In other analyses, the regressions would be used as part of 
propensity analysis. Missing data approaches will be used . Statistical tests will be two tailed 
with an alpha = 0.05.   
Note that as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we realize that we may be underpowered for some 
analyses. The conduct of these analyses remain important so that we can identify practice -
level effect sizes f or the variables of interest.  
6.3.3  Safety Analysis  
All subjects randomized to receive an intervention (sexual health; alcohol; driving) will be 
included in the safety analysis. This is a minimal risk study and as such AEs and SAEs are 
not expected. However, AE incidence will be monitored and reported as necessary.  
6.[ADDRESS_835557] sizes from prior RCTs of intervention materials ( in 
non-clinic settings). Effect size estimates were taken from the TeenDrivingPlan RCT; 
treatment (n=86) vs control (n=65) (See Mirman et al., 2014 JAMA Peds) and from the 
Families Talking Together RCT; treatment (n=124) vs control (n=126) (see Guilamo -Ram os 
et al., 2010).  
Teen Driving Behavioral Outcomes  
 The average amount of p ractice quantity (0 hrs. = 1; <1 hr = 2; 1 to 2hrs = 3; 3 to 5 
hours = 4; 6 to 10 hours = 5; > 10hrs = 6)  across environments/conditions  (parking 
lot, residential, highway, intermediate roads, rural roads, night, and bad weather). 
Effect  sizes ranged from: (d=.50 to d=.34)  
 The number of environments and conditions where the teen practiced for at least 1 
to 2 hours: TX: Med(IQR) = 6 (5,6) vs. Control: 5 (4,6).  
 Teen -perceived support  (5 pt scale) , mean (SD): TX: 4.11 (.73) vs. Control: 3.78 
(.79);  (d=.43)  
 Parent engagement  (5 pt scale) , mean (SD): TX: 3.51 (.54) vs. Control: 3.32 (.55); 
(d=.34)  
*The initial TDP trial found a 9% absolute risk reduction in the termination of on -road 
driving assessments, but we will not be administering on road driving assessment in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
   
   22 
Sexual Health Behavioral Outcomes  
 Vaginal sex: TX 7% to 7% vs Control 6% to 22% (risk difference -15%)  
 Freq of vaginal sex in past 30 days ((1 = never, 2 = once, 3 two or three times, and 
4 = once a week or more): TX 1.00 to 1.08 vs Control 1.00 to 1.53; (d=.5)  
 Engaged in oral sex (proportion y/n): TX 3% to 4% vs Control 3% to 10% (risk 
difference -6%) 
 
Assumi ng a medium effect size (d=.5), desire to evaluate a difference between two 
independent means (two groups), an alpha of .05 , power = .80,  we will need [ADDRESS_835558] size of d=.34 the sample size 
increase s to 137 in each group. To evaluate the difference in proportions (e.g., a 15% 
reduction in vaginal sex) using fisher’s exact test , an alpha of .05, power = .[ADDRESS_835559] these are acceptable in terms of establishing initial 
feasibility and proof of concept.

7 PATIENTS, PARENTS AN D PROVIDERS PARTNERI NG TO PROMOTE 
ADOLESCENT HEALTH (P4) INTERVENTION  
7.1 Description  
This is a clinic based psychoeducational intervention for adolescent p atients and their 
parents  to improve parent -teen communication about important health topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] . The 
intervention is designed , if possible,  to coincide with the adolescent patients’ well -child visits  
or providers’ completion of adolescent patients’ driver’s license medical certification form 
and consists of the following components: (1) In-person  or over the phone  orientation 
session with a  trained RA  Health Coach  (HC)  and parent , (2) Distribution of 
psychoeducational materials  to the parent , (3) Endorsement and delivery of key messages 
from the health care provider, and (4) “Booster” phone call placed by [CONTACT_627011]. 
7.1.1  Trained RA Health Coaches (HC)  
HCs will be  members of the study team  trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_524014] . They will 
meet with parents of teens at the time of the teen’s well -child visit  or over the phone  to 
provide an orientation of the materials . HCs will provide hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_626989] (section 7 .1.2), deliver key messages , and work with the 
parent to identify a date and time to talk with the teen about the targeted health behavior  
using the “Basics” (see section 7.1.2 below) as a guide . The HC will place a booster phone 
call to the parent approxi mately 2 weeks after the clinic visit to re -deliver key messages , 
cover additional content as applicable , and discuss how the conversation with the teen 
went, providing support as needed.  
The g oal of the HC conversations (face -to-face and phone call s) is to provide parents with 
the knowledge and skills to have meaningful and accurate information on important 
adolescent health topi[INVESTIGATOR_626990] -efficacy and decreasing perceived barri ers. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_835560] of a Parent -Teen Communication Handbook that includes 7 modules  
on cultivating a positive parent -teen relationship and information on adolescent health and 
development. It also includes a workbook for structured communication activities “Things to 
do and things to talk about”.  This is intended to serve as a “desk refe rence” for parents and 
is not necessarily something that they would be expected to read cover -to-cover.  
This information is complemented by [CONTACT_599999] -alone  content specific  modules on sexual 
health, alcohol prevention, and teen driving. Each behavior specific module has a  brochure -
style hand out called “The Basics”.  The Basics provide parents with the essential information 
that they need to have a productive discussion with their teen about these important health 
behaviors. For the teen driving module we will us e the TeenDrivingPlan Parent Guide in lieu 
of creating a new “Basics” brochure for teen driving. See Appendices A -D. 
7.1.3  Endorsement by [CONTACT_627012] -child visit, t he health care provider will deliver key 
messages to the pa rents and teens and endorse the materials verbally , as well as 
document it on the health care provider  endorsement sheet,  and in the form of a written 
“prescription”  (Appendix E). The w ritten prescription can be mailed if intervention takes 
place ove r the phone.  
   
   24 
SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.2 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study  by [CONTACT_978] .  
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported t o the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at  the time of continuing 
review.  
  
   
   25 
8 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods  
8.1.1  Randomization  
A table of random numbers will be used to allocate subjects in to each arm of the study. At 
screening/enrollment research staff will access an electronic dat abase with the allocation 
information for each Arm.  
8.[ADDRESS_835561] and secondary data entry and electronic survey data 
distribution and collection. REDCap will also be used for tracking of study procedures (e.g. 
consent/assent and eligibility ) after having been documented on paper  forms.  Secondary 
data entry in REDCap will take place if HCPs chose to complete a paper and pencil version 
of the  Health Care Provider Feedback  Survey . HCPs  will b e asked to place their completed 
anonymous surveys in a lock box/bin at the practice.  Only members of the study team will 
be able to access the completed Provider Feedback Surveys in the lock  box. Surveys will 
then be transferred via lockbox to [ADDRESS_835562] 
that only members listed on the pr otocol can access. All data exports for analysis will be 
completely de-identified  as the study data will not be collected with any identifying 
information. All identifying information will be stored in a separate REDCap  tracking 
database and will not be exported with the study data being used for analysis . Any p aper 
forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the PI ’s administrative offices.  
We will protect subject confidentiality and ensure the data are secure in the following ways:  
1) Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier (UID) used in all data collectio n. 
2) Subject contact [CONTACT_627013] a secure REDCap database.   
Access to the identifiable data in REDCap will be limited to study team 
member s. 
3) All files, forms, databases, and printouts will be available only to staff working on 
the study. All research staff will be CITI certified.  
8.[ADDRESS_835563] obtaining IRB approval. The 
investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and 
any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset . 
8.[ADDRESS_835564] previously identified as 
important and val ued (Ford et al., unpublished data ). Further, prior evaluations of  these 
materials have demonstrated effectiveness in other settings . The control condition is usual 
practice / standard care with which there are no known risks (i.e., adolescents in the cont rol 
group will receive the usual care typi[INVESTIGATOR_626991] -child 
visit). There are no physical or economic risks. The learning -to-drive period is the safest 
period for new drivers and no safety negative outcomes have ever b een observed in our 
prior research with this population of learner drivers.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_835565] in participating .  
8.6 Verbal Consent to Screen & Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
All interested parental participants will be asked to complete a brief verbal consent to 
screen for eligibility  over the phone . We have requested a waiver  of assent for the verbal 
consent to screen, as we will be able to obtain all relevant  information from the parent  
directly. However, w e will still collect verbal assent from the teens for the main study 
procedures.   
If participants are interested and meet  all eligibility criteria, a  member of the research team 
will collect parental  consent and teen assent, as well as  HIPAA Authorization over the 
phone  prior to their well -child visit appointment . The study team member will speak to 
parents first, followed b y teens. After speaking with parents w e will ask that the teen to 
move to a quiet and private location in the home. Potential participants will be given  as 
much time as they need to ask questions.    
   
   [ADDRESS_835566]  
has turned 18 years old he/she  is able to c onsent to participation in the research study for 
him/herself . The RA will proceed with the informed consent process as outlined above.  
8.6.1  Waiver of  Documentation of  Consent  and Partial Waiver of HIPAA  
This research study meets the criteria for wavier of doc umentation of consent/assent under 
#46.117(c) (2). The research presents minimal risk to participants and involves no 
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.  
All subjects will b e given a study information letter (Appendix L); letters will be  given in 
person at their well -child visit,  mailed  home,  or emailed based on the families’ preference  
after enrollment .  As we are randomizing prior to the clinic visit it is too late to screen and 
cons ent at the time of the visit. We have kept research procedures (consent, surveys) 
separate from in office procedures  so as not to disrupt the flow of the clinic and to gauge 
whether or not the intervention can be implemented with fidelity during normal cli nical 
operations  (see Secondary Aim section 6.2). 
Additionally , a waiver of documentation of consent is requested for the completion  of the 
Health Care Provider Feedback S urvey. The survey introduction contains language 
denoting that by [CONTACT_627014].  
8.7 Payment to Subjects/Families  
All parents will be compensated $10 for completing the Intake Survey  and $2 0 for 
completing the final follow -up survey.   Intervention group parents will be compensated $5 
for completing the 2 week survey.   
All adolescents will be compensated $10 for completing the Intake Survey and $[ADDRESS_835567] complete access to all study data and will publish results of 
the study in the form of manuscripts which will be submitted to the peer -reviewed scientific 
literature in journals relevant to the topic area.

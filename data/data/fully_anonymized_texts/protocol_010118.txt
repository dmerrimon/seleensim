Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 6 3.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
3.1 Background Implanting aqueous drainage devices has become an increasingly common surgical treatment for 
glaucoma.  Medicare data between 1995 and 2004 demonstrated a steady increase in the use of these devices.
1,2 Even with the advent of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), aqueous drainage 
devices is still a mainstay of treatment for uncontrolled  intraocular pressure (IOP ).[ADDRESS_82717] common aqueous drainage devices used is the Baerveldt implant ( [COMPANY_012], Vision, 
Jacksonville, [LOCATION_012]) (Figures 1&2).

  The Baerveldt implant is an FDA -approved silicone, non- valved implant. This device comes in 3 variants: 
a single 250 mm
2 model and two 350 mm2 models (Figures 1&2). For the purposes of this study, we will 
be focusing on the Model BG-101-350, (Figures 1&2) which will be the only variant of the Baerveldt 
evaluated in this study.  As it is non -valved, it needs early restriction of fluid flow to minimize hypotony 
while the eye forms a fibrous capsule around the implant . One common way of restricting fluid flow is by

 The Ahmed ClearPath is a new ly developed  non-valved glaucoma drainage device that ente red United 
States markets in late 2019 (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) (Figure 2). This device comes in two sizes: a 250 mm
2 model (Figure 3A) and a 350 mm2 model (Figure 3B). W e will be focusing 
on the [ADDRESS_82720] this with sutures of differi ng materials or size per 
preference.

3.[ADDRESS_82721] compared the efficacy  of the Baerveldt to the older , valved Ahmed  FP7 glaucoma 
drainage device (Ahmed Glaucoma Valve; New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) . These 
studies have yielded mixed results, and many surgeons will opt to use e ither a Baerveldt or an Ahmed  FP7 
depending on a number of patient-dependent factors. However, there is currently no data published 
comparing the Baerveldt to the new, non -valved Ahmed ClearPath. We are interested in performing a 
head -to-head trial in orde r to compare  overall efficacy  and failure rates  of the Baerveldt as compared to 
the ClearPath . Criteria for device failure includes: IOP >18 mmHg or not reduced by 20% less than 
baseline on two consecutive visits after three months, IOP < [ADDRESS_82722] appropriate device to achieve favorable outcomes  while minimizing complications.  
  

Ver. Date:  05/10/[ADDRESS_82723] -operative surgical outcomes and complication rates in patients with a Baerveldt 350 
aqueous drainage device (model 101-350; [COMPANY_012], Vision) vs  the Ahmed ClearPath implant 
(350 mm2; New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA).  5.[ADDRESS_82724] will be randomized 
to the Baerveldt group or ClearPath group at the time of consent for the study. A baseline eye exam will 
be conducted as per the study flowchart (Section 2). Surgeons will include  
• Pratap Challa, MD  
• Jiaxi Ding, MD  
• Sharon Freedman, MD 
• Divakar Gupta, MD 
• Leon W. Herndon Jr, MD 
• Thomas G. L. Hunter, MD 
• Stuart J. McKinnon, MD, PhD 
• Filipe Medeiros, MD, PhD 
• Frank J. Moya, MD  
• Kelly Muir, MD 
• Jullia Rosdahl, MD 
• Henry Tseng, MD, PhD 
• Molly Walsh, MD 
• Joanne Wen, MD 
 It will not be possible for the surgeon to be masked  given that s/he will be implanting the device. The 
subject will then be seen on post-operative day 1 (±1 day), week 1 (±5 days), week 4 (±1 week), week 6 
(±1 week), month 3 (±1 week), month 6 (± 2 weeks) and year 1(±1 month) as per the standard-of- care 
post- operative schedule.  At each of these post operative visits, ophthalmic exams will be conducted, 
collecting data such to be in accordance with the study flowchart (Section 2).  
 5.[ADDRESS_82725] Selection  
Subjects will be identified from patients presenting for ophthalmologic consultation at the Duke Eye Center and/or one of its satellite clinical locations. Individuals with uncontrolled glaucoma are routinely available from this clinic and will be the prim ary study group. A care provider known to the patient will 
introduce the study and his/her ophthalmologist will be asked for prior approval to enroll the patient.  The target enrollment will be approximately 304 subjects.  Subjects will not be compensated for participation. 
All adults meeting study criteria (as detailed in Section 6.0) will be asked to participate.  
Informed consent will be obtained for each patient. The surgeon or his /her study staff will initially 
approach potential subjects for consent. During the consent process, the person obtaining consent will  
inform the potential subject of all elements of informed consent and shall discuss the nature of the study, its requirements and its restrictions. Adequate time will  be allowed for the potential  subject to ask 
questions prior to deciding whether to participate in the study.   
 
Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 9 5.3 Sample Size  
Approximately 152 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment gr oup for a total of approximately 304 
subjects. This sample size was based on a power analysi s aimed at detecting a 2 mmHg difference in IOP 
between the Baerveldt and ClearPath groups with 80% power, using the mean post- op year 1 Baerveldt 
IOP of 13.6±5.9 mmHg from the pooled AVB and ABC data.4 The results were adjusted for an expected 
10% drop out rate at [ADDRESS_82726]’s baseline 
exam findings will be documented, including:  age, sex, race, glaucoma diagnosis and cause, ocular history 
(including prior treatments and procedures), best- corrected Snellen visual acuity, IOP by [CONTACT_76157] (masked, 2-person) , glaucoma medications, slit l amp findings , external exam 
findings, motility exam, Humphrey Visual Field, Optical Coherence Tomography, and a patient reported -
reported dysesthesia scale.     5.6 Randomization  and Masking 
At the time of consent,  subjects will be randomized to receive either the Baerveldt or ClearPath  according 
to a computer -generated randomization code.  Study subjects will be masked as to which implant they will 
receive. In the patient chart, the device will be noted at a glaucoma drainage device (GDD).  
 5.[ADDRESS_82727] will participate in the study for approximately 1 year . Participation will include an initial 
evaluation where the decision to undergo implantati on of Baerveldt or ClearP ath implant is made and a 
baseline visit.  Following surgery, the patient will be evaluated per study schedule (detailed in Section 2.0) 
 5.[ADDRESS_82728] approximately 1 year  for each patient enrolled. Study recruitment 
is anticipated to occur over the cour se of 2 years with 1 year follow up for each patient enrolled. 
Therefore, we anticipate a total study duration of 3 years.

8.1 Statistical Considerations  8.1.1 Analysis Plan The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subj ects who had at least one post -op 
assessment. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population with Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). If a subject is deemed to hav e a failed surgery and undergoes a rescue 
procedure, the last observation collected prior to the intervention will be used  for efficacy analyses at all 
later timepoints.    8.1.2 Study hypotheses The analysis will be based on the following null hypothesis:   there is no difference in IOP or complication 
rates in patients who undergo Baerveldt implant vs those who undergo ClearPath implants . 
 8.1.[ADDRESS_82734] a 
2 mm difference in IOP with  80% power (accounting for a 10% drop out rate). The total planned 
enrollment for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_76155] [ADDRESS_82735] PROTECTION  9.1 Safety and Confidentia lity 
No long- term safety concerns are anticipated as a result of study interventions  as both devices are FDA 
approved.  The surgeon and his /her study staff will monitor safety events on a regular basis. Afte r-hours 
contact [CONTACT_76158]. Subject records will be maintained on a password -protected computer or in a locked file, and a study -assigned 
identification number will be used in lieu of th e subject’s name [CONTACT_76160].   
 9.[ADDRESS_82736] Consent:  A consent form has been developed that describes the nature of the research, the risk/benefit ratio, and the voluntary nature of subject involvement. Consent will be obtained directly from the participant in a private location within the clinic by [CONTACT_9154], study coor dinator, or other study staff. Potential s ubjects will be 
given a verbal explanation of the research and then will be granted ample time to read the co nsent form or 
have the consent read to them if necessary, and permitted to ask questions. Subjects unwilling to provide signed consent will not be enrolled.  
 9.3 Risks and Benefits:   As both arms of this study are consistent with current standard-of- care practices, we do not anticipate any 
increase in rates of complication compared to the reported rates in published literature.     
Ver. Date:  05/10/2020 12 9.4 Discomforts and Inconveniences:   
The expected discomforts and inconveniences are related to the placement of a Baerveldt or ClearP ath 
implant and the time required in the standard -of-care post- operative follow u p. Participation in this study 
is not expected to add any significant discomfort and/or inconv enience to the subject as the study 
interventions and follow-up schedule are utilized in current standard of care post- operative management.

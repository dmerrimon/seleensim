Project Title: Recovery of cardiov ascular function with epi[INVESTIGATOR_429471] a fter human 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_429472]. 
 
Overall Objective : We propose to demonstrate that epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] (ES) can be used to 
recover significant levels of autonomic control of cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_429474]. This interve ntion 
would provide an immediate therapeutic alternative to individuals who now have no recourse for 
treatment. The reduction in the cost to the health care system, care givers and society would be 
dramatic.  
Introductory Statement and Background :  In the c ontext of studies of human locomotion, we 
made the astonishing observation that three individuals who had been diagnosed as clinically 
motor complete (unable to voluntarily activate muscles below their level of lesion) developed the 
ability to voluntarily move their toes, ankles, knees and hips only in the presence of tonic ES of 
the lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_429475] [1]. Even more 
surprising, over a period of months, they reported improved temperature regulation, bowel and 
bladder function , and normalized sexual activity. We also measured significant improvements in 
cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_429476].  
Cardiovascular Function . Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mor bidity for 
individuals with SCI [2]. Reduction in peripheral blood flow increases the risk of pressure ulcers, 
parasympat hetic imbalance increasing vaso vagal syncope, fatigue  and cognitive dysfunction, and 
symptomatic orthostasis which are manifestations of the reduced quality of life experienced by 
[CONTACT_156999] [3-5]. With time , post injury epi[INVESTIGATOR_429477] [3, 5, 6] . The causes of orthostatic hypotension in 
individuals with SCI are multifactorial and can be classified into either neurogenic (related to 
injury to the autonomic nervous system which controls cardiovascular function and has tracts 
through the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) or other physiologic consequences of SCI [3-5] . Other conditions that 
could contribute to orthostatic hypotension following SCI include altered baroreceptor 
sensitivity, lack of skeletal muscle pumps, cardiovascular deconditioning, altered salt and water 
balance and altered cerebral vascular autoregulation. A combination of sympathetic agonists and 
venous compression devices are the only measures available for treatment of these symptoms.  
We propose that cardiovascular control is mediated by [CONTACT_96945][INVESTIGATOR_429478] (Figure 1). 
This spi[INVESTIGATOR_429479]. W e have demonstrated in rats with chronic 
SCI that the sacral cutaneous or visceral afferents produced significant activation of the 
sympathetic activity within the renal nerve and correspondingly significant alteration in arterial 
blood pressure [6]. ES in the absence of descending input can modify the excitability of the 
relevant spi[INVESTIGATOR_429480] c input and 
approximate normal cardiovascular control. It is also possible that ES restores conduction 
properties of residual damaged or non -functional, but anatomically intact axons across the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429481]. If this is the case, then ES alone wit hout the cardiovascular stress of stand 
training should restore near normal cardiovascular control. If, however, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429482] 2 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  is the key controller, then stand training with ES will be needed to optimize autonomic function. 
The ultimate goal i s to develop appropriate parameters for ES that will activate spi[INVESTIGATOR_429483] a more normal arterial blood pressure. If  we can 
improve the management of this secondary complication of SCI, we would not only improve the 
health of this disadvantaged population but also dramatically reduce health care expenditures.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] . Respi[INVESTIGATOR_429484] [2]. Following SCI, control of respi[INVESTIGATOR_429485] [7, 8]  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_429486] [9] which significantly impede recovery [10] and diminish quality of life [11]. Exercise 
programs involving limb muscles are known to increase fitness and improve ventilatory function 
in individuals with chronic SCI [12, 13] . However, none of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_429487] [14]. 
Preliminary results of locomoto r training studies from our center indicate that the locomotor step 
training in individuals with motor complete SCI leads to increased spi[INVESTIGATOR_429488], but does not improve the voluntary initiated respi[INVESTIGATOR_429489]. It has been shown that spi[INVESTIGATOR_429490] [15]. However, the three individuals who received  ES increased their respi[INVESTIGATOR_13999]. Therefore, based on our observations, we hypothesize that ES of the lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_429491] -activation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_429492].  
Restoration of voluntary control of movement.  The critical role of the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_429493] h the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429494] a conduit of these signals in 
primates has long been a widely held belief. This premise then limits the options for recovery to 
paralysis only occurring with repair or regeneration of these pathways. Our recent observations 
of three individuals with motor complete injury regaining the ability to voluntarily move their 
hips, knees and ankles upon command only in the presence of ES (Figure 2) challenges this 
theory and provides a novel treatment strategy for paralysis. The conce ptual basis of our 
approach is that epi[INVESTIGATOR_429495] -specific training re -engages existing 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_429496] -injury circuitry to reorganize in functionally significant 
ways [1, 16, 17] . We provide a cellular environment that enables sensory -motor and autonomic 
circuits to recover significant levels of function. We are capi[INVESTIGATOR_429497]. Another point of significance in our approach is 
the high level of functional interdependence among the many physiological systems impacted by 
[CONTACT_429594]. The first motor complete subjec t studied, who has trained to stand and 
to voluntarily move his legs with ES for over 2 years, showed  restoration of cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], bladder, bowel, temperature regulation and sexual function in addition to recovery of 
movement and ability to stand.  
Preliminary Data : Preliminary data in one motor complete quadriplegic patient with chronic 
hypotension and symptomatic orthostasis have shown that with optimized epi[INVESTIGATOR_429498], we can maintain systolic blood pressure ( SBP) 20% above his nadir and prevent  
symptomatic hypotension.

Rationale : We propose to determine the functional gain that can be achiev ed in voluntary 
control of movements below the level of injury and autonomic nervous system function as a 
result of activation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_429499] (ES) in humans with paralysis. In 
addition to the scientific advances, the proposed experiment s are essential to translating this 
therapeutic approach to a larger scale, which is needed to have a meaningful  clinical impact. ES 
for recovery of neurological function in patients with severe SCI is not  widely used because of 
uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of action and convincing evidence of efficacy in a larger 
numbers of subjects. Our approach will allow us to determine specific types of ES needed for

neurophysiological approaches that can detect different sources of supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_429502], reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_429503] o r emerge with ES and

Research Plan:  
1. Specific Aims  
a. Specific Aim 1 . Demonstrate whether cardiovascular dysfunction improves in 
response to ES and stand training.  
Hypothesis 1.1: ES and stand training will significantly increase resting 
systolic blood pressure ( SBP) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) and 
decrease heart rate ( HR) to a greater extent than ES alone.  
Hypothesis 1.2: Serum catecholamine  levels will increase with ES and to a 
greater extent with ES and stand training.  
Hypothesis 1.[ADDRESS_543594] damage above 
Page 5 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  the level of sympathetic output to the sympathetic gan glia. In individuals without neurologic 
injury who were subjected to weightlessness , experienced loss of cardiovascular control as 
observed with astronauts experiencing orthostatic hypotension, syncope on standing, and 
tachycardia [3]. Changes in blood distribution occur with postural changes. These blood 
distribution c hanges stimulate peripheral autonomic nerves that activate smooth muscles,  
reducing the capacitance of the vasculature and increasing cardiac return, preventing decreases in  
SBP and increases in heart rate.  
b. Specific Aim 2 . To evaluate whether task specific training combined with ES can 
improve pulmonary function and restore activation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_429505].  
Hypothesis 2.1: Task specific stand training using ES parameters optimized 
for standing will result in more successful generation of voluntary 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_429506].  
The combination of stand training, specific for functional spi[INVESTIGATOR_429507], with 
ES, needed to increase the locomotor and respi[INVESTIGATOR_429508], might be 
required for successful respi[INVESTIGATOR_429509]. If voluntary movement training and stand  
training with ES will lead to the bigger respi[INVESTIGATOR_429510], it will indicate that ES might facilitate 
both the strengthening of su praspi[INVESTIGATOR_429511].  
c. Specific Aim 3 . Identify mechanisms of restoration of voluntary movement with  
ES after paralysis.  
Hypothesis 3.1: Task specific voluntary movement training using ES 
parameters optimized  for voluntary movement will result in more 
successful voluntary movements than ES for cardiovascular function.  
Hypothesis 3.2: Task specific stand training using ES parameters optimized 
for standing will result in more successful generation of voluntary 
movements than ES without task specific training.  
We propose that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429512]. We predict that the circuitry is 
continuously adapting to activity -dependent events that functionally configure the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429513] a specific motor task. Another possibility is that the ES 
retrogradely stimulates residual axons that anatomically crossed the lesion but were n ot 
functional. Also, the ES could restore the conduction properties that were lost with  
demyelination or other consequences of damage [1, 16,  33-36]. If only the restoration of the 
conduction of the residual supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_429514], then the ES alone without 
voluntary or stand training should be sufficient to restore voluntary movement of the legs. 
However, if the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429515] a k ey controller, then task specific training of voluntary  
movement in the presence of ES will also be required to optimally generate voluntary movement.  
Stand training with ES may also be required for the recovery of voluntary movement given 
that the nervous system evolved in an anti -gravity environment and information related to load 
bearing has been shown to be a critical factor in modulation of neural a ctivity [1, 37, 38] . 
Astronauts and research animals who are neurally intact return to earth with neural disorders 
such as spasticity and clonus that are common to individuals with sp inal cord injury [39], 
Page 6 of 30 
Version : 09/27/[ADDRESS_543595] inevitable that there will be some overlap of the circuitries of voluntarily moving the 
lower limbs when bearing weight as well as when one is not load bearing.  
 
d. Specific Aim 4 . Identify supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_429516] . 
Hypothesis 4.1: Stand training using ES parameters optimized for stand 
and voluntary training using ES parameters optimized for voluntary 
movement will significantly increase the amplitudes and decrease the 
latencies of evoked potentials of the leg muscles using transcortical 
electromagnetic sti mulation (corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]) as well as facilitate the 
monosynaptic excitability of motoneuron pool of m.Soleus (H - reflex) after 
conditioning galvanic vestibular stimulation vestibular stimulation 
(vestibulospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]), an audio startle reaction (reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]) , and stimulation 
of the ulnar nerve (propriospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]).  
Hypotheses 4.2: Voluntary movement training using ES parameters 
optimized for voluntary training will significantly increase the amplitudes 
and decrease the latencies of evoked potentials of the leg mus cles induced 
by [CONTACT_429596] (transcortical electromagnetic stimulation).  
Hypotheses 4.3: Stand training using ES parameters optimized for stand 
training will significantly facilitate H -reflex and/or increase the amplitudes 
and decrease the la tencies of evoked potentials of the leg muscles after 
conditioning with galvanic vestibular stimulation (vestibulospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]), 
induction of an audio startle reaction (reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]), stimulation of the 
ulnar  nerve (propriospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]) or by [CONTACT_429597] (corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]) , demonstrating an activity -dependent effect on 
all supra -spi[INVESTIGATOR_429517].  
Hypotheses 4.4: The anatomical and axonal integrity of the neural tissue in 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (according to MRI) will have a positive relationship to the 
degree of restoration of voluntary movement after complete motor 
paralysis.  
Experimental activation of descending motor tracts on leg muscles and the soleus H -reflex have 
been studied extensively in humans using cor tical stimuli to activate the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735]  [27, 
30, 32] , galvanic stimulation to activate the vestibulospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] [19, 21 -24], auditory stimulation 
to activate the reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735]  [29], and s ensory stimuli to activate long propriospi[INVESTIGATOR_61567] 
[20, 25, 26, 28, 31] . The unique aspect of this proposal is that we will  customize the se 
experimental paradigms by [CONTACT_429598] 7 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  descending pathways and the long propriospi[INVESTIGATOR_429518]’ viability in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_429519] [19-21, 23 -25, 28, 40 -65]. A soleus H -reflex recruitment curve and the 
conditioning stimulation paradigms (i.e. transmagnetic, galvanic, auditory startle, or ulnar nerve) 
specific to each pathway will be conducted. The amplitudes and latencies of the soleus H -reflex 
will be calculated.  
2. Methods and Procedures  
a. General Experimental Design . We will enroll [ADDRESS_543596] and for scientific eligibility by [CONTACT_360950] (see Human Subjects section below). After eligibility is determined and 
consent procedures are implemented, the individual will undergo all clinical and 
neurophys iological assessments for voluntary movement, cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2606]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be conducted at the time of enrollment to  
establish structural integrity of the nerve tissue and to establish the severity of injur y and diffuse 
tensor imaging to establish the axonal integrity. A standard MRI of the area of injury will be 
conducted and it will be read by a radiologist and the following measures will be made: 1) the 
number of sagittal cuts in which the signal change i s present, 2) maximum height of signal 
change, 3) maximum area of signal change, 4) maximal canal compromise will calculated 
(MCC) and 5) maximal spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] (MSCC). All of these measurements will be 
made on the mid sagittal view.  
Participants  will continue with their current daily activities  for 80 consecutive days without 
any intervention (usual care) followed by [CONTACT_429599]. Surgical implantation of  the 5 -6-5

Harkema. If appropriate motor responses cannot be  obtained initially, the electrode will be  
repositioned as many times as required in order to obtain optimal motor responses from the legs. 
Optimal position of the electrode will cover L1 -S1spi[INVESTIGATOR_351171]. The wire lead connected to the 
Specify 5-6-5 or Specify 5 -6-5 SureScan MRI electrode will be sutured tightly to muscle to 
prevent its being dislodged. The surgical incision will be closed in layers, and a wire connected 
to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_429524] t 4 inches to the right of the midline. A sterile 
dressing will cover the external wire, and the midline incision will be closed.  
The next part of the operation will be performed while the patient is in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_429525]. The patient will be turn ed from the prone to the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/side position keepi[INVESTIGATOR_429526]. The abdomen, lower thoracic area, and right flank will be prepped 
using betadine soap. A lower abdominal incision will be made approximately 4 inches in lengt h 
and will be carried to the subcutaneous area directly external to the abdominal muscle layer. A 
wire passer will be threaded circumferentially to the lateral flank incision to the site of exit of the 
electrode wire to allow the distal portion of the elec trode wire to be threaded through the wire 
passer. The distal (abdominal) aspect of the electrode wire will be attached to the battery pack of 
the Specify [ADDRESS_543598]. An implanted package containing stimulating circuits, rechargeable battery, and wireless 
communication activates the electrodes (16 platinum electrodes arranged in three columns of  [5-
6-5]). The pattern of electrically active electrodes, as well as electrode voltage, stimulating 
frequency, and stimulating pulse width can be remotely programmed. Since different spatial 
activation patterns and different frequency parameters affect dif ferent spi[INVESTIGATOR_371797], the array 
can be reconfigured, within limits, to bias its facilitating effects toward different activities, such 
as cardiovascular control or voluntary movement.  
Page 9 of 30 
Version : 09/27/[ADDRESS_543599] antation. Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_429527]/frequency responses [66] will be 
conducted and the spec ific configurations and parameters optimal for voluntary movement, 
standing and cardiovascular function will be identified.  
The individual will then undergo ES stimulation optimizing cardiovascular function for 80 days 
for 2 -6 hours per day (Appendix A).  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_429528] , we 
observed in two individuals that as they continued stimulation they were able to maintain normal 
blood pressure levels without stimulation  for some periods of time .  In one individual , the 
stimulation was always needed  to maintain systolic blood pressure within normal ranges, 
however if allowed to stimulate for longer periods of time  they may have reached normal ranges 
without needing ES .  Thus, the protocol now reflects ES time periods customized to th e actual 
modulation of the blood pressure for each individual.  The individual will monitor their blood 
pressure and use the stimulator during those periods when their systolic blood pressure is outside 
the targeted range.  The individual chooses  the time periods during the day they will use the 
stimulator with a minimum of [ADDRESS_543600] 15 minutes  of no stimulation should occur  before resuming 
stimulation  again . Cardiovascular ES is limited to 6 hours each day.  Each session of ES can be 
less than 2 hours if the blood pressure remains within the targeted range without stimulation.  
Stimulation periods will be conducted and obser ved in the laboratory before being approved to 
be done in the home.  
The same clinical and neurophysiological assessments again will be repeated  (Post CV 
Training) . The research participant will then undergo ES for voluntary movement  (VM)  sessions 
for 80 da ys for 2  sessions  per day , in addition to continuation of ES for CV function . The CV 
sessions can be conducted at home. The voluntary sessions will be conducted both in the 
laboratory and at home.  Each voluntary session will be focused on the leg and/or trunk.   The 
remote device records the minutes of stimulation and parameters used so these will be collected 
on those days the research participants are not in the laboratory. For approximately the first 5 
sessions of each intervention  (CV or VM) , the sess ions may be conducted in the laboratory under 
the supervision of the investigators. The optimal parameters will be identified and programmed 
into the remote device. For the following sessions, the research participants will come to the 
laboratory at least once every 2 week s and CV and VM  parameters will be evaluated . The final 5 
sessions may also be conducted in the laboratory  (monitoring purposes, if necessary) . The 
research participant will then complete the same clinical and neurophysiological assessments  
(Post V M Training) .  
In our previous early feasibility studies we have found that the intensity (daily session number) is 
a critical factor in the recovery of voluntary and independent standing recovery.  The first three 
research participants in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_429529] -ES to their home environment  unlike those in our other study who had training 
twice a day .  Thus, now in t he final intervention we will include daily stand training sessions 
once o r twice a day (1 -hour each) with ES stimulation parameters optimized for standing for 80 
sessions. Research participants will participate in 2-6 hours of cardiovascular and 2-4 hours of 
voluntary parameters outside of the stand training session.  Total dai ly stimulation time will be 6-
10 hours. All stand training and ES sessions will be conducted in the laboratory. Approximately 
every 10 sessions the cardiovascular and voluntary sessions may be conducted in the laboratory  
(monitoring purposes, if necessary) . Then the final clinical and neurophysiological assessments 
will be conducted  (Post Stand Training) .

follow -up visit, the time the research participant used each program will be downloaded  from the 
stimulator . 
Cardiovascular Function (Specific Aim 1):  
Orthostatic Stress Test  (with and w ithout catecholamine blood draw)  will be assessed in the 
morning in a quiet, temperature -controlled (~22 C) room. After arriving, participants will be 
asked to empty their bladder before beginning the study. A butterfly catheter will be inserted into 
an an tecubital vein during instrumentation to allow the collection of blood without additional 
stress to the participant by [CONTACT_429600]. Continuous arterial BP will be acquired 
from a finger cuff placed around the ring, middle, index finger or th umb (Finapres Medical 
Systems). The hand will be placed in an arm sling and kept at the level of the heart throughout 
the study. Manual arterial blood pressure measurements will be taken throughout the study with 
a digital blood pressure measurement device  or via the auscultation method . A three  or twelve -
lead ECG (ML132, AD Instruments) will be placed for ECG monitoring. Rib cage and abdomen 
kinematics (respi[INVESTIGATOR_429530]) will be  acquired using an inductive plethysmograph. 
Baseline recording for [ADDRESS_543602] preparation. At the end of 15 -minute recording in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], participants will be 
passively moved into the upright seated position (tilt chair) or upright position (tilt tab le). This 
position will be maintained for [ADDRESS_543603] 
during standing, upright, sitti ng and supi[INVESTIGATOR_429531] 
a Finapres system as described above.  This assessment may be performed with and without 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473].  
 
Blood pressure lability: 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring (Specific Aim 1 ) and Heart Rate 
Variability : ECG Holter Monitor  
Continuous blood pressure monitoring will be recorded over a period of 24 hours outside the 
lab (Meditech ABPM, Budapest, Hungary). In regards to the severity of AD, the participant’s 
signs of OH (e.g. yawnin g, pallor) and subjective symptoms (e.g. light -headedness, dizziness) 
will also be assessed using validated autonomic questionnaires.  Continuous ECG  will be 
recorded over a period of at least 24 hours outside the lab with a 3,7 or 12 lead Holter monitor 
(EDAN Instruments, In c). 24-hour measurements will be repeated throughout the training 
interventions.    
 
Ultrasound: Measurements will be taken with and without epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473].  
Arterial Stiffness  (Specific Aim 1)  
Arterial Pulse Wave Velocity ( aPWV  m/s) will be measured non -invasively and  
calculated by [CONTACT_429601]. 
Distance between the arteri al measurement points  will be measured using measuring tape 
along the surface of the body, held pa rallel to the testing table. The pulse transit is 
determined from the arterial blood pressure waves, which are collected at each arterial site. 
A pen -like device (model SPT -301; Millar Instruments Inc., Houston,  TX) or Complior 
Page 11 of 30 
Version : 09/27/[ADDRESS_543604] and Central Press ure Analyzer (Alam Medical, Vincennes, [LOCATION_009]) sensors will 
be applied to the carotid , femoral , brachial and other  arterial sites using a light pressure to 
obtain arterial pressure waves. Heart rate will be recorded using a single -lead (lead I) 
electrocard iogram (ECG) (model ML 123, AD Instruments Inc., Colorado Springs, CO).  
Arterial structure: Wall thickness and lumen diameter (Specific Aim 1)  
Brachial and femoral arterial images will be collected using B -mode ultrasound for 10 
cardiac  cycles. Images will  be analyzed using internal ultrasound software to determine 
lumen diameter and intima -media thickness . 
Cardiac structure and function (Specific Aim 1)  
Cardiac images will be collected non -invasively using Doppler ultrasound (GE 
Healthcare or Philips Healt hcare) in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_429532]. Briefly, api[INVESTIGATOR_429533]-chamber views, and parasternal short and long -axis views will be collected and  stored 
on the ultrasound for offline analysis. Indices of interest will include but not limited to: 
volumes (end systolic (ESV), end diastolic (EDV), diameters (intraventricular septum 
systole (IVSs) and diastole (IVSd), left ventricular internal diameter systole (LVIDs)), 
systolic function (left ventricular posterior wall systole (LVIDd) and diastole (LVPWd), 
ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output (CO), fractional shortening, mitral regurgitation 
(dP/dT)) and diastolic function (E/A, E/e’ ratio, IVRT, DT).  
International Autonomic Standards Evaluation (Specific Aim 1)  
Until recently individuals with SCI were only examined with use of motor and sensory 
neurological standards in order to establish the level and the severity of the neurological 
impa irment or AIS (American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329248]) resulting from the 
SCI. During the last decade, International Autonomic standards for evaluation of individuals 
with SCI were developed and implemented around the world  (76). These short standardized 
forms collect data on cardiovascular (AD and OH) as well as other autonomic dysfunctions 
including bladd er bowel and sexual dysfunctions.  
Body Composition (Specific Aim 1)  
DXA : Weight, height, and total body fat will be determined from a dual energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Hologic QDR 4500W, APEX System Software Version 2.3) at 
Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], perf ormed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Waist circumference will be measured in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_429534] a normal expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], to the nearest 1cm midway between the lowest 
lateral border of the ribs and the uppermost lateral iliac crest. Waist circumference is c onsidered 
the most practical bedside measurement of visceral adipose tissue. Hip circumference will be 
measured supi[INVESTIGATOR_429535]. Waist/hip ratio and body 
mass index (measured weight in kilograms divided by [CONTACT_429602] [meters2]) will be 
calculated.  Total body fat will be reported as total body fat in kilograms, and as a percent of total 
body weight determined by [CONTACT_348211]. Height (length) will be measured using the electronic 
ruler function and weight from the DXA scan table scale feature. This is the preferred measure 
for assessing total body fat and has strong agreement with cadaver and chemical composition 
studies. Recent studies comparing DXA to CT and MRI have confirmed the validity and 
reliability of D XA to assess abdominal adiposity  [26]. In addition, its ease of use makes it ideal 
for  studying large populations. All scans will be performed with a (Hologic Discovery QDR 
4500W (Hologic Inc., Bedf ord, MA), which has an error of less than 1% for body fat scans. An 
experienced technician will conduct scans according established protocol. All participants will be 
scanned with this methodology to ensure high internal validity  (Intervention Protocol Ver sion 
2.0).

Version : 09/27/2017  BOD POD Body Composition:  
Procedure:  The BOD POD is an air displacement plethysmograph that measures body 
composition, fat mass, fat -free mass, thoracic gas volume, and estimates resting metabolic rate. 
Participants will be asked to sit in the scanner, remaining still during the t est. The full test requires 
only about 5 minutes and includes multiple short (about 40 seconds) volume calculations. The last 
scan for thoracic gas volume will only be conducted with individuals capable of holding the 
breathing tube to their mouth. Men wil l be asked to wear a form -fitting Lycra/spandex -type swim 
suit or single -layer compression shorts with no padding. Women will be asked to wear a form -fitting 
Lycra/spandex -type swim suit or single -layer compression shorts without padding and a single layer  
(not padded) sports bra.  Participants may be asked to repeat the procedure.  
Analysis: Body composition, fat mass and fat -free mass will be calculated by [CONTACT_429603]. Resting Metabolic Rate is estimated from the thoracic gas volume and the 
activity level that the research participant self -reports. The Brozek and Siri  models (based on sex 
and ethnicity) are standard with the software package . Additional models can be built into the 
software.  
Metabolic Parameters (Specific Aim 1)  
Blood draws : A trained technician will draw a venous blood sample. Participants will 
undergo a [ADDRESS_543605] the night before, including no food or drink including alcohol or 
caffeine (water is permitted). A complete blood count (white blood cells and differentials, 
erythrocytes, packed cell volume, hematocrit, platelets, hemoglobin and red cell indices) 
will be performed.  Blood glucose control (HbA1c), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 
atherogenic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (triglycerides, TC, LDL -c, HDL -c, TC/HDL -c), a pro -thromboti c 
state (PAI -1 and TAFI), a pro - inflammatory state (IL -6, and TNF -α), leptin, adrenal control 
(angiotensin, aldosterone and renin) will also be measured. Blood samples for PAI -1, TAFI, 
IL-6, and TNF -α will be analyzed using enzyme -linked immunosorbent ass ays (ELISA).  
Plasma levels of lipid and hemoglobin A1c will be analyzed through laboratory services 
using a Dade Behring RxL Max analyzer. This system has demonstrated very good intra and 
interassay reliability for lipid and glucose measures.  A comprehensi ve drug screen 
(urinalysis  or blood draw)  will be done to assess the use of combustible drugs (nicotine and 
other drugs that can be smoked)  
Aerobic Fitness Evaluation: Peak oxygen uptake test (VO2peak) (Specific Aim 1)  
Participants will perform an exercise  regimen. Participants will be asked to not perform 
any moderate or heavy exercise [ADDRESS_543606]. Resting ECG, blood pressure 
(DinamapCarescape V100; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, [LOCATION_006]) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_270023] 
(ParvomedicsTruemax 2400, Sandy,  UT, [LOCATION_003]) will be collected two minutes prior to 
exercise. Heart rate will also be monitored with a chest strap heart rate monitor (Polar T31 
heart rate monitor, Polar Electro Inc., Woodbury, NY, [LOCATION_003]). Continuous blood pressure 
and heart rate will also be measured using the Finapres acquisition described in the 
orthostatic stress test. Each participant will perform a graded exercise test (GXT) on a total 
body recumbent stepper (NuStep T4 ergometer, Ann Arbor, MI) to measure VO2max. For 
participants with tet raplegia who have limited handgrip function, tensor bandages will be 
used to secure hands to the ergometer handles. For those participants unable to perform the 
test on the NuStep, an arm ergometer test protocol will be administered [29, 53] . 
Participants will be instructed to maintain a cycling rate of 60 rev/min for the duration of the 
test. After an initial warm -up at 0W, power output will be increased at a rate of 5 W/min for 
Page 13 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  participants with tetraplegia, or 10 W/min for  participants with paraplegia, until volitional 
exhaustion (i.e. droppi[INVESTIGATOR_61217] 30 rev/min). Participants will be  asked to identify their 
ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) on the Borg scale every minute until the completion of 
exercise. Heart rate and ox ygen uptake will be recorded on a breath -by-breathe basis for the 
duration of the test. The highest [ADDRESS_543607] will be 
recorded as VO2peak.  
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)  (also called Resting Metabolic Rate – RMR)  (Speci fic Aim 1)  
BMR is the rate of energy expenditure by [CONTACT_429604] (reported as kilocalories). The 
release, and using, of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital 
organs: the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, int estine, sex organs, muscles, brain 
and skin. BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances when a person is awake, 
without moving or talking while the person is lying down in a best for about [ADDRESS_543608] calorimetry and will 
be analyzed with a Parvo Medic TrueOne 2400 (Sandy, UT). Analysis of the oxygen and 
carbon dioxide composition of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_429536] [ADDRESS_543609] 30 minutes before testing as  recommended by [CONTACT_3455]’s 
guidelines. An accurate BM R measurement requires that the person's sympathetic nervous 
system not be stimulated, thus, it requires complete rest. BMR generally decreases with age 
and with the decrease in lean body mass. Increases in muscle mass and mitochondrial 
proliferation (for example: as a result of endurance training) result in  increases in BMR.  
Pulmonary Function Test, PFT (Specific Aim 2):  PFT’s will be performed in the participant’s 
wheelchair using BreezeSuite System (MedGraphics , St. Paul, MN). Forced vital capacity (FVC) 
and forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV1) will be obtained. Three acceptable spi[INVESTIGATOR_429537] [67]. MP45 -36-871-350 
Differential Pressure Transducer (Validyne Engineering, Northridge, CA) will be used to 
measure the maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_429538]) and the maximum expi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y pressure 
(PEmax). The PI[INVESTIGATOR_429539]. The assessment will require a sharp, forc eful effort be maintained for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_543610] value that can be 
sustained for one second. The maximum value from three maneuvers that varied by [CONTACT_21316] 
20% will be averaged.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_429540] (RMCA)  (Specific Aim 2) : 
Procedure:  This assessment combines standard spi[INVESTIGATOR_429541] 
(as described in the Pulmonary Function Test /PFT/ section), 3 -lead Electrocardiography (ECG) 
(ML132, AD Instruments), beat -by-beat arterial Blood Pressure (BP) recordings from a finger 
cuff (Finapres Medical Systems), respi[INVESTIGATOR_429542] 
(lnductotrace, Ambulatory Monitoring), and  surface Electromyography (sEMG) (Motion Lab 
Systems, Inc, Baton Rouge, LA) of the muscles of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  This assessment may be 
performed with and without epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473].  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_429543] -related 
muscles using the MA300 System (Motion Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA) [68]. sEMG input 
will be amplified with a gain of 2000, filtered at 4 -1000 Hz and sampled at 2000 -[ZIP_CODE] Hz. The 
Page 14 of 30 
Version : 09/27/[ADDRESS_543611] with either 
Tegaderm Film (3M Req#1624W) or Cover -Roll Stretch Tape (BSN Medical, Hamburg, 
[LOCATION_013]).   The ground electrode(s) will be placed over the acromion process bilaterally.  
The RMCA will utilize a multi -muscle sEMG -based measure of motor output from the central 
nervous system recorded during voluntary tasks attempted in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_429544] [69, 
70].  The protocol begins in the seated position and consists of the following maneuvers followed 
by 5 minutes of relaxation in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], PEmax, PI[INVESTIGATOR_429538], PEmax and PI[INVESTIGATOR_429545] [ADDRESS_543612] resistance, shoulder 
shrug, hip and knee flexion, and a sit -up task.  sEMG of left and right neck, trunk, limb muscles 
including but not limited to submental, sternocleidomastoid, scalene, upper trapezius, lower 
trapezius, uppe r portion of pectoralis major, intercostals, the diaphragm, rectus abdominus, 
obliques, and the paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_429546] a multi -channel EMG system MA300 with 
pre-amplified electrodes (MotionLab Systems Inc., Baton Rouge, LA) or an Eclipse 
Neurol ogical Workstation (Axon Systems Inc., Hauppauge, NY) with pairs of recessed, FE9 
silver -silver chloride cap surface electrodes (Grass Instruments, W Warwick, RI).  
Analysis:  The envelope of EMG activity for each muscle will be calculated using a root mea n 
square (RMS) algorithm [69].  Analysis windows will be determined from the event marker 
recorded with the cuing tone that signaled the subject t o begin the task. The overall amount of 
EMG Magnitude (µV, Mag) and the Similarity Index (SI), that quantitate the multi -muscle 
distribution of activation during Maximum Expi[INVESTIGATOR_429547] (MEPT) in research 
participants compared to that of healthy s ubjects will be calculated using a vector -based analysis 
as previously described [69, 70] . In brief: multi -muscle activity parameters will be calculated 
using averaged RMS amplit udes from each SCI subject for comparison to group values from 
non-injured (NI) subjects. The resulting Mag parameter is the amount of combined sEMG 
activity during MEPT calculated as a length of the resultant vector. The SI provides a value 
between 0.0 an d 1.0 (most similar) equal to the cosine of the angle between the resultant multi -
muscle distribution vectors in SCI subject to that of NI subjects. To perform the maximum 
airway pressure tasks, subjects will produce maximum respi[INVESTIGATOR_429548] 5 secon ds blowing 
into the Airlife 001504 circuit (Allegiance Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, IL). Airway pressure; 
sEMG; breathing rate and chest wall kinematics will be monitored simultaneously by [CONTACT_429605] (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs , CO).  
For the bursts analysis, EMG data will be full wave rectified and filtered using a 4th order 
bandpass Butterworth filter (40 Hz - 500 Hz) representing the relative number and frequencies of 
the motor units recruited per burst. Integrated EMG will as sess the total EMG activity generated 
during specific phases of the motor tasks. Co -activation values of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_429549] -related oscillations will be evaluated 
through principal component a nalysis.  
 
EMG, kinematics and kinetics experiments (Specific Aim 3):  During the experiments, the 
research participants will be placed on the treadmill in an upright position and suspended by a 
cable in a harness (i.e. BWST) or on an overground standing device. Voluntary leg movements 
will be performed on a mat  or seated in  a chair . Following standard skin preparation techniques, 
bipolar surface EMG electrodes may be placed bilaterally on the  following muscles:  soleus 
(SOL), medial gastrocnemious (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial hamstrings (MH), quadriceps 
Page 15 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  (VL and RF) an d adductor (AD) muscles. Fine -wire EMG electrodes may be used for deep 
muscles of the hip and foot. Limb  and trunk  kinematics including hip, knee and ankle angles will 
be acquired using high speed passive marker motion capture (Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa,  CA). 
When appropriate we will measure individual ground reaction forces (GRF) using HRMat 
(TEKSCAN, [LOCATION_011], MA) or forces during movement with a force transducer (Kistler, Amherst, 
NY).  These experiments will be performed with and without epi[INVESTIGATOR_429550]. 
NeuroRecovery Assessment using EMG activity: Standing, Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Overground motor tasks : 
(Specific Aim 3)  
Procedure : Assess the level of muscle activation and amount of external assistance required 
during standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a body -weight supported treadmill environment, as well as 
overground motor tasks. Efficacy of arm, trunk and leg movement recovery and incorpo ration of 
independent motor tasks will be measured by [CONTACT_257141]  [71, 72] , comprised of fourt een motor tasks, 
and combined with EMG, kinematic, and kinetic analyses. This population has ongoing medical 
issues related to their spi[INVESTIGATOR_429551] e research participant. This will not affect the 
overall integrity of the data set. The research participant will be asked to perform these tasks as 
independently as possible with and without epi[INVESTIGATOR_429552] : EMG, kinematic, and kinetic analysis will be performed on the upper and lower 
extremities and/or trunk during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], standing, and overground motor tasks.  Muscle activation 
patterns will be evaluated using EMG that may include but is not limited to the following 
combinatio ns of muscles: sternocleidomastoid (SCM), upper trapezius (UT), biceps brachii (BB), 
triceps brachii (TB), extensor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778] (ECR), flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), abductor 
digiti quniti (ADQ), external intercostal (IC6 - 6th intercostal space), re ctus abdominus (RA), 
external oblique (EO), erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_268362] (ES), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), medial 
hamstrings (MH), adductor (AD), tibialis anterior (TA), peroneous longus (PL), medial 
gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), flexor hallucis brev is (FHB) or longus (FHL), extensor 
hallicus longus (EHL), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) using the MA300 System (Motion 
Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA). We may also use fine -wire EMG to acquire activity from the 
illio-psoas (IL), or other deep muscles, including the hand and feet muscles listed above. Standard 
needle insertion sites for each muscle will be used [73].  
EMG input will be amplified wi th a gain of 2000, filtered at [ADDRESS_543613] be prepared by [CONTACT_429606] a sterile 
alcoho l swab before electrode placement. The ground electrode(s) will be placed over a bony 
surface of the lower leg(s). Limb kinematics will include trunk, and upper and lower extremity 
angles that will be acquired using high speed passive marker motion capture  (Motion Analysis, 
Santa Rosa, CA). When appropriate, we will measure individual ground reaction forces (GRF) 
using a zebris FDM -T System (zebris Medical GmbH, Isny, [LOCATION_013]) or forces during movement 
with a force transducer (Kistler, Amherst, NY). Blood p ressure and heart rate may be measured 
using either a manual blood pressure monitor (Dinamap V100, GE Medical) or by a finger cuff 
(Finapres Medical Systems). Temperature may be monitored using a customized sensor system. A 
NIRS optode may be placed on a m uscle of the leg to measure muscle oxygenation and 
hemodynamics.  
The research participant will be asked to perform motor tasks as independently as possible. 
Research staff will score each of these tasks based on the algorithm. The following tasks may be 
performed in separate sessions (e.g. overground tasks, standing, or steppi[INVESTIGATOR_429553]).  
Page 16 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  Sit: The research  participant will be sitting unsupported at the edge of the therapy  mat with 
both feet touching the ground with hips and knees in 90-degree angles . The research staff will then 
ask the participant to sit without upper extremity  support to attain or maintain best posture. 
Depending on participant abilities, participant may be asked to maximally reach forward and to 
each side while maintaining appropriate posture and balance.  
Reverse Sit Up: From an unsupported sitting position at the edge of the mat with feet on the 
ground with hips and knees in 90 -degree angles,  the research participant will be asked to slowly

degrees. An empty 12 oz. can, will be placed on the table, arm’s length aw ay. The participant will 
be asked to reach forward, grab the can, bring it to their mouth, and set it back down on the table. 
As the patient progresses through the task with appropriate kinematics, they will be asked to 
perform the task with a full 12 oz. can. Each upper extremity will be performed and scored 
separately. Stability assistance can be given to the participant at the trunk, up to the level of the 
inferior borders of the scapulae while they are performing this task.  
Door Pull and Open: The part icipant will begin the task by [CONTACT_429609] [ADDRESS_543616] ers of the scapulae while 
they are performing this task.  
Page 17 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  Can Open and Manipulation: The participant will begin the task by [CONTACT_429610],  at the edge of the therapy  mat with both feet touching the ground with hips and knees in 
90-degree angles  and hands down by [CONTACT_198597]. A table will be placed in front of them with the 
height adjusted to be one inch below the wrist crease. The participant will be asked to 
simultaneously reach and place both hands around a container with a lid . As the participant 
progresses through the task with appropriate kinematics, they will be asked to perform more 
advanced skills, including stabilizing the can with one hand while using a lateral pi[INVESTIGATOR_429555]. There will be items in the can that the participant will be asked to remove 
and translate with the tips of their fingers. Each upper extremity will be performed and scored 
separately. Stability assistance can be given to the participant at the trunk, up to the level of the 
inferior borders of the scapulae while they are performing this task.  
Sit to Stand: The research participant will be asked to stand up from a seated position at the 
edge of the mat, with hips and knees in 90 -degree angles,  without the ass istance of his/her arms. If 
the participant is able to raise his body 50% off the mat, the research staff will assist as needed 
during the latter 50% of standing. Depending on participant abilities, participant may be asked to 
stand up while holding 20 pounds and to stand up from a seated position with hips at 100 -degree 
flexion angles.  
Stand: The research participant will be asked to stand overground with proper posture. 
Assistance will be provided by [CONTACT_429611]. Depending on participant abilities, 
participant may be asked to reach maximally reach forward and laterally, achieve and maintain 
tandem stance, and achieve and maintain single -limb stance while maintaining proper posture and 
balance.  
Walking: From a standing position, the research participant will be asked to shift weight 
laterally and forward while in a stride position. Assistance will be provided by [CONTACT_429612]. Depending on participant abilities, participant may be asked to take repetitive steps, 
step over an object, descend an incline, complete a pi[INVESTIGATOR_429556] 10 
meters while maintaining proper posture and balance.  
Stand Adaptability: From a standing position over a treadmill with overhead body weigh t 
support, the research participant will be asked to maintain best posture without use of upper 
extremity support. The research staff will assist only as needed at body segments not being 
assessed. Body weight support will then be lowered until the researc h participant can no longer 
maintain proper posture without assist. Depending on participant abilities, participant may be 
asked to resist perturbations at the trunk with body weight support less than 20%, perform squats, 
and maintain single -limb stance al l while maintaining proper posture and balance with body 
weight support less than 10%.  
Step Retraining: From a standing position over a treadmill with overhead body weight 
support, the research participant will be asked to maintain proper posture and natur al arm swing 
while the research staff assists him/her to walk at speeds of 2.[ADDRESS_543617] to maintain proper steppi[INVESTIGATOR_429557]. Body weight support will then be 
lowered until the research participate is unable to maintain proper posture and/or the research staff 
are unable to maintain proper steppi[INVESTIGATOR_429557]. Depending on participant abilities, participant 
may be asked to step over objects, adjust to varying random treadmill speeds, and achieve a 
running patt ern all while maintaining proper posture, with support from research staff to maintain 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_429557], at various levels of body weight support. We may step continuously for up to 
10 minutes.  
Step Adaptability:  From a standing position over a treadmil l with overhead body weight 
support, the research participant will be asked to maintain proper posture and natural arm swing 
while walking at speeds of 0.[ADDRESS_543618] to provide proper 
Page 18 of 30 
Version : 09/27/[ADDRESS_543619] to varying random 
treadmill speeds, and achieve a running pattern all while maintaining proper posture and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_429558].  
Analysis : Based on the performance across categories, [ADDRESS_543620] rectified 
and filtered using a 4th order bandpass Butterworth filter (40 Hz - 500 Hz) representing the relative 
number and frequencies of the motor units recruited per burst. Integrated EMG will assess the total 
EMG activity generated during specific phases of the motor tasks. Co -activation values of agonists 
and antagonist muscles and the degree of coordination in the movements will be evaluated thro ugh 
principal component analysis.  
 
MG and Soleus H -reflex (Specific Aim 4):  All EMG data will be collected at 2000 Hz with 
custom -written acquisition software (National Instruments, Austin, TX, [LOCATION_003]). We will record 
bilateral EMG (Motion Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA, [LOCATION_003]) from same muscles as above. The 
soleus H -reflex will be evoked by [CONTACT_429613] a 1 -ms pulse, generated by a constant current stimulator (DS7A, 
Digitimer, [LOCATION_006]) and  will be recorded by [CONTACT_429614]. A minimum 10 control and conditioned reflexes will be recorded in every trial. 
The indifferent electrode will be placed above the patella for selective stimulatio n of the nerve 
trunk. The EMG signal will be amplified and band -pass filtered (10 Hz -500 Hz) before being 
sampled at 2 kHz (1401 plus running Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] 2 software). The digitized EMG signals will be 
rectified and the size of M -wave and H -reflex responses will be measured as the area under the 
full-rectified waveforms. Soleus H -reflexes will be recorded as designated by [CONTACT_429615][INVESTIGATOR_429559] (described in detail below). For all conditioning experiments, 
amplitude and latency changes of the s oleus H -reflex will be used to quantify the effects of the 
TMS, galvanic, auditory or ulnar nerve stimulation. Control H -reflexes will be evoke d 
interleaved with those conditioned by [CONTACT_429616].  
Corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_61569] (Specific Aim 4):  We w ill administer single pulse transmagnetic 
stimulation using a Magstim 200 single -pulse stimulator with a double cone coil for activating 
lower extremity musculature while the research participants are in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. We will 
position the coil appro ximately 0 -2 cm anterior to the vertex to locate the hotspot left and right 
tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscles. We will position the coils tangentially to the scalp with 
intersection of both wings at 45 degrees to midline for optimal motor cortex sti mulation. We will 
use Signal software (Cambridge electronic design, [LOCATION_006]) to trigger motor evoked potential (MEP) 
data acquisition. We will perform MEP data analysis using Signal software (Cambridge 
electronic design, [LOCATION_006]). Mean peak -to-peak MEP amplitudes (a verage of 8 -10 trials) at intensities 
10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% above rMT will be used to generate stimulus 
response curves. Using SigmaPlot curve -fitting software, stimulus response curves will be fitted 
with the Boltzmann function: MEPa= P/1+e xp ((I50 -I)/k), where P is the Plateau amplitude, I is 
the intensity, I50 is the amplitude at 50% of plateau and k is slope parameter of the steepest 
portion of the curve.  
Page 19 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  Research participants will be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_103645] a fixed hip, knee and joint angle. For 
those individuals who can maintain a voluntary contraction, an additional series of tests will be 
conducted with background EMG activity. For soleus H -reflex modulation single pulses will be 
used to condition the H -reflex induced by [CONTACT_429617] 0 and 100 s (see 8,33,61,68). We will measure the MEP’s in response 
to incrementing levels of TMS over the leg area of the primary motor cortex and generate 
recruitment curves. We will measu re changes in threshold, slope and the maximum amplitude of 
the recruitment curve to determine if severity of injury, time since injury, or locomotor training 
influences the excitability or functional connectivity of the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_429560]. We will als o 
compare the reproducibility of these parameters in non -disabled research  participants to verify 
these changes are not attributed to inherent variability of the measurements. We will calculate 
peak -to-peak values for the MEP response and those responses a t a given stimulation frequency 
will be averaged and plotted versus the stimulation intensity. If  background EMG is elicited we 
will average the amplitude from a 25 ms window prior to stimulation.  
Vestibulospi[INVESTIGATOR_429560]  (Specific Aim 4):  We will administer galvanic stimulation (rectangular 
pulses, 300 ms, 2 -4.5 mA) with Digitimer DS5 Isolated Bipolar Constant Current Stimulator 
using 2.5 cm diameter electrodes placed over the mastoid processes for the assessment of the 
vestibulospi[INVESTIGATOR_429561]. The digitimer will be externally triggered by [CONTACT_429618] H -Reflex. The research participants will be lying with the head 
of the mat fixed (30 degrees) because posture influences the responses. Control H -reflexes will 
be evoked interleaved with those conditioned by [CONTACT_429619] [ADDRESS_543621] (Specific Aim 4):  The reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_429562] H -reflex amplitude under conditioning stimulation via auditory stimulus (30 ms tone of 90 
dB at 700 Hz) that will be d elivered using binaural earphones. EMG will be recorded from the 
sternocleidomastoid muscle to confirm the startle response (10). The soleus H -reflex will be 
elicited 50 ms after the sound to peak after 75 -125 ms and return to baseline values after 250 ms  
(24). Amplitude changes of the soleus H -reflex will be used to quantify the effects of the 
auditory stimulation. Control H -reflexes will be evoked interleaved with those conditioned by 
[CONTACT_429620] a time separation of at least [ADDRESS_543622]  (Specific Aim 4):  The long propriospi[INVESTIGATOR_429563] g soleus H -reflex amplitude under conditioning stimulation of the ipsilateral  
ulnaris  nerve at the wrist joint via surface electrodes with trains of 3 rectangular pulses (pulse 
duration:  0.5 ms, pulse interval: 3 ms) (20,47). The soleus H -reflex will be el icited [ADDRESS_543623] M response of the abductor pollicis  brevis muscle. The stimulus will be 
applied every 3 s in a randomized, inte rleaved conditioned and unconditioned stimuli sequences.  
Somatosensory Evoked Potential:  
Page 20 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  Procedure: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) - Somatosensory evoked potentials are 
recorded through surface electrodes to measure conduction in the peripheral ner ves, cervical and 
lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], deep brain structures, and sensory cortex  (Asanuma [ADDRESS_543624] and tibial nerve of the right and left upper and lower 
limbs. Ground electrodes are placed on the forearms and thighs. Repeated single -pulse electrical 
stimulation is delivered at intensities of 1 and 1.5 times motor thres hold for the recorded muscles 
for each of the four nerves evaluated. Averaged responses for up to 256 stimuli will be recorded 
for each of these two intensities for the right and left median and tibial nerves. Simultaneous 
bilateral stimulation will be app lied if no recognizable responses are recorded from the scalp leads. 
Stimulation delivery rates will not exceed 2 per second.  
Analyses: Average latencies will be calculated for N20 & P23 peaks for the Median nerve and N45 
& P37 peaks for the Tibial nerve u sing Natus (Viking).The peak to peak amplitude can also be 
calculated using Natus (Viking).  
 
Sympathetic Skin Responses (SSR):  
Procedure:  Sympathetic skin responses (SSR): The SSR will be elicited by [CONTACT_429621] -
orbital, median and/or tibial nerves, and recorded bilaterally and simultaneously from both hands 
and feet to assess the extent of disruption to spi[INVESTIGATOR_429564]. Five to ten electrical 
stimuli (duration 0.2 ms; intensity 3 -60mA) will be applied Supra orbital nerve, the median nerve 
and posterior tibial nerve, in random order and with variable and long -time delays to minimize 
habituation.  
Analysis:  The SSR recordings are among the frequently utilized techniques for the evaluation of 
integrity and functional capacity of the autonomic circuits after SCI [74-77]. The outcomes will be 
calculated as a number of recognizable responses out of 10 stimulations, and averaged latency and 
averaged amplitude [78]. 
 
Interventions : 
1) ES Cardiovascular Parameters during sitting or lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
2) ES Voluntary Parameters during voluntary leg movement training  
3) ES Stand Parameters during stand training  overground or on BWST  
c.     Significance . The prognosis for those who suffer a  devastating spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] 
(SCI) that results in complete paral ysis, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and bladder dysfunction is 
extremely poor. The combined medical and personal economic impact of these complications of 
the average spi[INVESTIGATOR_429565], with an 
estimated 1,275,000 Americans with a SCI (1). The current paradigm is to provide compensatory 
therapeutic interventions which focuses on improved function above the lesion, with the singular 
hope that in the future some regenerative approach, perhaps using stem cell  technologies, will 
reach clinical trials; because, it is thought that reestablishing anatomical connectivity of 
supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_429566]. In this proposal, we challenge 1) the concep t that movement and autonomic function 
can only be restored by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -establishing anatomical connections from supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_429567] 21 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  neurons; and 2) that those with the diagnosis of clinically motor complete SCI indicates a 
prognosis of essentially no recovery . Individuals with complete motor paralysis suffer from a 
myriad of complications that result in mortality, morbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], high burden of care 
and health care costs and a drastically lowered quality of life.  
d. Human Subjects  
Human Subjects Invol vement and Characteristics : There are approximately 1,275,000  
Americans with a SCI. Fifty -six percent of the injuries occur i n people aged 16 to 30, with an 
average age of 31, and 82% of the total population are male. Minorities make up 38% of SCI 
cases an d while every effort will be made to recruit minorities, based on the incidence rates, their 
participation may be limited. Every effort will be made to recruit women, though only about  
18% of SCI patients are female. Although many people have secondary hea lth issues after SCI, 
such as spasticity and frequent urinary tract infections, they are otherwise healthy individuals. 
Standing and activity dependent training is considered beneficial for people with SCI, who are 
otherwise confined to a wheelchair, as im mobilization can contribute to secondary pathologies 
such as osteoporosis, leg muscle contractures, decreased cardiovascular health, pressure sores 
and muscle atrophy. Pregnant women with SCI will not be studied because the risks to the fetus 
are unknown. No other vulnerable subjects will be included.  
We will enroll five research participants who have sustained a SCI (AIS A , B or C ) to 
participate in the proposed experiments. Frazier Rehab Institute evaluates approximately [ADDRESS_543625] in participating in our research programs.  
All  research  participants,  irrespective of  gender,  will  be selected  based  on  the  following  
Inclusion criteria .   
1)  non -progressive  SCI  with  motor  paralysis  above  T1;  American  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_429568] (AIS) A, B o r C; 2) 21 – 70 years of age;  3) greater than [ADDRESS_543626] injury; 4) stable medical condition; 5) unable  to voluntarily move all single joints of the 
legs;  6) cardiovascular dysfunction incl uding presence of persistent  resting low blood pressures 
and/or symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and/or orthostatic hypotension; 7) respi[INVESTIGATOR_429569] 15% deficit in predicted pulmonary function outcomes; and 8) 
presence of functional segmental reflexes.  
Exclusion criteria:  
1) ventilator dependent; 2) painful musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, severe 
contracture, or untreated pressure  sore/wound  that might interfere with training; 3) untreated 
psychiatric disorders; 4)  ongoing drug abuse; 5) cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], bladder, or renal 
disease unrelated to SCI; 6) severe anemia (Hgb<8 g/dl) or hypovelemia; 7) HIV or AIDS 
related illn ess (self-reported or based on chart review) ; 8) ongoing use of combustible drugs (e.g. 
Nicotine  and illicit: meth amphet amine, marijuana, cocaine, etc); and 9) unable to wean off from  
anti-spasticity medications.  
Each research particip ant will be screened for  medical eligibility by a neurosurgeon and 
physiatrist  and for scientific eligibility by [CONTACT_388648]. After eligibility is 
determined and consent procedures are implem ented, the individual will  undergo clinical and 
neurophysiological assessments for volunt ary movement, cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2606]. Random dr ug testing  will be conducted throu ghout the  study to verify the particip ant is 
abstaining  from the use  of nicotine  and other  combusti ble drug products. 
Page 22 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  During the experimental stand  session,  particip ants will use an overground standing  device 
or will  be placed on the treadmill  in an upright position  and suspend ed in a harness by [CONTACT_429622].  A trainer posi tioned behind the participant  will aid in pelvis and trunk  stabil ization. 
The t rainer will ensure that  the trunk  and pelvis are not flexed or hyper-extended during  
standi ng. Trainer(s) positioned at the lower limb will provide  manu al facilitation using  a 
customized technique  developed  by [CONTACT_429623]. 
Trainer(s) promote knee extension  by [CONTACT_429624].  Manual facilitation  at  the  trunk-pelvis  and  at  the  legs  
will  be  used  only  when  needed. For those p articip ants trained on the body weight support  
system, the body weight support  (BWS) will be continuous ly reduced over the course  of the 
training sessions  as the subjects increase their ability to bear weight on the lower limbs.  Manual 
facilitation will be reduced with indep endence of standin g. Assessment of standi ng, EMG  
activity, kinem atics and kinetics  during standi ng, pulmon ary and volunt ary function will be 
conducted prior to the onset of training and after approximately 4 months  (80 s essions) of  each 
intervention  
Experimental testing, electrode  implant ation and subsequ ent training interventions  will be 
initiated after the subject has been evaluated and the research team has determin ed complian ce 
with the selection criteria. Maxwell Boakye, MD, Joseph Neimat, MD  or Camilo Castillo , MD 
will compl ete a medi cal history and neurological examination to determine  medi cal eligibility for  
each SCI subject. Susan  Harkema,  PhD  will  determine  study  eligibility  based  on  the  inclusion  
and exclusion criteria and by [CONTACT_429625]. Boayke and [CONTACT_113600] . 
Experimental testing and training interventions will be initiated after the subject has been evaluated 
and determined in compliance with the selection criteria. The subjects will not be concurrently 
enrolled in any other experimental studies  unless approved by [CONTACT_473] . All subjects will 
sign an inform ed consent that has been approved by [CONTACT_429626] 
(IRB) prior to entering the study. Each subject will be assigned a subject identification number to 
designate all evaluations.  
Sources of Materials : Data obtained will be utili zed specifically for research and teaching 
purposes only. Members of the research team including research assistants, post -doctoral 
students and graduate students will have access to the materials for analyses. Only [CONTACT_429638] 
will have access to the codi ng of the identification number to the research participants.  
Potential Risk:  
Risk from Surgery and Implantation of Neurostimulator : The surgical procedure 
performed to implant the 5 -6-5 Specify or Specify 5 -6-5 SureScan MRI electrode, 
(MEDTRONIC, Minneapolis, MN, [LOCATION_003]) and RestoreAdvanced  or Restore  Advance d SureScan 
MRI Pulse generator, (MEDTRONIC, Minneapolis, MN, [LOCATION_003]) involves minima l risk.  Both 
devices are  FDA a pproved and meet US safety  regulations. The patient will be apprised of the 
surgical risks by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Boakye  or [CONTACT_429639] . As with any routine surgical intervention there is a 
risk of bleeding and infection. Other potential risks  of this procedure involve: 1) development of 
scar tissue around the electrode; 2) epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865]; 3) seroma; 4) hematoma; 5) CSF leak; 
and 6) skin erosion. Some complication s such as lead migration and breakage of electrode or 
hardware could require follow up surgery. The subjects will be monitored postoperatively and 
will stay overnight at University of Louisville  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . The patient will be followed during that 
period by [CONTACT_6283]. Boakye , Neimat  or Castillo  to monitor any complications of surgery.  
Page 23 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  Risk from Interventions and Experimental Procedures:  
Stand and/or Voluntary Interventions : Because subjects must meet the criteria listed above, 
we expect that all subjects will be in good health. The studies described may involve the 
following physical risks and/or discomforts: 1) increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_429570]; 2)  
increased heart rate; 3) muscle and joint soreness; 4) lowering or elevation of blood pressure; 5) 
dizziness; 6) skin irritation from recording electrodes or hand placements of trainer s; 7) skin 
abrasion from hand placements of trainers; 8) chest pain; 9) muscle strain or joint sprain from 
weight -bearing due to standing or steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or the force exerted by [CONTACT_200857]; and 10) fracture 
from weight -bearing due to standing or the force e xerted by [CONTACT_200857].  
Most subjects will have increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_429571]. 
However, we do not expect the increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_429572] e. Many SCI subjects will likely  sustain skin 
irritation from the recording electrodes or hand placements of the trainers. These conditions are 
considered to be minimal risks and are reversible.  
There  is  some  chance  that  subjects  may  sustain  muscle   and  joint  soreness,  lowering  
or elevation of blood pressure, dizziness or skin abrasion from hand placements of the trainers. If 
these events occur, stand training and the experiment would cease immediately. [CONTACT_113600]  will 
be alerted if the condit ion persists. These conditions are considered to be minimal risks and are 
reversible.  
It is highly unlikely that a subject would feel chest pain or high blood pressure would occur 
that did not resolve within several minutes.  These events have not occurred in our past  
experience. However, if this did occur the individual would be immediately transported to the 
respective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Emergency Unit and [CONTACT_113600]  will be notified. It is also highly unlikely 
that  a  subject  would  suffer  a  muscle  strain,   joint  sprain  or  fracture  from  standing.  These 
conditions are considered to be moderate risks but rarely occur. However if these events should 
occur,  the  subject  would  immediately  stop  stand  training  and  would  be  evaluated  by  [INVESTIGATOR_124].  
Castill o. Standard medical procedures will be provided. The subject’s primary physician would 
be notified as needed. These conditions are considered to be moderate risks and are reversible.  
Stimulation parameters used during training will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_5051]. 
Subjects will undergo training about stimulator use at each site. Testing of optimal stimulation 
parameters and ranges will be performed in the laboratory to make sure stimulation is safe for the 
subject. Stimulation programs given to ea ch participant will be restricted to those used and tested 
in the laboratory. Subjects will be instructed to call the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] , nurse  or assigned research team 
member immediately if complications from stimulation develop  during home training programs. 
[CONTACT_113600]  will be notified as needed.  
If serious adverse effects such as autonomic dysreflexia, sustained elevation or reduction in 
blood pressure,  or bradycardia or tachycardia have recurring onset on an individual or become 
present  across  the  tested sample population the research team will evaluate the  stimulation 
protocol. Stimulation parameters will be assessed initially limiting the voltage and frequency as 
well as selecting more localized configuration patterns that could reduce such effects. If a serious 
adverse event occurs as a result of stimulation, the research participant will be required to train in 
the laboratory for at least a week where they can be monitored by [CONTACT_3647]. They will not be 
allowed to return to a home based stimulatio n program until they show stable responses to the 
stimulation and have been cleared by a physician. If stimulation parameters cannot be found to 
eliminate the onset of adverse effects the study will be stopped.  
Orthostatic Stress Test : While undergoing thi s test, participants may experience dizziness, 
changes in blood pressure and heart rate or shortness of breath. Each participant will be closely 
Page 24 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  monitored for any drastic changes in the recordings of their blood pressure, heart rate or 
breathing or show vi sible flushing of their cheeks or face.  
Blood Catecholamines : Though venipuncture is routinely done and relatively safe, participants 
may experience a feeling of light -headedness, bruising, Hematoma (blood  accumulating under 
the skin), pain and/or infection. Participants will be monitored for any adverse effects or acute 
cases of the specified risks.  
Pulmonary function tests : During testing, every research participant will be slowly acclimated to 
the equipment to make him/her feel comfortable. This will help the research participants avoid 
experiencing a lowered blood pressure or dizziness. Each participant will be closely monitored 
for blood pressure and heart rate throughout each sEMG recording. Testing will immediately 
cease if these values become  abnormal or if the research participant feels tired, winded or has 
chest pain. If these conditions persist, [CONTACT_113600]  will be immediately contact[CONTACT_429627]. Before and after eve ry 
sEMG recording, the participant’s skin will be examined for irritations and abrasions. If skin 
irritations or abrasions are caused by [CONTACT_429628], placement will be modified  
appropriately.  
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Peripheral Ne rve Stimulation : There are no known 
significant risks with this procedure at this time, because the magnetic fields at the strengths used 
are thought to be without harm. The exception is if you have a cardiac pacemaker, or a certain 
type of metallic clip i n your body (i.e., an aneurysm clip in your brain). There are no known 
long-term adverse effects reported with the use of this device; however, this test is still under 
development. There may be unforeseen risks in the long -term that are currently unknown.  The 
TMS device produces a loud clicking sound.  Although studies have found no hearing 
impairments as a result of this sound, some subjects experience a mild temporary effect on their 
hearing. To minimize this possibility, participants will be given prote ctive earplugs. In patients 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], activation of the brain could also activate a seizure. Patients with stroke can also 
develop seizures due to the brain scar. Therefore, magnetic stimulation of the brain could 
conceivably activate a seizure in a s troke survivor with such a scar. There may be slight 
discomfort associated with the electrical stimulation. If this becomes uncomfortable, stimulat ion 
will be reduced or stopped.  
There are no identifiable psychological, sociological, economical or legal ri sks to the 
participants.  
Adequacy of Protection against Risk:  
Recruitment and Informed Consent : The research  team will utilize the Human  Locomotion 
Research Center’s Potential Volunteer Database (UofL Study #06.0647)  to search for potential 
research volunteers for any  of our current research studies based  on eligibility criteria (e.g. level 
of injury, cause  of injury, etc.). Participants will be screened through IRB #07.[ADDRESS_543627]. Harkema (Loui sville) 
and/or designated research staff. Afterwards, all potential  subjects will be encouraged to read the 
informed consent and discuss the study with their physician, family and friends, before signing 
the IRB approved informed consent. The informed cons ent will be written in language that an 
eighth -grade student would be able to understand and will contain information on all studies to 
be performed as well as contact [CONTACT_429629]/her associates should have any 
Page 25 of 30 
Version : 09/27/[ADDRESS_543628]. Harkema’s 
office. If a participant is employed by [CONTACT_2374], we will review and discuss a risk 
management plan.    The plan will be signed by [CONTACT_093], participant and witnessed by a n 
individual outside of the study and department to ensure there is no coercion. A copy of the plan 
will be provided to the participant and placed in his employee file.  
Protection against Risk : To protect confidentiality, each research participant will be 
assigned a coded identification number with no association to their identity. This number will 
distinguish all evaluations and analyses. Data will be stored on computer media and video and 
will be secured in a locked storage area of the laboratory. Only me mbers of the research team 
including research assistants, post -doctoral students and graduate students will have access to the 
data for analyses. [CONTACT_429638] will have access to the coding of the identification number to the 
research participants. No indiv idual will be allowed to participate in the study without being 
examined by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Castillo . All eligible research participants will be encouraged to discuss the 
study with their primary physician, in order to minimize physical risks. To further minimize 
risks, the following precautions will be taken:  
Stimulation : Every research participant will be slowly acclimated to stimulation. This may 
help  the   research  participants  avoid  experiencing  significant  blood  pressure  fluctuations  or  
dizziness. However, if these conditions should occur, stimulation will be modified or stopped, 
depending on the need to regulate the blood pressure. Each research  participant will be closely 
monitored (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate) throughout stimulation sessions in the 
lab. Stimulation will immediately cease if these values become abnormal or if the research 
participant feels tired, winded or has chest pain. If these conditions persist, [CONTACT_113600]  will be 
contact[CONTACT_429630]. [CONTACT_429638] and the research team will continually assess the appropriate stimulation 
parameters including configurations, voltage and frequency.  
Orthostatic Stress Test, Pulmonary function tests, EMG Experiments : Participants will be 
continuously monitored for any signs of risks or discomfort. If these occur the recording or 
training session  will be immediately discontinued. If any complications arise, the training will 
immediately stop and [CONTACT_113600]  will immediately be informed. He or a designated associate 
will be available on campus during all data collections. In addition, the particip ant’s primary care 
provider will be notified as necessary. Reports of symptoms associated with infection will be 
addressed immediately and the participant’s primary care provider will be notified as necessary.  
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Peripher al Nerve Stimulation : Both during and in 
the days following the procedure, participants will be monitored for excessive discomfort, 
headaches and other adverse reactions. Reports of symptoms associated with seizures will be 
addressed immediately and the pa rticipant’s primary care provider will be notified as necessary.  
 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been chartered to monitor the 
safety of research participants as well as the validity and data integrit y of studies conducted at 
the Kentucky Spi[INVESTIGATOR_429573], University of Louisville and the Frazier 
Rehab Institute. Members of the DSMB serve in an individual capacity and will convene yearly 
to provide their expertise including recommenda tions regarding the continuation, modification, 
or termination of any or all phases of a study. The DSMB will review cumulative study data to 
evaluate safety, study conduct, scientific validity and data integrity. DSMB members may review 
current versions o f the protocol and Informed Consent Form, and any subsequent amendments to 
ensure an understanding of a study’s objectives and design. Day -to-day oversight of the study 
will be provided by [CONTACT_5844]. They will review all study data and an y adverse 
events, and report all adverse events to the University of Louisville, IRB, DSMB chairperson and 
Page 26 of 30 
Version : 09/27/2017  sponsor as appropriate. Medical events that occur while the research participants are engaged in 
the research protocols also will be logged by a rese arch nurse, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], physicians 
and/or staff. Any adverse events (AE) are collected on an Adverse Event Form and will be 
reported at the yearly DSMB meeting. An AE report will be generated for each event and will 
include a description of the ev ent, when and how it was reported, as well as any official chart 
records or documentation to corroborate the event and a determination of attribution. Any AE 
that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_429574], probably, or possibly related to the research interventio n, 
or serious in nature, and unexpected will be reported to the IRB, within 5 business days of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_429575]. Any unanticipated problems involving risks to research 
participants or others will include a corrective plan and measures to prevent reoccurrence. Such 
events will be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies as required within 5 business days of 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_429575].

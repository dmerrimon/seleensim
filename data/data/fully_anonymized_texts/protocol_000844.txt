Date 10 October 2017
3 (138)Synopsis and Section 8.2: The sample size text was modified to reflect the changes in cohort 
enrollment (minimum of 30 subjects, maximum of 90 subjects per cohort). 
Synopsis and Section 9.3: The anticipated enrollment duration was reduced from 30 months to 
approximately 20 months.
Section 3.5, Section 4.1, and Section 5.6.1: The protocol was revised to state that prior to any 
cohorts being closed to enrollment, subjects may enroll in the study and initiate treatment prior to 
the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx®and myChoice®homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)
tests being reported; however, subjects will not be allocated into a cohort until the results are 
received by [CONTACT_737]. Once the test results are received by [CONTACT_737], the subject will 
be allocated into the appropriate cohort.  Once a cohort reaches 90 subjects, the cohort will be closed, and subjects may not initiate treatment until their Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx
®and 
myChoice®HRD tests are completed, the results are received by [CONTACT_737], and it is confirmed 
an open-cohort is available for which the subject is eligible.
Section 4, Table 4, Section 4.1, Section 5.6.1: A pre-s creening option was added. The Myriad 
testing may be submitted in advance of the 28-day screening window if the subject consents to the 
appropriate pre-screening informed consent form.
Table 4, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.5, Section 5.6.1, Section 5.6.5, Table 6, and Section 8.4.6: 
Collection of mandatory blood samples for circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid analysis was 
added at baseline and disease progression. 
Section 3.9, Section 4, Section 4.2.5, and previous S ection 4.3.1: The text was revised and deleted as 
necessary to clarify that subjects must be discontinued from the active study treatment phase if they 
have objective radiological disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors v1.1. 
Section 4.3.2: Text was modified to clary that follow-up after the final data cut-off refers to the final 
data cut-off for the primary endpoint analysis.
Section 1.4 and Section 5.6.1: It was clarified that additional tumor samples (10 to 20 slides) will 
also be collected for a mandatory tumor biopsy at screening and at objective radiological disease 
progression, if there is a tumor that can be biopsied and it is not clinically contraindicated.
Section 8.5.4, An informal interim analysis was added. The informal interim analysis in each cohort 
will take place after [ADDRESS_1273698] 
6 months of the study. If no responses (CR or PR) are observed in the first [ADDRESS_1273699] been completed and a decision is made by [CONTACT_121158]. Additionally annual updates of relevant study data may be generated for the purpose of reporting at 
appropriate oncology conferences, as specified in the statistical analysis plan.

Sections 1.1, 1.2 , 1.2.1, 1.3.2, and [IP_ADDRESS]: Text was updated to reflect the approval of the olaparib 
tablet formulation, as well as results from Study 19 and SOLO-2, as appropriate. 
Section 3.8.2 and Appendix E: The duration of contraception requirements was clarified and 
language was modified to clarify the contraception requirements should be started from the signing of informed consent. 
Section 4.2.5 and Table 6 (Study Plan): The visit window for the study discontinuation visit was 
corrected from ± 7 days to + 7 days. 
Appendix E: Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods were clarified. The definition of 
abstinence was modified to “Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods include: Total/True abstinence: When the subject refrains from any form of sexual intercourse and this is in line with 
their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total duration of the trial and for at 
least [ADDRESS_1273700] dose of study drug. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, or declaration of abstinence solely for the duration of a trial) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception;” from “Acceptable 
Non-hormonal birth control methods include: Total sexual abstinence.  Abstinence must continue 
for the total duration of study treatment and for at least [ADDRESS_1273701] dose for female subjects.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar ovulation, symptothermal post-ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.” 
Table 6 (Study Plan) and Section [IP_ADDRESS]: The pregnancy testing requirements were modified to add 
testing at Day 29 and at regular intervals (monthly).

Study design
This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized , multi-center study assessing the efficacy and 
safety of olaparib tablets [ADDRESS_1273702] 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.  
The study will assess the effectiveness of  olaparib tablets as measured by [CONTACT_799241] (ORR) as determined by [CONTACT_864745] e Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) v1.1, in subjects with ger mline BRCA mutations (gBRCAm), somatic BRCA 
mutations (sBRCAm), or potential aberrations in homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD) as determined by [CONTACT_907363]®HRD, as well as in subjects without identifiable HRD.  
This study will utilize Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx®for germline BRCA analysis and a tumor 
test (myChoice®HRD) for tumor BRCA analy sis and HRD status.  Note: The Myriad testing 
may be submitted in advance of the 28-day screening window if the subject consents to the 
appropriate pre-screening informed consent form.
Four cohorts will be identified based upon the genetic testing described above:
# Cohort 1: gBRCAm,
# Cohort 2: s BRCAm and germlin e BRCA wild type,  
# Cohort 3: m yChoice®HRD positive (genomic instability positive) and 
BRCA wild type (BRCAwt) (no BRCA mutation),  
# Cohort 4: m yChoice®HRD negative (genomic instability negative) and 
BRCAwt (no BRCA mutation).

24 (138)BRCA and HRD
Numerous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) single-stranded breaks (SSBs) occur naturally as the 
result of normal metabolic activities and environmental factors, including ultraviolet light and radiation. Polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose (poly [ADP ribose]) polymerase (PARP) plays an 
important role in identifying and repairing SSBs. PARP inhibition is an approach to targeting 
tumors with deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms.  PARP enzymes are essential for 
repairing DNA SSBs.  Inhibiting PARPs leads to the persistence of SSBs, which are then 
converted to the more serious DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) during the process of 
DNA replication.  Olaparib, through direct PARP enzyme inhibition and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_907353], prevents repair of SSBs. As cells undergo replication, 
SSBs are converted to harmful DSBs. In norm al cells, DSBs are repaired by a DNA repair 
mechanism called homol ogous recombination repair (HRR). Cells with homologous 
recombination deficiency (HRD), resort to the more error prone repair mechanism called 
non-homologous end joining. In cells with HRD, DNA damage accumulates and leads to high 
genomic instab ility and eventual cell d eath. Cancer with HRD would t hus be more sensitive to 
induction of cell death by [CONTACT_546766] ( Farmer et al 2005, McCabe et al 2006 ).
The most common function-altering mutations  associated with HRD are a mutation in the 
breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 , which encode for [ADDRESS_1273710]. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations that 
are defined as deleterious and suspected deleterious mutations are associated with loss-of-function of the protein. 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 defective tumors are intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors, both in 
tumor models in vivo ( Rottenberg et al 2008 , Gelmon et al 2011 , Hay et al 2009 ) and in the 
clinic ( Fong et al 2009 ).  The mechanism of action for olaparib is thought to result from the 
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_907354], preventing their repair ( Helleday 2011 , Murai et al 
2012).  Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit selected tumor cell lines in vitro 
and in xenograft and primary explant models, as well as in genetic BRCA knock-out models, either as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Individuals with germline BRCA mutations (gBRCAms) will carry [ADDRESS_1273711] the wild type copy of the BRCA gene. Normal cells in subjects who carry a gBRCAm can therefore repair DSBs with the functioning 
wild type BRCA allele. However, in cancer cells, the loss of heterozygosity leaves the 
non-functional germline BRCA (gBRCA) allele as the sole copy. In this way, PARP inhibition takes advantage of this difference and preferentially kills the cancer cells with minimal 
toxicity to normal cells ( Rottenberg et al 2008 , Gelmon et al 2011 , Hay et al 2009 ).

25 (138)Olaparib
The US FDA approved the tablet formulation of olaparib in August 2017. The FDA approval of the tablet formulation is as follows:
# For the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_12248], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete 
or partial response to plat inum-based chemotherapy.
# For the treatment of adult patients  with deleteri ous or suspected 
deleterious germline BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have 
been treated with 3 or more prior lines  of chemotherapy. Patients for this 
indication are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion 
diagnostic for olaparib.
The maintenance indication with the tab let formulation was based on 2 randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were in response to platinum-based therapy.
SOLO-2 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients 
(N=295) with gBRCA-mutated ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer were randomized (2:1) to receive olaparib tablets 300 mg orally twice daily ( bid) or placebo until 
unacceptable toxicity or PD. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_907368] (complete versus partial) and time to disease progression in the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy prior to enrollment (6 months to 12 months versus 
> 12 months). All patients had received at least 2 prior platinum-containing regimens and 
were in response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based regimen. All patients had a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm as detected either by a local test 
(n= 236) or central Myriad Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments test (n=59), 
subsequently confirmed by [CONTACT_907369] (n= 286). The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Additional endpoints included overall 
survival (OS).

from a blinded independent review were consistent. At the time of the analysis of PFS, OS

The median age of patients treated with ol aparib (n=136) was 58 years (range: 21 to 89) and 
59 years (range: 33 to 84) among patients treated with placebo (n=129). Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor mance status was 0 in 81% of patients receiving olaparib and 
74% of patients receiving placebo. Of all patients, 97% were White, 19% were enrolled in the 
US or Canada, 45% were in CR following their most recent platinum chemotherapy regimen, 
and 40% had a progression-free interval of 6 m onths to 12 months since their penultimate 
platinum. Prior bevacizumab therapy was reported for 13% of patients receiving olaparib and 
16% of patients receiving placebo. A retrospective analysis for gBRCAm status, some performed using the Myriad test, indicated that 36% (n=96) of patients from the 
Intent-to-Treat population had deleterious gBRCAm, including 39% (n=53) of patients on

The US FDA approved the capsule formulation of olaparib in December 2014 for 
monotherapy in subjects with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm (as detected by 
[CONTACT_13247]-approved test) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with 3 or more prior 
lines of chemotherapy.  
This was based on Study 42 ( Kaufman et al 2015 ) in which olaparib (400 mg bid8 capsules) 
was given to 193 subjects in an advanced ovarian cancer cohort, of whom 178 had ovarian 
cancer, 4 had fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351], and 11 had primary peritoneal cancer; 148 (77%) of those 
in the ovarian cancer cohort had a germline mutation in BRCA1 , 44 (23%) had a BRCA2
mutation, and 1 had a germline mutation in both BRCA1 and BCRA2 . These subjects were 
heavily pretreated, with a mean number of 4.3 pri or regimens. All sub jects had received prior 
platinum therapy and were considered to be platinum-resistant or not suitable for further 
platinum therapy. The objective respons e rate (ORR) in this study was 31.1% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 24.6-38.1%), medium PFS was 7 months (54.6% 
progression-free at 6 months), and medium OS was 16.6 months (64.4% alive at 12 months).

29 (138)In Study 20, a Phase II open-label, non-randomized  study, women with advanced high-grade 
serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma or triple-negative breast cancer received 
400 mg olaparib capsules bid. Subjects were stratified according to whether they had a BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutation or not. Ninety-one subjects were enrolled ([ADDRESS_1273718] cancer). In the ovarian cancer cohorts, confirmed objective responses were seen 
in 7 (41%; 95% CI = 22-64) of 17 subjects with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 11 (24%; 
95% CI =14-38) of 46 patients without BRCA mutation (BRCAm) ( Gelmon et al 2011 ).
In Study 19 ( Ledermann et al 2014 ), olaparib (400 mg bidcapsules) or matching placebo 
(randomized 1:1) was given as maintenance monotherapy to 265 subjects with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade serious ovarian cancer. In subjects with a BRCAm
detected in their blood (gBRCAm) and/or tumor (somatic BRCA mutation [sBRCAm]), 
treatment with olaparib resulted in a significant increase in:
# PFS versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10-0.31; 
p < 0.0001).
In subjects without a BRCAm (i.e., BRCA wild  type [BRCAwt]), maintenance treatment 
resulted in a smaller, but still statistically significant increase in PFS (HR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.34–0.85; p = 0.0075) ( Ledermann et al 2014 ).
More recently, with longer follow-up from this study an OS clinical benefit for olaparib maintenance therapy in the overall and the BRCAm subject groups was observed (BRCAm OS HR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.41-0.94; median 34.9 months olaparib, 30.2 months placebo) 
(Ledermann et al 2016 ).
Furthermore, clinical data in a small number of sub jects within the sBRCAm s ubpopulation in 
Study 19 ( Ledermann et al 2014 ) are consistent with the larger BRCA mutated dataset 
(gBRCA cohort), as fewer subjects on the olaparib arm reported progression events or death 
events. An exploratory analysis of tumor genetics in these subjects suggests that gBRCAm 
and sBRCAm in these tumors are indistinguishable in terms of their clonality and comp lete 
loss of the relevant BRCAwt allele.  
To date, the sBRCAm olaparib data is availab le from these 20 sBRCAm subjects in Study 19. 
In Study 19 ( Ledermann et al 2014 ), 10 subjects received olaparib and 10 subjects received 
placebo and were retrospectively assessed for PFS and OS. See Table 3 below.

Study tests
BRACAnalysis CDx®: The blood based BRACAnalysis CDx® test is the FDA-approved 
companion diagnostic test with olaparib fo r detection of gBRCA sequence variants.  Subjects 
determined to carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 can 
be considered to have a gBRCAm. 
myChoice®HRD : The tumor based myChoice®HRD test simultaneously measures HRD
through detection of 3 types of large rearrangements: loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic 
imbalance, and large-scale state transitions; and detects sequence variants in the BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 genes. Therefore, m yChoice®HRD will inform on HRD and BRCA. An HRD score is 
used to assess a subject’s level of deficiency in their tumor, and those carrying a deleterious or 
suspected deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 can be considered to have a tumor 
BRCAm.
Several research groups have used BRCAm ovarian and breast cancer as positive controls to 
develop such an assay ( Abkevich et al 2012 ).  This study will use the Myriad myChoice®
HRD assay which was developed from the Abkevich et al approach as described by [CONTACT_907372] 2014 .  The assay has been linked to sensitivity to platinum based chemotherapy and a 
similar assay was linked to response to another PARP inhibitor, but with a lower response rate than for BRCAm subjects ( McNeish 2015 ).
myChoice
®HRD is the first HRD test that can detect when a tumor has lost the ability to 
repair double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging 
drugs such as platinum drugs or PARP inhibitors. High m yChoice®HRD scores reflective of 
DNA repair deficiencies are prevalent in all breast cancer subtypes, ovarian, and most other 
major cancers. In previously published data, Myriad showed that the m yChoice®HRD test

31 (138)predicted drug response to platinum therapy in certain subjects with triple-negative breast and 
ovarian cancers. 
A study by [CONTACT_907373] m yChoice®HRD diagnostic test is predictive of 
BRCA deficiency and supports its use to help id entify subjects with advanced ovarian cancer 
who may respond to treatment with niraparib, a PARP inhibitor.  A total of [ADDRESS_1273720] and BRCA1/2 mutations.  The 
results showed that all BRCA deficient tumors (n = 26) were m yChoice®HRD positive 
except 1. Additionally, the response to nirapa rib monotherapy was evaluated in 20 unique 
tumor models across a range of myChoice®HRD scores and all of the tumors that responded 
to niraparib were myChoice®HRD positive, irrespectiv e of BRCA deficiency status 
(Wilcoxen et al 2015 ).
The double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III NOVA trial enrolled more than [ADDRESS_1273721] recent platinum-based 
chemotherapy. This trial demonstrated that niraparib significantly prolonged PFS compared to 
placebo control among subjects who we re gBRCAm carriers (HR = 0.27, median PFS 
21.0 months vs. 5.5 months, p < 0.0001). For sub jects without a gBRCAm, but whose tumors 
were determined to be HRD positive using the Myriad myChoice®HRD test, niraparib 
significantly prolonged PFS (HR = 0.38, medi an PFS 12.9 months vs. 3.8 months,
p < 0.0001).  Niraparib also showed statist ical signif icance in the overall non-gBRCAm
cohort, which included subjects with both m yChoice®HRD-positive and HRD-negative 
tumors (HR = 0.45, median PFS 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months p < 0.0001) ( TESARO 2016 ).
In an exploratory analysis of olaparib from Study 19 ( Ledermann et al 2014 ), there was some 
evidence suggesting that the HRD assay c ould identify BRCAwt subjects benefiting from 
olaparib maintenance therapy, although numbers were small ( Hodgson et al 2015 ).  Hence,
there is a rationale and some supportive data to expect an increased PFS in this subject
population, but with an expectation of a potentially lower effect size.
Subjects will be recruited to this study using 2 assays, BRACAnalysis CDx®(gBRCA status) 
and myChoice®HRD (tumor BRCA status and HRD status), running in parallel for cohort 
assignment. 
Homologous recombination repair mutation (HRRm) gene panel : As a secondary 
objective, there will be a prospective baseline analysis using a test to assess germline 
mutations in a panel of genes from the HRR pathway. The panel is composed of [ADDRESS_1273722] genes: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD54L, RAD51D, 
FANC/BRIP1, FANCI, FANCL, FANCN(PALB2), BARD1, CHEK1, CHEK2, CDK12, and 
PPP2R2A.  The result of this HRRm test will not determine cohort assignment, and w ill only 
be conducted in those subjects assigned to the cohorts with BRCAwt.
Indeed, deficiencies in the HRR pathway, such  as those resulting from mutations in HRR 
genes, may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors ( McCabe et al 2006 ).

germline BRCA1/2 mutations ( Pennington et al 2014 ). Study 19 also demonstrated that 
subjects with mutated HRR genes had benefits to their PFS ( Hodgson et al 2015). 
Exploratory analyses from the Study 19 ( Ledermann et al 2014 ; Dougherty et al 2015 ) dataset 
showed that subjects with BRCAwt, but identified with HRD (either via myChoice®HRD or 
HRRm panel) derived benefit from olaparib therapy based on progression events (no ORR 
data available).

with albeit limited PFS data, these data provide some promising evidence to predict that 
olaparib could generate responses in eac h of these populations relating subjects with 
sBRCAm, HRRm, and HRD (genetic scar/myChoice®HRD) status to a clinical outcome 
(ORR).  
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses, and control groups
The proposed Phase II study is designed to assess the benefit of olaparib tablets therapy in 
4 cohorts of subjects with different statuses of BRCAms/HRD by [CONTACT_907376] (in the form of objective response) and safety of ol aparib tablets monotherapy. This study will 
further assess the benefit of olaparib tab lets in subjects beyond gBRCA, where limited 
evidence currently exists for benefit with the capsule formulation, i.e., in subjects with identified by [CONTACT_907363]
®HRD (genetic scar) and HRRm (mutations in an identified panel of 
genes associated with HRR). Limited or no reported data exists for the tablet formulation in 
the second line treatment setting for olaparib and will be further assessed in these study populations.

33 (138)Subjects will be enro lled into 1 of 4 c ohorts based on gBRCA status and m yChoice®HRD test 
with ORR as the primary endpoint.  Homologous recombination repair mutation status 
relation to clinical outcome will be a secondary endpoint in this study and will be used to assess whether the gene panel additionally identified subjects who benefit from olaparib.  
Secondary endpoints w ill also include duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), 
cancer antigen (CA)-125 response rate, PFS, time  to any progression ( TTAP, either CA-125 
progression or objective progression or death), OS, mutation status of the HRRm related to 
clinical outcome, and safety assessments.  Exploratory correlative studies will be conducted to 
assess potential biomarkers that correlate with clinical outcomes.
Platinum and taxane based chemotherapy is standard of care front-line treatment for women 
with ovarian cancer. Sixty to 90 percent of women will demonstrate an objective response to 
this therapy. ( Markman et al 1991) The vast majority of these women will either have 
recurrence or progression of their disease. The choice of therapy at that time depends in part 
on platinum sensitivity. If a patient has platinum  sensitive ovarian cancer they are generally 
retreated with a platinum regimen with responses of 17% to 79% ( Gore et al 1990 , Aghajanian 
et al 2012 ). The introduction of PARP inhibitors has provided an effective treatment option 
for women with ovarian cancer (Study 19 and SOLO-2). PARP inhibitors are being utilized 
for patients with fewer previous lines of ther apy.  The PARP inhibitor rucaparib was studied 
in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian cancer in 204 evaluable patients, including 
121 (59%) patients after 1 previous line of platinum-based chemotherapy ( Swisher et al 2017 ).
Results reported by [CONTACT_907377], and not by [CONTACT_907378]. Konecny ( Konecny et al 2017 ) reported ORR in a subset of these patients treated 
with rucaparib:  In 57 platinum-sensitive patients whose immediate prior therapy was platinum-based, the investigator-assessed ORR was 70% (95% CI: 57-72) for the overall population, with 83% , 86%, and 52%  ORRs observed in patients treated with 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_1273727] chemotherapy.

1.3.2 Clinical benefit 
For specific information on the clinical benefit of olaparib monotherapy in subjects with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed gBRCAm ovarian  cancer and in subjects without gBRCAm 
ovarian cancer, see the olaparib IB.
The FDA approval of the tablet formulation is as follows:
# For the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_907355], who are in completeresponse (CR) or partial response (PR) to platinum-based chemotherapy.
# For the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have 
been treated with 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients for this indication are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion 
diagnostic for olaparib.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical benefit of olaparib monotherapy in subjects with platinum-sensitive 
recurrent gBRCA mutated ovarian cancer 
The pooled analysis from 6 olaparib (Phases I a nd II) monotherapy clinical studies consisting 
of 300 subjects with gBRCA mutated relapsed ovarian cancer (including fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_907356]), of whom 273 had measurabl e disease and were evaluable for response, 
demonstrated an ORR with olaparib in the overall group of 36% (97/273) and 7.4 months 
DoR ([COMPANY_008] data on file). The majority of  the subjects (n = 223) had received 3 or more 
prior lines of therapy and of thes e, 205 subjects had measurable disease. In these subjects, the 
response rate was 31% (64/205) and DoR was 7.8 months. Nineteen percent (n = 51) of the 273 subjects with measurable disease were classif ied as platinum-sensitive. The response rate 
in the platinum-sensitive subjects was 53% (27/51) and the DoR was 8.2 months. 
The majority of the subjects in the pooled analysis (n = 193) were enrolled in Study 42
(Domcheck et al 2016 ), a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative, 
multi-center study to assess the efficacy and sa fety of olaparib (400 mg capsules) given orally 
bidin subjects with advanced cancers, which were refractory to standard therapy or for whom 
no suitable, effective/curative therapy existed, and who had a confirmed genetic BRCA1 
and/or BRCA2 mutation. In Study 42, there were 193 sub jects with relapsed  ovarian cancer 
(including fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_592821]), of whom 167 had measurable disease. In 
this overall group, the response rate was 36% (60/167) and DoR was 7.4 months 
(Kaufman et al 2015 ). Subjects were also analyzed by [CONTACT_907379], if their 
last treatment was platinum based, and in the group of subjects who were classed as 
platinum-sensitive (when time from last plati num to PD was > 6 months) but ineligible to 
receive further platinum (typi[INVESTIGATOR_907357]), th e response rate with

37 (138)olaparib was higher than in the group of subjects with platinum-resistant disease (60% [15/25] 
vs. 15% [6/40], respectively) ( Domcheck et al 2016 ). 
Furthermore, 97 subjects in the pooled analysis were included from Study 12, a randomized, 
open-label, Phase II, dose-finding study of olaparib monotherapy (200 mg bidand 400 mg bid
capsule) vs. PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in gBRCAm ovarian cancer subjects 
who had failed previous platinum therapy and were not considered candidates for further platinum treatment. The primary analysis of PFS (Investigator assessment) comparing both
doses of olaparib to PLD did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference (n = 81;
HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.51-1.56), median PFS 6.5 months, 8.8 months, and 7.1 months for the olaparib 200 mg, olaparib 400 mg, and PLD groups, respectively ( Kaye S et al 2012 ). 
Objective response rates were 25%, 31%, and 18% for the olaparib 200 mg, 400 mg, and PLD 
groups, respectivel y. However, a pre-specified subgroup analysis in the platinum-sensitive 
subjects in the trial (n = 48), showed an HR for PFS numerically higher for the olaparib 
400 mg group vs. PLD (n = 34; HR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.24-1.50) with median PFS 9.2 months 
in the olaparib 400 mg group and 7.4 months in the PLD group and response rates of 47% and 26%, respectively. 
In SOLO-2 investigator-assessed PFS (primary endpoi nt) was significantly longer for patients 
receiving olaparib versus placebo (HR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.22-0.41, P<0.0001; median
19.1 months versus 5.5 months, respectively). Th e evaluation of PFS by [CONTACT_907380] a significan t PFS benefit in favor of olaparib (HR = 0.25, 
95% CI = 0.18-0.35, P<0.0001; median 30.2 months versus 5.5months). The PFS benefit was supported by a significant improvement for olaparib in time to second progression 
(HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.34-0.72, P=0.0002), and a clinically meaningful improvement in time 
to first subsequent therapy or death (HR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.21-0.38, P<0.0001) and time to second subsequent therapy or death (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.26-0.53, P<0.0001). The OS data 
were immature at this data cut-off (maturity 24%) and median OS was not reached in either 
treatment group.
1.3.3 Safety a nd tolerability of olaparib
The tolerability profile of olaparib is character ized by [CONTACT_907381] 2014, in cluding long term OS benefit ( Ledermann et al 2016 ).  It is suitable for 
long-term dosing until disease progression in subjects with relapsed platinum-sensitive 
ovarian cancer who carry a gBRCAm.   For further information on the safety and tolerability 
of olaparib, including common adverse events, see the olaparib IB.
The most common adverse events considered to be associated with administration of olaparib 
include hematological effects (anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, mean 
corpuscular volume elevation), decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, 
stomatitis, upper abdominal pain, dysgeusia, fatigue (including asthenia), increase in blood 
creatinine, headache, and dizziness. In a small number of subjects, pneumonitis, 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and new primary 
malignancies have been reported. The cumulative incidences fall within that expected for the 
subject population under study in the reported literature. These events are considered potential

without prejudice to further treatment;
# Adverse event;
# Severe non-compliance with the Clinical Study Protocol;
# Investigator determines it is in the best interest of the subject to

# Bone marrow findings consistent with MDS/AML; or
# Objective progression according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1273747] 
At any time, subjects are free to disconti nue olaparib or withdraw from the active treatment 
phase of the study (i.e., olaparib and assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to 
further treatment.  A subject who decides to di scontinue olaparib will complete the Study 
Treatment Discontinuation Visit (see Section 4.2.5 ) and will be asked about the reason(s) for 
discontinuation and the presence of any adverse events.  Adverse events will be followed-up 
(see Section 6), and all study medications shoul d be returned by [CONTACT_423].
By [CONTACT_662798], the subject then enters the survival follow-up phase of the study.  Subjects should be followed for progression (if discontinuation in the absence of 
progression) and survival following treatment discontinuation as per the study plan (see
Section 4.3and Table 6 ).  Any subject who has not yet shown objective radiological disease 
progression at withdrawal from olaparib should c ontinue to be followed as per RECIST v1.1.
Any subject discontinuing olaparib should be seen at [ADDRESS_1273748]’s tumor status should be assessed 
clinically, and, if appropriate, disease progression should be confirmed by [CONTACT_907386] v1.1 criteria.  After discon tinuation of study medication, the Principal 
Investigator/Sub-Investigator will perform the best possible observation(s), test(s), and 
evaluation(s), as well as give appropriate medication and all possible measures for the safety 
of the subject.  In additio n, they will record in the el ectronic case report form (eCRF) the date 
of discontinuation, the reasons, manifestation, and treatment at the time of discontinuation.  If
a subject discontinues study treatment, the [COMPANY_008] Representative Study Physician must be informed immediately.  The Subject will be required to attend the treatment discontinuation

extended. 
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time (olaparib and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events.  The Investigator will follow-up adverse events outside of the clinical 
study.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, her enrollment code cannot be reused.  
Withdrawn subjects will be replaced if the subject is withdrawn prior to the first post-baseline 
objective response assessment.  Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced if the subject has had a post-baseline objective response assessment.  
If a subject withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent 
to:
# Further participation in the study including any further survival follow-up 
(e.g., survival calls);
# Withdrawal of consent to the use of their study generated data; or
# Withdrawal to the use of any samples (see Section 5.6.9 ).
The status of ongoing, withdrawn (from the study), and “lost to follow-up” subjects at the time of an OS analysis should be obtained by [CONTACT_907388], 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], contact[CONTACT_13742]’s general practitioner, and checking publicly available 
death registries.  In the event that the subject has actively withdrawn consent to the processing 
of their personal data, the vital status of the subject can be obtained by [CONTACT_230602].
For information regarding the withdrawal of consent for donated biological samples, see 
Section 5.6.9 .
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], study subjects are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that:

®HRD, as well as in subjects without identifiable HRD.  
This study will utilize Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx®for germline BRCA analysis and a tumor 
test (myChoice®HRD) for tumor BRCA analysis and HRD status. The Myriad testing may be 
submitted in advance of the 28-day screening window if the subject consents to the 
appropriate pre-screening informed consent form. 
Four cohorts will be identified based upon genetic testing:
# Cohort 1: gBRCAm,
# Cohort 2: somatic BRCA mutated (sBRCAm) and germline BRCA wild 
type,  
# Cohort 3: myChoice®HRD positive (genomic instability positive) and 
BRCA wild type (BRCAwt) (no BRCA mutation),  
# Cohort 4: myChoice®HRD negative (genomic instability negative) and 
BRCAwt (no BRCA mutation).
For the cohort enrollment stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], see Section 3.5 and Section 8.5.4 .
This study consists of an up to 28-day screening period (Day -28 to Day -1) once the subject signs the main study consent. See Section 4.1.
Following the screening period, eligible subjects will enter the active treatment period of the 
study. Study visits will be conducted at Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 3), Day 15 (Visit 4), 
Day 22 (Visit 5), Day 29 (Visit 6), and on Day 1 of a 4-week visit period up to 52 weeks (if 
not progressed and still on treatment), then on Day 1 of a 12-week visit period relative to date CCI

radiological progression in accorda nce with RECIST v1.1, irrespective of treatment decisions 
(i.e., RECIST follow-up until progression even if  a subject discontinues study treatment prior 
to progression and/or receives a subsequent therapy prior to progression).  
At baseline, the imaging modalities used for RECIST assessment will be CT (MRI where CT 
is contraindicated) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with other regions as clinically 
indicated for the assessment of disease.  Follow-up CT or MRI assessments (per RECISTv1.1) will be by [CONTACT_13190] (in those subjects wi th disease in the chest or upper abdomen 
lymphadenopathy at baseline), abdomen, and pelvis, with any other regions imaged at baseline where disease was present.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  The methods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline must be 
used at each subsequent follow-up assessment. A CT examination with intravenous contrast 
media administration is the preferred method. An MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or it is medically c ontraindicated. For brain lesion asse ssment, MRI is the preferred 
method. Subjects must be followe d-up until RECIST disease progression.
Radiological examinations performed in the conduct of this study s hould be retained at the site 
as source data.
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  If scans are 
performed outside of the scheduled visit ± [ADDRESS_1273770] has not progressed, every attempt should be made to  perform the subsequent scans at their scheduled 
time points (± 1 week).  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1273771] v1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, 
target and non-target lesions (TLs), and the objective tumor response criteria (CR, PR, SD, or 
PD) are presented in Appendix G .

68 (138)Note: The biopsied tumor sample taken at screening should not be assessed as a TL as part of 
the RECIST assessments if there are other lesions available.  The biopsy should be taken after 
the baseline scan has been performed. 
Although CA-[ADDRESS_1273772] v1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_737], or when they meet any discontinuation criteria (see Section 3.9).  After documentation of disease
progression, subjects will be followed for survival.    
If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly with 
response to non-TL or the appearance of a new lesion, treatment should continue until the next 
scheduled assessment, or sooner if clinically indicated, and the Investigator should reassess 
the subject’s status.  If repeat scans confirm  progression, then the date of the initial scan 
should be declared as the date of progression.  
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increas e’ in the size of 1 or m ore non-TLs is usually 
not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.
5.2 Safety assessments
For the timing of individual measurements, refer to the study plan (see Table 6 ). Adverse 
events will be collected continuously throughout the active treatment period including the 
follow-up period.
5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation,
and urinalysis will be taken at the times indicated in the study plan (see Table 6 ). Note: Safety 
blood samples (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology , coagulation, etc.) do not need to be 
repeated on Visit 2 (Day 1) of the study treatme nt if assessed at least [ADDRESS_1273773] changed significantly. 
Additional safety samples (e.g., clinical chemis try, hematology, coagulation, etc.) may be 
collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator.  The date, time of 
collection, and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF.
The clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at 
or near to the investigative site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on 
laboratory method used and routine practice at the site.

[IP_ADDRESS] Disease specific tumor marker samples (CA-125)
As part of the routine safety blood samples, all subjects will supply bl ood samples for CA-125 
(2 mL) assessment at the beginning of each 4-week period prior to the subject receiving study 
treatment.  
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  If CA-125 assessment 
is performed outside of the scheduled visit ± 1-week window interval, every attempt should be 
made to assess the CA-125 at the scheduled time points.  Subjects will be evaluated until 
objective disease progression (RECIST v1.1), based on progressive serial elevation of serum CA-[ADDRESS_1273775] response and/or a CA-125 response will be summarized.

Electrocardiograms will be recorded at 25 mm/sec.  All ECGs should be assessed by [CONTACT_907400]/not clinically significantly abnormal.  If there is a clinically significant abnormal finding, the Investigator will record it as 
an adverse event in the eCRF.  The original ECG traces must be stored in the subject medical 
record as source data.
5.2.4 Vital signs
Height will be assessed at screening only. Weight will be assessed at screening and as 
clinically indicated, according to the study plan (see Table 6 ).
Any changes in vital signs should be recorded as an adverse event, if applicable.  For information on how adverse events based on changes in vital signs should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulse and blood pressure
Blood pressure and pulse will be assessed at screening, baseline, and at the Follow-up Visit, 
according to the study plan (see Table 6 ).
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured preferably using a semi-automatic blood pressure recording device with an appropriate cuff size after [ADDRESS_1273777].  
The date of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Body temperature
Body temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius according to local practice. The 
measurements and dates at screening, baseline, and at the Follow-up Visit (see Table 6 ) will 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
5.2.5 Other safety assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Serum or urine pregnancy test
Pregnancy tests on blood or urine samples will be performed for women of childbearing 
potential within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment, on Day 1 of the study prior to 
commencing treatment, at the time points shown in Table 6 during study treatment and at the 
30 day follow up visit. Pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential should be 
conducted at regular intervals (e.g., monthly). Tes ts will be performed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local 
laboratory.  If results are positive, the subject is ineligible/must be discontinued from study

myChoice®HRD tests are completed, the results ar e received by [CONTACT_737], and it is 
confirmed there is an open cohort available for which the subject is eligible.
All local procedures for genetic counseling mu st be followed for subjects who do not know 
their gBRCA status at study entry. 
Samples will be collected and sh ipped after the subject has signed informed consent. Myriad 
screening test results will be reported back to the investigative site for clinical assessment.  
Residual blood (or its derivatives) may be used to evaluate future companion diagnostic tests 
and for additional exploratory work.  Note: The Myriad testing may be submitted in advance 
of the 28-day screening window if the subject consents to the appropriate pre-screening 
informed consent form.
As part of the subject’s consent, residual tumor or blood (or derivatives) may be used to 
evaluate future companion diagnostic tests and for additional exploratory work, to elucidate 
the mechanism of response, understand the m ode of action of study tr eatment,  and improve 
the understanding of disease recurrence (including BRCAm or HRD status and its role in response).  Information regarding tumor/bl ood sample col lection can be  found in the

mandatory.  
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the subjects at Visit 2.  Although 
genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias 
through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an adverse event, as such subjects
would be important to include in any genetic analysis.  If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Visit 2, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.

Collection of the biological samples is an integral part of the st udy; if the subject withdraws 
consent prior to receiving the first dose, the subject will be withdrawn from further study 
participation; however, if the subject withdraws consent after receiving the first dose, the
subject may continue in the study.

The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153188].
6.[ADDRESS_1273784].  An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., la boratory findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an 
adverse event can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term adverse event is used to include both serious and non-serious adverse events.
6.1.[ADDRESS_1273785] (AESI) are events of scientific and medical interest specific 
to the further understanding of olaparib’s safety profile and that require close monitoring and 
rapid communication by [CONTACT_907401].  An AESI may be serious or non-serious.  However, AESIs for olaparib should be considered as SAEs as 
they are medically important and have been identified as important potential risks for olaparib
that are under close surveillance at [COMPANY_008]. The olaparib AESIs include MDS/AML, new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML), and pneumonitis.  
ANY event of suspected or confirmed MDS/AML, new primary malignancy, or pneumonitis, 
regardless of the severity, should be treated as  an SAE and reported to the [COMPANY_008] Safety
Representative according to SAE reporti ng processes and t imelines (see Section 6.4). 
A targeted questionnaire will be sent to any Investigator reporting an AESI as an aid to 
provide further detailed information on the event.  During the study there may be other events 
identified as AESIs that require the use of a questionnaire to help characterize the event and 
gain a better understanding regarding the relatio nship between the event and study treatment.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an adverse event occurring during a ny study phase (i.e., run-in, treatment, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfills 1 or more of the following criteria:
# Results in death;
# Is immediately life-threatening;
# Requires in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929];
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Olaparib
Study Code D0816L00003Version 3.0
Date 10 October 2017
79 (138)# Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;
# Is a congenital abnormality or bi rth defect; or
# Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_1273786] informed consent for 
participating in the study, continuously throughout the active tr eatment period including the 
follow-up period.
Serious adverse events will be recorded from the time of informed consent for participating in 
the study. See Section 6.4.
After the data cut-off for the primary and secondary endpoint analyses, any ongoing adverse 
events/SAEs will be followed for resolution and included in the [COMPANY_008] Safety Database.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events after the 30 day follow-up period
For pharmacovigilance purposes and characterization, any case of MDS/AML or new primary 
malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow-up period should be reported to the [COMPANY_008] 
Safety Representative whether it is considered a non-serious adverse event(e.g., non-melanoma skin cancer) or an SAE, and regardless of the Investigator’s assessment 
of causality.  Investigators will be asked during the regular follow-up for survival if the 
subject has developed MDS/AML or a ne w primary malignancy, and will be prompted to 
report any such cases.  
At any time after a subject has completed th e study (i.e., no longer receiving study drug and
past the 30 day follow-up period), if an Investigator learns of any SAE, including sudden 
death of unknown cause, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is 
causally related to olaparib, the Invest igator should notify the [COMPANY_008] Safety 
Representative.
Otherwise, after study treatment completi on (i.e., after any scheduled post-treatment 
follow-up period has ended), there is no obligation to actively report information on new 
adverse events or SAEs occurring in former study subjects.

# Description of adverse event.
Severity of adverse event
For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_682705], all changes to the CTCAE grade attained, as well as the 
highest attained CTCAE (version 4.03) grade, should be reported.
It is important to distinguish between serious a nd severe adverse events.  Severity is a measure 
of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An adverse event of 
severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists 
for several hours may be considered severe  nausea but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke, but w ould be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
The grading scales found in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 4.03 will be 
utilized for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned 
CTCAE grades, the recommendation is that the CTCAE criteria that convert mild, moderate,
and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be dow nloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship b etween olaparib and each adverse event, and
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be  assessed for other medications and study 
procedures.  Note: For SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes.’
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study Protocol.
6.3.[ADDRESS_1273788] or reported in response to the open 
question from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous 
visit/you were last asked?,’ or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], will be collected and recorded in the 
eCRF.  When collecting adverse events, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis 
and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.

82 (138)6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital 
signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as adverse events if 1 of the 
following is met:
# Any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled,
# Causes study treatment discontinu ation,
# Causes study tr eatment interruption,
# Causes study treatment dose reduction, or
# The Investigator believes that the abno rmality should be reported as an 
adverse event.
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clin ical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an adverse event, and the associated laboratory 
result/vital sign will be considered as a dditional information.  Wherever possible, the 
reporting Investigator should use the  clinical, rather than the la boratory term (e.g., an emia
versus low hemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically 
relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameter s should be reported as adverse event(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should
not be reported as an adverse event/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical 
examination, as compared with the baseline assessment, w ill be re ported as an adverse event.
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Potential Hy’s Law cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require 
further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ∀3 × ULN together with TBL ∀2 × ULN 
and may need to be reported as SAEs.  Confirmed Hy’s Law cases should always be reported 
as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in liver 
biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.

disease under study and/or increases in th e signs and symptoms of the cancer.  The 
development of new, or progression of exis ting metastasis to the primary cancer under study 
should be considered as disease progression and not an adverse event.  Events which are 
unequivocally due to disease progression should not  be reported as adverse events during the 
study.

RECIST v1.1. See Appendix G . 
6.3.9 New cancers
The development of a new primary cancer (including skin cancer) should be regarded as an 
adverse event (see Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_1273790]).  New primary 
malignancies are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study 
treatment and have developed after the inclusion  of the subject into the study.  They do not 
include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself 
should not be reported as an adverse event/SAE , as they are considered to be disease 
progression.
6.3.10 Lack of efficacy
When there is deterioration in the cancer for which the study treatment(s) is being used, there 
may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of  efficacy or an adverse event.  In such cases, 
unless the Sponsor or the reporting physician considers that the study treatment contributed to 
the deterioration of the condition, the deterior ation should be considered to be a lack of 
efficacy and not an adverse event.

# Death that is clearly the result of disease progression should be reported 
to the study monitor at the next monitoring visit and should be

90 (138)[IP_ADDRESS] Management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., dyspnea) or radiological abnormalities occur 
in the absence of a clear diagnosis, an interruption in study treatment dosing is recommended 
and further diagnostic workup (including a high resolution CT scan) should be performed to 
exclude pneumonitis.
Following investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and 
symptoms resolve, then study treatment can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_3786].  If significant pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be discussed 
with the [COMPANY_008] Representative Study Physician.
If a subject experiences a dose interruption > [ADDRESS_1273796] cannot restart study 
medication. See Section 6.7. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of nausea and vomiting
Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with olaparib treatment.  In 
study D0810C00019, nausea was reported in 71% of the olaparib treated subjects and 36% ofthe placebo treated subjects, and vomiting was re ported in 34% of the olaparib treated subjects 
and 14% of the placebo treated subjects.   These events are generally mild to moderate 
(CTCAE grade 1 or 2) in severity, intermittent, and manageable on continued treatment.  The first onset generally occurs in the first month of treatment for nausea and within the first 
6 months of treatment for vomiting.  For nausea, the incidence generally plateaus around 
9 months and for vomiting around 6 to 7 months.
No routine prophylactic anti-emetic treatment is required at the start of study treatment;
however, subjects should receive appropriate anti-emetic treatment at the first onset of nausea 
or vomiting and as required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines.  Alternatively, olaparib tablets can be taken with a light meal/snack (i.e., [ADDRESS_1273797] or a 
couple of biscuits). Note: For a dverse events of nausea and vomiting, an additional eCRF is 
required.
As per international guidance on anti-emetic use in cancer subjects (European Society for 
Medical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network), generally a single agent 
anti-emetic should be considered, e.g., dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines, or dexamethasone.

91 (138)[IP_ADDRESS] Renal impairment
If subsequent to study entry and while still on study therapy, a subject’s estimated creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) decreases to become < 51 mL/mi n, retesting should be  performed promptly.  
A dose reduction is recommended for subjects who meet the following criteria during the course of the study:
# Baseline CrCl ∀51 mL/min who have on study a CrCl < 51 mL/min,
# Baseline CrCl < 51 mL/min but had serum creatinine !1.5 × ULN, and 
then on study had a clinically meaningful lower CrCl value.
 
Olaparib has not been studied in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl !30 mL/min) or 
end-stage renal disease; if subjects develop severe impairment or end-stage renal diseaseolaparib must be discontinued.
[IP_ADDRESS] Interruptions for intercurrent non-toxicity related events
Study treatment dose interruption for conditions other than toxicity resolution should be kept 
as short as possible.  If a subject cannot res tart study treatment within 4 weeks for resolution 
of intercurrent conditions not related to di sease progression or toxicity, the case should be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_008] Repr esentative Study P hysician. See Section 6.7. 
All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the reductions/interruptions, are to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Study treatment should be stoppe d at least [ADDRESS_1273798] undergoes 
palliative radiation treatment.  Study  treatment should be restarted  within 4 weeks as long as 
any bone marrow toxicity has recovered.
Because the adverse events related to olapar ib may include asthenia, fatigue, and dizziness, 
subjects should be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if these symptoms 
occur.

post-study completion.  [COMPANY_008] will continue  to supply olaparib tablets after comp letion 
of this study until olaparib tablets are approve d and commercially available and subjects will 
then be transferred to commercially available olaparib tablets. 
Dose Reductions 
For guidance on dose reductions for management of adverse events, refer to Section 6.7.
For guidance on dose reductions when concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
cannot be avoided, see Section 7.7.  
7.3 Labeling
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local 
regulatory guidelines.  The labels will fulfill GMP Annex [ADDRESS_1273799] under appropriate storage conditions. The olaparib label on the bottle specifies the appropriate storage. 
7.5 Compliance
The administration of all study medications (in cluding olaparib) should be recorded in the 
appropriate sections of the eCRF.
Subjects should be given clear instructions on how  and when to take their study treatment.  
Subjects will self-administer olaparib.  Study site staff will perform tablet counts at regular 
intervals during treatment.  Compliance will be  assessed by [CONTACT_907402], and the 
information will be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  After the tablet count has 
been performed, the remaining tablets will not be  returned to the subject but will be retained 
by [CONTACT_76450].  All subjects 
must return their bottle(s) of olaparib at th e appropriate scheduled visit, when a new bottle 
will be dispensed. Subjects will be instructed to notify study site personnel of missed doses.  
Subjects must return all containers and any remaining tablets at the end of the study.
7.6 Accountability
The study drug provided for this study will be used only as directed in the Clinical Study 
Protocol.
The study site personnel or study monitor will acc ount for olaparib received at the site, unused 
study drugs, and for appropriate destructions. Certificates of delivery, destruction, or return 
should be signed.

documents ‘Procedures for drug accountability’ and ‘Procedures for drug storage,’ which 
describe the specific requirements.  The Investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that the subject has returned all unused study medication.
7.7 Concomitant and other treatments 
The use of any natural/herbal products or other traditional remedies should be discouraged, 
but use of these products, as well as use of all vitamins, nutritional supplements, and all other concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF.
Medications that may NOT be administered
No other anti-cancer therapy (chemother apy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy [hormone 
replacement therapy is acceptable], radiotherapy, biological therapy, or ot her novel agent) is 
to be permitted while the subject is receiving study medication.
Live virus and live bacterial vaccines should not  be administered whilst the subject is 
receiving study medication and during the 30-d ay follow-up period. An increased risk of 
infection by [CONTACT_907404].
Restricted concomitant medications
Strong or Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted 
protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) should not 
be taken with olaparib.
If there is no suitable alternative concomitant medication, then the dose of olaparib should be 
reduced for the period of concomitant administration. The dose reduction of olaparib should 
be recorded in the CRF with the reason documented as concomitant CYP3A inhibitor use.
# Strong CYP3A inhibitors – reduce the dose of olaparib to 100 mg bidfor 
the duration of concomitant therapy wi th the strong inhibitor and for 
5 half-lives afterwards.
# Moderate CYP3A inhibitors – reduce the dose of olaparib to 150 mg bid
for the duration of concomitant therapy with the moderate inhibitor and 
for 3 half-lives afterwards.

Strong or Moderate CYP3A inducers
Strong (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enzalutamide, and St John’s Wort) and moderate CYP3A i nducers (e.g., bosentan, 
efavirenz, modafinil) of CYP3A should not be taken with olaparib.
If the use of any strong or moderate CYP3A inducers are considered necessary for the 
subject’s safety and welfare, this could diminish the clinical efficacy of olaparib.
If a subject requires use of a strong or moderate CY P3A inducer then they must be monitored 
carefully for any change in efficacy of olaparib.
P-gp inhibitors
It is possible that co-administration of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, azithromycin) may 
increase exposure to olaparib. Ca ution should th erefore be observed.
Effect of olaparib on other drugs
Based on limited in vitro data, olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, 
P-gp, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2K. 
Based on limited in vitro data, olaparib may reduce the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, 
2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and P-gp. 
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-administered with olaparib. Caution should therefore be observed if substr ates of these isoenzymes or transporter proteins 
are co-administered.Examples of substrates include:
# CYP3A4 – hormonal contraceptive, simvastatin, cisapride, cyclosporine, 
ergot alkaloids, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], sirolimus, tacrolimus and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]
# CYP2B6 – bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], efavirenz
# CYP2C9 – warfarin 
# CYP2C19 – lansoprazole, omeprazole, S-mephenytoin
# P-gp – simvastatin, pravastatin, digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine
# OATP1B1 – bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, statins, valsartan

Anticoagulant therapy
Oral anticoagulants are permitted. Subjects who are taking warfarin may participate in this 
study; however, it is recommended that INR be monitored carefully at least once per week for 
the first month, then monthly thereafter, if the INR is stable. For Coumadin-like agents, 
prothrombin time should be checked at baselin e and followed closely (as clinically indicated).
Subcutaneous heparin and low molecular weight heparin are permitted. 
Anti-emetics/Anti-diarrheals
From screening onwards, shoul d a subject develop nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, then 
these symptoms should be reported as adverse events (see Section 6) and appropriate 
treatment of the event should be given.
Palliative radiotherapy 
Palliative radiotherapy may be used for the treatment of pain at the site of bony metastases 
that were present at baseline, provided the Investigator does not feel that these are indicative 
of clinical disease progression during the study  period.  Study treatment should be 
discontinued for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1273800] undergoes therapeutic palliative 
radiation treatment.  Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone 
marrow toxicity has recovered (i.e., if a subject has not recovered from bone marrow toxicity within 4 weeks they should be discontinued from the study).  
Administration of other anti-cancer agents
Subjects must not receive any other concurrent anti-cancer therapy, including investigational 
agents, while on study treatment. Subjects may continue the use of bisphosphonates or 
denosumab for bone disease and corticosteroids for the symptomatic control of brain 
metastases provided the dose is stable before and during the study and they were started at

[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of response
The DoR will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response (that is

PD.  The end of response should coincide with the date of PD or death from any cause used 
for the PFS endpoint.  The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates 
contributing towards the first visit response of PR or CR.  If the response is not confirmed (per 
RECIST v1.1), it will not be included.  If a subject does not progress following a response, 
then the subject’s DoR will use the PFS censoring time.

The CA-125 response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving a CA-125 
response.  The CA-125 CR Rate is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving a CA-125 
response with the CA- 125 level additionally falling within the normal range. The CA-125 
response rate will be analyzed on a subset of the efficacy analysis set (i.e., excluding subjects 
whose baseline CA- 125 level is not ∀2 × ULN and/or not assessed within 2 weeks of starting 
treatment with olaparib) ( Rustin et al 2011 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease control rate
The DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects who have a best overall response of 
confirmed CR or PR or SD at ∀ 8 weeks divided by [CONTACT_907385], prior to any PD event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-free survival
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from  the date of first dose of olaparib until the 
date of objective radiological disease progression (Investigator assessed via RECIST v1.1) or 
death (by [CONTACT_347054]) regardless of whether the subject withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to disease progression.  
Subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time 
of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable efficacy assessment.  However, if the subject progresses or dies after [ADDRESS_1273807] evaluable assessment.  Given the scheduled visit assessment scheme, 
2 missing visits will equate to more than 18 weeks (or 26 weeks after 1 year) since the previous RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1273808] a baseline asse ssment, they will be censored at Day 1 unless 
they die within 2 visits of baseline (18 weeks allowing for visit window).  
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates and not visit dates.  
Assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on different 
dates.  The following rules will be applied:
# Date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the 
assessment/scan dates of the component that triggered the progression.  
# When censoring a subject for PFS, the subject will be censored at the latest of the assessment/scan dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment.

Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with  ICH/GCP, applicable regulatory requirements,
and the [COMPANY_008] policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples.
10.[ADDRESS_1273825] data protection
The Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a 
separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislation.
[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genotype re sults to subjects, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician, or any other third party, unless 
required to do so by [CONTACT_2371] .
Precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the subject.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject.  For example, in the case of a 
medical emergency, an [COMPANY_008] Representative Study Physician or an Investigator might 
know a subject’s identity a nd also have access to her genetic data.  Also, Regulatory 
Authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the sub ject’s medical information 
and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
10.[ADDRESS_1273826] (IRB) should approve the final Clinical Study Protocol, 
including the final version of the Informed Consent Form and any other written information 
and/or materials to be provided to the subjects.  The Investigator will ensure the distribution of 
these documents to the applicable IRB, and to the study site staff.

Date 10 October 2017
115 (138)Appendix A Additional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
event as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in 
the subject’s death.  ‘Life-th reatening’ does not mean that had an adverse event occurred in a 
more severe form, it might have caused death (e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic 
failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907361], although the reasons for it 
may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not  considered adverse events if the illness or 
disease existed before the subject was enrolled in  the study, provided that it did not deteriorate 
in an unexpected wa y during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, or incapacity, but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_1273838] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
# Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring 
intravenous hydrocortisone treatment;
# Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose 
requiring treatment wi th N-acetylcysteine;
# Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm;
# Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neut ropenia or anemia requiring bl ood 
transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059]; or
# Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Date 10 October 2017
116 (138)A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causality, consider the following factors when deciding if 
there is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
# Time Course.  Exposure to susp ect drug.  Has the subject actually 
received the suspect drug?  Did the adverse event occur in a reasonable 
temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?
# Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the adverse event consistent 
with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and 
toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the adverse event be anticipated fro m its pharmacological properties?
# De-challenge experience.  Did the adverse event resolve or improve on 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76357]?
# No alternative cause.  The adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_169978], other drugs, other host, or environmental factors.
# Re-challenge experience.  Did the adverse event reoccur if the suspected 
drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not 
normally r ecommend or support a re-ch allenge.
# Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has 
confirmed the relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered, such as:
# Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
# Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is  meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related.’
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

117 (138)Appendix B International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.[ADDRESS_1273839] samples
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 
3 categories.  For transport purposes, the classification of infectious substances according to 
risk groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations in the 46th edition (2005).  
Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B, or Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disa bility, or life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are (e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever 
virus):
# Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens include, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shippi[INVESTIGATOR_72919]:
# UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B; 
# Are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650.
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens:
# Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA 
regulations;
# Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at 
ambient temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging;
# Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry-ice content;
# IATA compliant courier and packag ing materials should be used for 
packing and transportation, and packing should be done by [CONTACT_73013], as applicable; and

120 (138)For all samples, irrespective of the type of coding used, the DNA will be extracted from the 
blood sample.  The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information 
on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by [CONTACT_479992].  The DNA number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the 
[COMPANY_008] genetics la boratories, or at the designated contract laboratory.  No personal 
details identifying the individual will be available to any person ([COMPANY_008] Representative 
employee or contract laboratory staff working with the DNA).
The samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  The link between 
the subject enrollment/randomization code a nd the DNA number will be maintained and 
stored in a secure environment, with restricted access WITHIN the Clinical Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_479930] (LIMS)  at [COMPANY_008].  The link will be used 
to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results 
with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, an d trace samples for destruction in the case of 
withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory requir ements for the study, including this genetics 
research component, are outlined in Section 10of the main Clinical Study Protocol.
Subject data protection[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genotype re sults to subjects, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician, or any other third party, unless 
required to do so by [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the subject.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject.  For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency, an [COMPANY_008] Physician  or an Investigator might know a subject’s 
identity and also have access to her genetic data.  Also, Regulatory Authorities may require 
access to the relevant files, though the subject’s  medical information and the genetic files 
would remain physically separate.
Data management
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored in the [COMPANY_008] genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_479958], or other appropriate secure system within [COMPANY_008] and/or third party contracted to work with [COMPANY_008] to analyze the samples.
The results from this genetic research may be reported in the Clinical Study Report for the 
main study, or in a separate report as appropriate.
Genotype data will be transferred to the clinical database, and merged with the clinical data 
from the main study, prior to the statistical analysis and reporting of the study.

Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.  Specific guidance on the managing liver abnormalities can 
be found in Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_1273841] meets 
potential Hy’s Law criteria at any point during the study.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting potential Hy’s Law criteria to agree whether Hy’s 
Law criteria are met.  Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than drug induced liver injury caused by [CONTACT_10853].  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to potential Hy’s Law/Hy’s Law
cases and for reporting adverse events and se rious adverse event (SAE) according to the 
outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
Definitions

(ALP).  
Hy’s Law AST or ALT ∀3 × ULN together with TBL ∀2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the investigational medicinal product, can be found to explain the combination of increases, 
(e.g., elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug).  
For potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law the elevation in transaminases must precede or be 
coincident with (i.e., on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified 
timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

Follow-up
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the subject does not meet potential Hy’s Law criteria, the Investigator will:
# Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the 
guidance provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the subject meets potential Hy’s Law criteria, the Investigator will:
# Notify the [COMPANY_008] Representative who will then inform the central

Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this section should be followed for all cases where potential Hy’s Law
criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_1273842] the Investigator in order to review 
available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting potential 
Hy’s Law criteria other than drug-induced liver injury caused by [CONTACT_887323].  The [COMPANY_008] Medical Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be 
involved in this review, together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the 
instructions below.
If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an adverse event w ill be made, and 
subsequently, whether the adverse event meets the criteria for an SAE:
# If the alternative explanation is not an adverse event, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate eCRF; or
# If the alternative explanation is an adverse event/SAE, record the adverse 
event/SAE in the eCRF accordingly and follow the [COMPANY_008] standard
processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the investigational medicinal product:
# Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] 
standard processes.  
∃The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply, and

Date 10 October 2017
125 (138)∃As there is no alternative explanation for the Hy’s Law case, a causality 
assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If there is an unavoidable delay of over 3 w eeks in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for Hy’s Law, then it is assumed that there is 
no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
# Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality assessment as per above.
# Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and 
assessment to determine whether Hy’s Law criteria are met.  Update the 
SAE report according to the outcome of the review.
Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting 
Study Treatment 
This section is applicable to s ubjects with live r metastases who m eet potential Hy’s Law
criteria on study treatment, having previously met potential Hy’s Law criteria at a study visit 
prior to starting study treatment.
At the first on-study treatment occurrence of potential Hy’s Law criteria being met the 
Investigator will:
# Determine if there has been a significant change in the subjects’ condition
*compared with the last visit where potential Hy’s Law criteria 
were met*:
∃If there is no significant change, no action is required; or
∃If there is a significant change, notify the [COMPANY_008] Representative, who 
will inform the central study team, then follow the subsequent process 
described in “ Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met ” of this Appendix.
*A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s conditi on refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this 
may be in consultation with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertainty.
Actions Required for Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33099]’s Law
This section is applicable when a subject meets  potential Hy’s Law criteria on study tr eatment 
and has already met potential Hy’s Law criteria at a previous on-study treatment visit.

Date 10 October 2017
126 (138)The requirement to conduct follow-up, review, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
potential Hy’s Law is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous 
occurrence.  
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of potential Hy’s 
Law criteria being met and answer the following question:
# Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of potential Hy’s 
Law criteria being met found to be the diseas e under study e.g., chronic 
or progressing malignant disease, seve re infection, or liver disease, or did 
the subject meet potential Hy’s Law criteria prior to starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in “Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and 
After Starting Study Treatment ?”
If No: follow the process described in “ Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met ” of this Appendix.
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condition
*compared 
with when potential Hy’s Law criteria were previously met:
# If there is no significant change, no action is required; or
# If there is a significant change, follow the process described in this Appendix.
*A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s conditi on refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this 
may be in consultation with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertainty.

Measurability of Tumor at Baseline
Definitions
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
# 10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm);
# 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable); or 
# [ADDRESS_1273845] X-ray.
Measurable malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ∀[ADDRESS_1273846] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline (i.e., screening for this 
study) and in follow-up (i.e., all measurements past screening for this study), only the short 
axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below on “Baseline documentation of 
target and non-targeted lesions (TLs)” for information on lymph node measurement.
Non-measurable
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ∀10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions 
considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast diseas e, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly id entified by [CONTACT_201782].

131 (138)Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previ ously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment.
Bone Lesions
# Bone scan, positron emission tomogra phy scan or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techni ques to measure bone lesions.  
However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.
# Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blas tic lesions, with identifiable soft 
tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging 
techniques such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability described above.
# Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
Cystic Lesions
# Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically-defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as mali gnant lesions (neither measurable nor 
non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
# “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability 
described above.  However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as TLs.
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment
# Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
Specifications by [CONTACT_664246], using calipers, if clinically assessed.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and 
NEVER more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.

132 (138)Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline a nd during follow-up.  Imag ing-based evaluation 
should always be performed rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but is assessable by [CONTACT_461].
Computed tomography, MRI: CT is the best  currently available and reproducible method to 
measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1273847] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness.  An MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for 
body scans).
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit,  however, they must normalize for a subject 
to be considered in complete response. 
Tumor Response Evaluation
Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall 
tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. 
Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-target” Lesions
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (representative of all involved organs) should be identified as target lesions 
(TLs) and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where subjects 
have only 1 or 2 organ sites involved, a maximum of 2 and 4 lesions, respectively, will be 
recorded).
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), 
should be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they ar e normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490].  As noted above, pathological nodes which 
are defined as measurable and may be identified as TLs must meet the criterion of a short axis 
of ∀[ADDRESS_1273848] 
in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the 
plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the 
short axis.  For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix G
Drug Substance Olaparib
Study Code D0816L00003Version 3.0
Date 10 October 2017
133 (138)short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm 
should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short 
axis ∀10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-TLs. Nodes that have a short axis 
< 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesion s, short axis for nodal lesions) for all TLs 
will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified 
as non-TLs and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these 
lesions should be followed as “present,” “abse nt,” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”  
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-TLs involving the same organ as a single item 
on the case record form (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver 
metastases”).  
Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all TLs.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note: The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as TLs should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on  study.  This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as TLs, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a 
normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD, and PD, the 
actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of TLs.

Date 10 October 2017
134 (138)Target lesions that become “too small to measure”: While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very s mall (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or 
lymph nodes which are recorded as TLs at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the 
radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an  exact measure and may report them as being 
“too small to measure.”  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded in the 
electronic case report form.  If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_907362], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually 
have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  
This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_1273849] slice thickness (but should not be changed 
with varying CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible; therefore, providing this default value will prevent false responses or 
progressions based upon measurement error.  To reiterate,  however, if the radiologist is able to 
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non-nodal lesions “fragment,” the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the TL sum.  
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion.”
Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the cr iteria used to determine the tumor response for 
the group of non-TLs.  While some non-TLs may actu ally be measurable, they need not be 
measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the 
Clinical Study Protocol.  
CR: Disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes 
must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker 
level above the normal limits.
PD: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-TLs (Note: The 
appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease re quires additional explanation as follows, 
when the subject also has measurable disease.  In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non-target dis ease, there must be an overall level of 
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix G
Drug Substance Olaparib
Study Code D0816L00003Version 3.0
Date 10 October 2017
135 (138)substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target 
disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of 
therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of 1 or more non-TLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on 
the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will 
therefore be extremely rare.  
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion s hould be 
unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent so mething other than tum or (for example, some 
“new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions).  This is particularly 
important when the subject’s baseline lesions show PR or CR.  For example, necrosis of a 
liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain
scan ordered which reveals metastases.  The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be 
evidence of PD, even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment.  No confirmatory measurement for CR, PR, or SD is required in the study.
The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and 
non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.
Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol-specified time point, a response assessment will occur.

136 (138)Table 14 Time Point Response: Subjects with Target ( %%Non-target) Disease
Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is performed at all at a particular time point, the subject is not 
evaluable at that time point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consid ered not evaluable at that time point, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) 
would not change the assigned time point response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a subject had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_1273851] Overall Response: All Time Points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known.
Best response determination in studies where confirmation of CR or PR IS NOT required:
Best response in these studies is defined as the best response across all time points (e.g., a 
subject who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet 
the Clinical Study Protocol-specified minimum t ime from baseline.  If the minimum time is 
not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response 
depends on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a subject who has SD at first 
assessment, PD at second, and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best

137 (138)response of PD.  The same subject lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be 
considered inevaluable.
Best response determination in trials where con firmation of complete or partial response IS 
required: Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at 
a subsequent time point as specified in the Clin ical Study Protocol. In this circumstance, the 
best overall response can be interpreted as in Table [ADDRESS_1273852] Overall Response When Confirmation of CR and PR is Required
Special Notes on Response Assessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of TLs and the nodes decrease to “normal” size 
(< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement re ported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal, in order not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” in the electronic case report form.
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symp tomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of 
such subjects is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease.
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

3 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Overview of Psoriasis  
Psoriasis is a chronic immunological disease characterized by [CONTACT_782181] 
T cells and by [CONTACT_397426], resulting in marked 
inflammation and thickening of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Psoriasis affects 1-3% of the world population, 
making it one of the most prevalent inflammatory immunological diseases.1  There are several 
clinical subtypes of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, erythrodermic, inverse, and pustular.  Plaque 
psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis affecting 75-80% of psoriasis sufferers.² It 
presents as raised silvery scale, which can cover large areas, with underlying erythema, itching, 
and discomfort.

[IP_ADDRESS]     Topi[INVESTIGATOR_782173]® Dosage Adjustments 
If an SAE or an adverse event that is thought to be related to Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800] ® and is not alleviated by 
[CONTACT_397431], Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® will be discontinued.  Subjects who permanently discontinue 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® therapy under this protocol should receive standard care of psoriasis treatment as 
prescribed by [CONTACT_9682]. 
 
5.5.2  Permitted Concomitant Therapy 
Subjects may use non-steroidal topi[INVESTIGATOR_782174], groin and axilla. Patients may apply 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_782173]® on arms, legs and trunk to treat body psoriasis. Appropriate interventions (e.g., 
prescribed medications) may be performed as the investigator deems necessary to treat 
concomitant illnesses and/or safeguard the subjects’ wellbeing.  No investigational product or 
device may be used during the study.   
5.6 Study Procedures 
5.6.1 Informed Consent 
This Study will be conducted in compliance with CFR Title 21, Part 50 (Informed Consent of 
Human Subjects).  Informed consent will be obtained from each subject in writing before 
participation in the Study.  A signed copy of the Informed Consent Form will be provided to each 
subject.  A provision to obtain a signed authorization to provide protected health information to 
JB-[ADDRESS_1075589] (HIPAA) 
privacy regulation will be included in the Informed Consent Document.  HIPAA authorization is 
voluntary.  However, since the use and release of health information is critical to the conduct of 
the study, subjects who do not provide authorization to use and disclose their health information 
will not be enrolled into the study.  Subjects who withdraw their authorization to use and release 
health information during study participation will be formally discontinued from the study.  The 
investigator may use and release at any time all the information collected prior to a subject’s 
withdrawal of the authorization to all authorized parties to satisfy scientific, regulatory, and 
financial concerns. 
5.6.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study will be determined according to the Inclusion and 
Exclusion Criteria during the screening period (0 – [ADDRESS_1075590] dose of the study 
drug).  Subjects who ultimately do not satisfy the eligibility criteria except changing treatments 
and undergoing a washout period, will not be enrolled into the study.  Subjects who need to meet 
eligibility requirements will be asked to make the necessary changes.  Subjects who agree and 
comply will be re-evaluated prior to Baseline.  Subjects who meet the requirements at screening 
may be enrolled the same day. 
5.6.[ADDRESS_1075591] during screening: date of birth, sex, 
race/ ethnic origin, relevant medical and surgical history, year of diagnosis of plaque psoriasis 
and scalp psoriasis, and current and previous anti-psoriasis treatments within the last [ADDRESS_1075592] 
Pregnancy testing (urine β-human chorionic gonadotrophin [β-HCG]) will be conducted in all 
female subjects, except those without childbearing potential (e.g., one year post-menopause, 
post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, etc) at Screening and Baseline Visit (Week 0) 
prior to the first dose of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]®.  An interim urine pregnancy test may be performed if there is 
reason to believe the subject may have become pregnant during the study.  Subjects with a 
positive pregnancy test will not be eligible to participate or to continue to receive study treatment. 
5.6.5 Physical Examination 
A physical examination, including vital signs measurements (blood pressure and pulse), will be 
performed at each study visit. Any clinically significant abnormalities discovered during physical 
JB-02  Version 1      05Apr2016 
 
10 
 examinations after the Screening / Baseline (if occurring on the same day) visit should be 
documented and evaluated as potential adverse events. 
 
5.6.6 Investigator Global Assessment (scalp only )  
Investigator Global Assessment for scalp will be determined for all subjects throughout the study.  
Subjects are required to have a score of 2-mild or greater to enter the study.  The Investigator 
Global Assessment is a 5 point scale that records disease severity based on average degree of 
erythema, induration and scaling. Investigator Global Assessment uses a scale of 0 = Clear, 1 = 
Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, and 4 = Severe. See Appendix A 
 
5.6.7 Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) and Scalp Surface Area (SSA) 
The scalp is assessed for erythema, induration and desquamation. The average degree of 
severity of each 3 symptoms is assigned a score of 0-4.  The surface area of scalp psoriasis is 
then estimated as a percentage. The PSSI score is the sum of the erythema, induration and 
desquamation scores multiplied by [CONTACT_82755]. Scores range from 0-72.  See 
Appendix B 
5.6.8 Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)  
PGA will be determined for all subjects throughout the study. PGA is a 5 point scale that records 
the overal l disease severity at each clinical evaluation based on the average degree of erythema, 
induration, and scaling of areas affected by [CONTACT_22803].  PGA uses a scale of 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost 
Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, and 4 = Severe. See Appendix C 
 
5.6.9  Body Surface Area (BSA) 
BSA will be determined for all subjects throughout the study. The subjects palm will be selected 
for the measuring unit of body surface area.  The physician will equate the number of palms 
affected by [CONTACT_397436].

 5.6.11   Early Discontinuation Procedures 
Subjects will be prematurely discontinued from the study under the following conditions: 
1. Subject requests to withdraw from the study. 
2. Subject is noncompliant with protocol schedule, restrictions, and/or requirements. 
3. Subject experiences an adverse event that makes it difficult or intolerable for the 
subject to continue treatment, or increases risk to the subject, or interferes with the 
investigator’s ability to clinically evaluate the progress of the subject’s treatment. 
4. Subject begins an unapproved concomitant therapy for psoriasis or another medical 
condition that may increase risk to the subject if continuing study treatment. 
5. Subject cannot be reached / lost to follow- up. 
6. The study investigator suspends or terminates the study. 
7. Other unanticipated reason. 
 
Any subject who prematurely discontinues the study should complete the week 16 (End of Study) 
assessments. Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from 
further treatment and/or study observation immediately upon the date of request.  
6 Adverse Events 
6.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward occurrence in a subject, whether or not related to the 
product.  An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study treatment.  
AEs include events not present at baseline and events that worsened if present at baseline. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643]-treatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic procedures) or surgeries that 
were planned prior to entry into the study are not considered adverse events.  
 
Adverse events, regardless of causality , will be captured from the signing of the Informed Consent 
Form and for the duration of the subject’s participation. 
6.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one or more of 
the following criteria according to federal regulations: 
 
a. results in death; 
b. is life-threatening (the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not 
refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); 
c. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
d. requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
e. is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
JB-02  Version 1      05Apr2016 
 
12 
 f. is considered an important medical event (may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_782175]). 
 
 
6.2 .1 SAE Reporting 
An Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction  is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death;  
 A life threatening adverse event; (Note: the term “life-threatening” as used here 
refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe);  
 In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions); 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Any “other” important medical event. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531969], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Regardless of the above, any additional adverse events which the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_782176]’s Drug Safety Department. 
Any Serious Adverse Event, whether deemed drug-related or not, must be reported by [CONTACT_782185]’s Drug Safety Department by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours  after the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_782177].  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287782]’s Designee must complete a Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) Form and email it to Taro’s Drug Safety Department, along with the patient’s Adverse 
Events Log and Concomitant Medications Log within 24 hours  of notification of the event.  
When appropriate, Taro’s Drug Safety Department will notify the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) of drug related Serious Adverse Events.

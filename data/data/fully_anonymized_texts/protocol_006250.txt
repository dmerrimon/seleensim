Background:  Whether the several classes of influenza vaccines are equivalent or not in 
children is unclear.  Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, FluMist), offers a nasal 
administration route which may result in higher vaccination rates  [1].  Data fr om 2015 -16 
showed LAIV had lower effectiveness in children aged 2- 17 years [2, 3] .  Starting in 
2018- 19, LAIV was reformulated, with attention to the H1N1 construct, and re- offered as 
an Advis ory Committee on Immunization Practice- (ACIP)  approved vaccine choice.  
Cell-culture inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV4, Flucelvax) is another approved option 
for children aged [ADDRESS_635367] number of paired PBMC sets.  This study will be extended 
into 2020- 21 in order to:  
Compare the serologic responses to cell culture- based quadrivalent influenza vaccine 
(ccIIV [Flucelvax]) versus live attenuated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (LAIV [FluMist]) 
in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among racially diverse children/young adults 4- 21 
years of age. The primary endpoint is change in antibody titer.   The s econdary Aims are 
to:  1. Compare the immune responses between ccIIV and LAIV; 2. The nasal 
microbiome may both effect and be affected by [CONTACT_33853] (2019 only) ;  
Methods:  An unblinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted by [CONTACT_493792][INVESTIGATOR_9109].  Randomization to either LAIV or ccIIV on a 1:1 ratio will be done in blocks of 4.  Depending on funding, 
up to 2 40-260 will be randomized; assuming a 16% drop- out rate  (21% in children under 
9 and 11% in ages 9 and up) this would result in approximately 200 participants.  Efforts 
will be made to recruit /include children 4-8 years  and persons not vaccinated in 2019 -20 
for comparison of immune response to those previously vaccinated in 20 19-20 .  Young 
persons aged 4- 21 years without a contraindication to LAIV who plan to receive 
seasonal influenza vaccination at one of our recruiting sites are eligible to participate.  
The primary endpoint s are change in antibody titers .  Given that LAIV is known to 
produce limited IgG [4], other potential beneficial responses to nasal administration of 
intranasal LAIV compared to ccIIV will be examined as secondary endpoints , including 
changes in serum IgA.  Titer  levels will be log transformed and reported as  
seropositivity, mean fold rise (MFR) and seroconversion.   Specimens will be collected 
on a subset of participants for c ell-mediated immune responses to be studied at CDC  
and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887] .

 Introduction  
Influenza is a major public health burden, each year causing millions of illnesses and 
outpatient visits and tens of thousands of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493778] U.S. The primary influenza prevention method is vaccination; however, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is variable. Host factors (e.g., age and antibody landscape), 
environment (e.g., tobacco exposure), virus and vaccine characteristics, such as the 
match between the vaccine and circulating strains and the type of vaccine, contribute to VE. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) sets civilian 
immunization policy for the [LOCATION_002] and has no preference among influenza 
vaccine products  [5].  This project will quantify pre- and post influenza immune 
response to different influenza vaccine types.  
LAIV has a storied past. When the formulation was still a trivalent one, a metanalyses 
showed LAIV to have superior VE and, for one season,  was the ACIP preferred vaccine 
for children 2- 8 years of age [6]. LAIV was previously shown to be more effective than 
IIV against antigenically different or drifted strains —thus, egg -based LAIV may provide 
broader protection than I IV. However, after introduction of the quadrivalent formulation, 
data from 2015- 16 showed that LAIV ’s  effectiveness was low in those aged 2- 17 years  
[7], resulting in ACIP recommending  against its use [8].   The manufact urer has since 
reformulated LAIV,  specifically the H1N1 component, and it was included as a 
vaccination option in ACIP’s recommendations, starting in 2018- 19 [5].  Howe ver, its 
late reintroduction and initial disagreement by [CONTACT_493793], led to limited up take in the US .  
In a community trial of trivalent products in adults aged 18- 49 years in 2007- 8, IIV was 
efficacious whereas LAIV was not   [9].  In a military population in 2006 -7, the duration in 
years of being vaccine -naïve was correlated with trivalent LAIV effectiveness but not 
with trivale nt IIV effectiveness [10] and the effect of vaccination was statistically 
significant for LAIV ( P=0.04) but not for TIV ( P=0.63).    
Cell-culture inactivated influenza vaccine (Flucelvax) was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2012, 
and includes cell seed strains  for all four components starting in [ADDRESS_635368] 
closely approximates the antigenicity of the influenza viruses circulating at the time of vaccine strain selection [11].  Among elderly persons in 2017- 18, vaccine effectiveness 
was 10% greater for cell -cultured influenza vaccines relative to egg -based quadrivalent 
vaccines [12], however limited data are available for children and teens .  
There are several factors that may complicate the serological immune response to LAIV.  Compared to adults, children have been shown to have a significant IgA response to LAIV [4] which may afford protection not demonstrable by [CONTACT_493794].  
In addition, the presence of different microbial species in the nose, as well LAIV -related 
5 
 
5 
 alterations in the microbial species present in the nose, may result in variations in IgA 
antibody production [13].   
Another consideration in vaccine response is the individual’s prior vaccine history.  Both 
T cells and B cells are required for effective immunity to influenza infection and vaccination. B cells secrete antibodies, which represent a major likely corr elate of 
vaccine- mediated protection. T cells play two potential roles: first, CD8+ T cells can 
directly recognize and kill influenza- infected cells, and second, antibody production 
requires "help" from CD4+ T cells. The relative contributions of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells 
to influenza immunity in humans is less clearly understood than is the role of B -cell-
secreted antibodies, but all these responses are likely to be important in controlling 
influenza virus replication. Children are likely to have different imm une response profiles 
against influenza from adults, since each person’s immune “repertoire” is shaped by 
[CONTACT_5657]/her lifetime exposure to influenza viruses. Most adults have been infected with 
and/or vaccinated against influenza multiple times in their lives. T herefore, t hey enter 
each influenza season with a pre- existing repertoire of “memory” responses against 
virus strains to which they have been exposed previously, which may cross -react to 
varying degrees with antigens in the current  season’s vaccine. In contrast, children have 
few or no lifetime influenza infections and have few er pre-existing memory responses 
when infected or vaccinated.  A better understanding of the humoral and cell -mediated 
immune response to repeat influenza vaccination and different influenza vaccine types (LAIV and ccIIV) in children and teens  with and without a recent history of vaccination is 
needed.  
This study is the first head -to-head comparison of the current versions of LAIV and 
ccIIV, both of which are FDA-approved options for children aged 4 years and older.   We 
will compare the differences in response among children/teens  who were unvaccinated 
in the previous year in a randomized trial.  We will also focus our recruitment efforts on 
children ages 4- 8 years old, regardless of prior vaccination status, as this  group was 
under -represented in 2019- 20.  The data on responses to repeated doses of ccIIV and 
of LAIV are limited and this study will enable determination of those responses by 
[CONTACT_493795] 2019- 20 and randomly as signing 
them to receive LAIV or ccIIV .

 A. Specific Aim s: 
Primary Aim   
Compare the serologic  responses  to cell culture- based quadrivalent  influenza vaccine (ccIIV  
[Flucelvax])  versus live attenuated quadrivalent  influenza vaccine (LAIV  [FluMist])  in a 
randomized  controlled trial (RCT)  among racially  diverse children/young adults  4-21 years  of 
age. The primary  endpoint  is change in antibody  titer. 
a. Serology —based on hemagglutination inhibition  assay  (HAI)  titers:  Hypotheses:  Mean fold 
rise (MFR) based on HAI titers  and seroconversion will differ  between LAIV  and ccIIV.  
 
Secondary Aims:  
1. Compare  the immune responses  between  ccIIV  and LAIV.  
2. The nasal  microbiome  may both effect and be affected by [CONTACT_33853] (2019 only)  
  
B. Study Desi gn and Methods  
B.1 Study Design and population Years 1 and 2 combined  
1. Total  number  of subjects  to be enrolled  at this site up to 480 enrolled  over two years  
(of up to 650 screened ) 
2. Describe  and explain the study  design:  
This study  will be an unblinded randomized  controlled  trial of 200-220 (2019)  and up 
to 260 (2020)  children,  adolescents  and young  adults  to examine their immune  
response following  influenza vaccination. For 2020,  all participants  will have a 
baseline  draw  and a Day 28 (range  21-35 days) blood draw.  A subset  of up to [ADDRESS_635369] a blood draw  on Day 7 (range  6-9 days)  
3. Describe  the primary  and secondary  study  endpoints:  
Primary:  
-Seroconversion based  on hemagglutinin inhibition  (HAI) titers  
Secondar y: 
- Day 0 and Day 28 Seroprotection based  on HAI titers  
- Day 0 and Day 28 geometric  mean  comparisons  of HAI titers  
The overall  purpose is to understand  immune  responses  related to influenza 
vaccination and their determinants.  We will also look at serum  IgG and IgA, cell 
mediated immunity  indices , transcriptomics, genomic,  protonomic,  cell-mediated 
immunity , nasal  micro biome  (2019 only)  and/or  past vaccine experience effects  on 
the immune  response  to influenza vaccination.  
 
 
B.[ADDRESS_635370] a blood draw at baseline and at Day 28 (range 21- 35 days) .  A 
subset (up to 120) of participants ages [ADDRESS_635371] a blood draw at  Day 7 (range 6- 9 
days ). 
[ADDRESS_635372] at the time of the study  because a) the Day [ADDRESS_635373] 
laboratory results ; and b) the main student  body is leaving the University in mid 
November  per 2020 University policy.  Therefore, we anticipate a possible  enrollment 
decrease of 10% per week , given that the  enrollment period has been  shortened) ; and 
c)extra protections in place for participant and worker safety; this limits throughput due to the extra cleaning and social distancing requirements. (T he University has granted 
official permission for this study in the Fall of 2020 after special application).  
Recruitment and enrollment of the  study population will take place at  family medicine 
and pediatric clinics as well as at other sites,  such as  the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109].    
Screening for eligibility will be conducted by a Research Assistant either via phone, online,  or in person with data entered directly into REDCap, a secure online database 
management system.  (For screening eligibility surveys that are conducted via paper, 
information collected on this form will be entered into REDCap post-hoc.)  Research 
assistants will meet with parents of potentially eligible children, or young adults  
themselves , to review study requirements and  the consent form , giving parents /patients  
time to read through it thoroughly  and answer questions.  Then research assistant will 
obtain parental or young adult consent and child/teen assent .  For research assistants 
without medical t raining, a physician or doctoral level pharmacist will be  available either 
in person or via electronic device to review the study protocol and vaccine choices  and 
answer any questions the parents and/or child/teen or young adult may have.  
Remotely, writte n informed consent may also be collected after performing screening 
procedures, but prior to performing any of the research interventions/interactions. A 
REDCap PDF of the consent form will be emailed to the potential participant and 
reviewed with them. The participant receives the email and clicks on a link to see the 
consent. If they agree, they initiate the electronic consent process within REDCap, sign 
and submit the form. The signed consent document is stored securely in REDCap. The 
consenting party wi ll document that they consented the participant by [CONTACT_493796]’s consent to complete the fields on the electronic consent form or by a 
note to file in the participant record.

B.2.2 Enrollment  
Targeted enrollment numbe rs 
Targete d enrollment is up to 130 individuals  in each vaccine arm  for 2020.  
Approximately  ½ of the subjects would be recruited from  our returning 2019- 2020 
vaccinated cohort of patients with three prior visits .   Among non- cohort recruits, we will 
prioritize  persons ages 4- 8 years regardless of 2019- 20 vaccination status and persons 
9-21 years who were not vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine in the 2019- 20 
seas on. Enrollm ent in this study will begin after IRB and CDC approval is obtained and 
will continue until the target sample size for each group is reached with the goal of 
completing all baseline study visits by [CONTACT_493798].  We will recruit 
from primary care and pediatric locations  such as  UPMC Shadyside Family Health 
Center; Children’s Community Pediatrics (CCP) Primary Care Oakland; and, perhaps,  
East Liberty Family Health Center .  We will also recruit past participants who were 
vaccinated at Falk Pharmacy.  Because the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me database was highly successful in 
2019- 20, we will use it to recruit  new participants .  Inclusion of older t eenagers  and 
young adults  aged 18 -21 years allow s for college students  using Falk pharmacy , as well 
as returning cohort members .

B.2.4 Enrollment procedures: Data and Blood S ample Collection  
B.2.4.1a Enrollment  visit  
Eligible patients who agree to enroll will be consented prior to conducting further 
baseline visit enrollment procedures .  Written  informed consent includes permission to 
access medical records and/or state registry records to obtain data related to medical 
history, medication use, vitals, high- risk codes, and vaccination history.   
A survey of demographics and health status will be collected at baseline, or if 
insufficient time, at a follow -up study visit. Data will be entered directly into REDCap (or 
if collected via paper will be entered into REDCap post -hoc.)  
All participants will have blood drawn at baseline enrollment visit (may be done during 
the summer prior to vaccination). Refer to Table  for blood volumes and tube types to be 
collected. The total blood volume for a particular participant is based on several factors 
including size of the participant's veins, limitations on number of PBMC specimens that the lab can process in a particular day, past PBMC yield from the participant (if known), enrollment site, past vaccination status, and courier transportation availability, given the 
need to process PBMCs quickly.  
Upon consent , participa nts will be randomized to one of two vaccine types ( LAIV  or 
ccIIV ) using a 1:1 computer generated simple randomization schem e.  Randomization 
block size will be  conducted in sets of  four (2 LAIV  and 2 ccIIV ). 
 
  
[ADDRESS_635376] clinical protocol.   This visit may occur at the time of the enrollment visit 
provided that  the vaccine to which the participant is randomized is available.  
B.2--4.1c Blood draw procedures   
All blood will be collected by [CONTACT_493799].  The blood samples will be collected using Vacutainer tubes, appropriate for type of processing, and appropriately labeled with a uniform scheme (including study ID 
and collection time point).   
Serum specimens will be aliquoted and frozen.  Individual aliquots will be either shipped to CDC for analysis, analyzed by [CONTACT_493800][INVESTIGATOR_493780] , or banked for future studies that might i nvolve proteomics, immunology, 
transcriptomics, or genomics. . 
B.2.4.[ADDRESS_635377] a blood draw at Day 28 (range 21- 35 days).  A subset (up to 
120) of participants ages [ADDRESS_635378] a blood draw at Day 7 (range 6- 9 days). 
 The amount of blood to be drawn at each timepoint is noted in the Table.  Table. Specimens to be collected  for [ADDRESS_635379]. John Alcorn’s lab  at the Rangos  Research Building will process all blood specimens  
for storage and handling following standard protocols  by [CONTACT_3665] .  Specimens  
will be shipped to CDC and CDC’s chosen laboratory contractors as well as to other 
contracted laboratories for proc essing and analysis.   
Flow cytometry results from CDC will be shared with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_493781].  
B. [ADDRESS_635380] historical strains will be conducted by [CONTACT_493801]’s chosen contractors.  
B. 3.1 Hemagglutination Inhibition Antibody and Microneturalization Testing  
Serum specimens will be tested by [CONTACT_493802]  (HAI) to estimate 
antibody titer response against the vaccine strains.  H AI testing will be conducted at 
CDC or by a CDC- designated laboratory. Miconeutralization titers may be  conducted by 
[CONTACT_493803](s ).  Serum antibody levels may be measured by [CONTACT_493804].  
B. 3.2 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC s)  
PBMC will be analyzed at the CDC laboratory for cell mediated immunity. Briefly, innate 
immune subsets (NK cells, innate lymphoid cells, gamma/delta T cells), antigen-specific 
B cell plasmablasts, HA-specific memory B cells, phenotypic (subsets) and functional 
(cytokine production) characterization of CD4 and CD8 T cells will be done using multi -
parametric flow cytometry.  For the proposed flowcytometric analysis 20x10
6  PBMC  
with greater than 85- 90% viability are required. In addition,  analysis of the changes in 
the B cell repertoire along with Ig-seq with LC/MS  in response to prior vaccination status 
and/or vaccine types will be considered for a subset of vaccinees.  For LC/MS , 1.[ADDRESS_635381] recently adapted our flow cytometry panels to take advantage of the Cytek 
Aurora platform capabilities here at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. This approach utilizes deconvolution of fluorescence data to allow for resolution of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_493782]. Our current panel for human PBMC is the following 26 antigens: CCR7, CD19, 
CD16, TCRγδ, CD14, CD8, PD1, CD56, CD4, CD28, CD11c, CD45Ra, CD3, CD25, 
[ADDRESS_635382], KLRG1, CD45R0, 
CD154. With this panel we can identify granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte subsets with high resolution. For example, this panel allows for identification of CD8+ T cells, 
NKT cells, CD4+ T cells, B ce lls. NK cells, and lineage negative ILC, further segregated 
by [CONTACT_493805]. All of this information is derived from a single flow 
cytometry run on 5x10
6 cells.    
 
Data are analyzed by [CONTACT_493806] t -stoichastic nei ghborhood 
embedding (tSNE) or sequential pattern discovery using equivalence classes (SPADE) 
to cluster cell types based on the full panel of antigens stained rather than typi[INVESTIGATOR_493783]. tSNE works by [CONTACT_493807] a probability  distribution that 
dictates the relationships between various neighboring data points in high- dimensional 
space. It then tries to recreate  a low dimensional space (two dimensional plot) that 
follows that probability distribution as best as possible to segregate cells based on similarity of marker expression. SPADE uses a similar approach to determine 
relationships between individual cells, but relays this information as a two dimensional 
branching tree plot that indicates the degree of similarity between cells. These algorithms allow for identification in three dimensions of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_493784], with the 
potential to identify new cell subsets.  
C. Statistical Analysis 
Pre- and post - vaccination geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) will be log
2 
transformed and compared among participants who received LAIV or ccIIV . The mean 
fold rise, seroconversion and serop ositivity  at Day 28 will be calculated.   
Seroconversion will be defined as either a pre -vaccination H AI titer <1:[ADDRESS_635383] -
vaccination H AI titer ≥1:40 or a pre -vaccination H AI titer ≥1:[ADDRESS_635384] with alpha set at 0.05  reveals the 
following:  
https://www.anzmtg.org/stats/PowerCalculator/PowerChiSquare  
 
If funding is available for the full sample, analyses based on prior 2019- 20 vaccine 
history (none, egg- based, cell -based) will provide additional insight into vaccine 
immunogenicity . 
 
D. Human Subjects  
D.1.  Consent  
 
Participants in this study will provide written consent  (parents and young adults)  and 
assent  (children/teens)  as applicable for specimen collection, influenza vaccination, and 
medical record review.   
Further details regarding data privacy and protection of human subjects are provided in 
the IRB application document.  
D.2.  Participant Compensation  
Participants will be c ompensated for each visit:  
• First visit =    $3 5 plus $5 travel for a total of $4 0  
• Second visi t on subse t =  $25 plus $5 travel for a total of $30  
• Final  visit =    $45 plus $5 travel for a total of $[ADDRESS_635385] size; unlikely to 
occur 
0.[ADDRESS_635386] size; assumes 10% failure to complete 
0.[ADDRESS_635387] size  
14 
 
14 
 The maximum possible payment will be  $90 (two visits) -$120 (three visits) .  If a 
separate vaccine visit is required, participants will be paid $30 for the blood draw and 
enrollment visit and $10 for a separate vaccine visit.   
D.3. Threats to study and contingencies  
In the event of a late start, some aspects of recruitment may be impacted: (1) PBMCs are time -consuming to process, leading to a limited throughput; thus, the sample size 
for PBMCs is constrained by [CONTACT_493808].  (2) vaccination in the community is likely to start early, due to vaccination by [CONTACT_493809]; later recruitment is more difficult because some will have already  been 
vaccinated.  
Contingency plans:  In the event of a late start, several contingencies will be used.  
First, a greater emphasis will be given to recruiting young adults, who are less likely to 
have been vaccinated early.  Second, if one vaccine is delayed, then persons may be 
recruited per the randomization scheme and those randomized to the missing vaccine 
may have their baseline blood drawn but be asked to return for the rest of the study 
once the vaccine is available.   Third, given that quality processing of the PBMCs is time 
consuming with limited throughput, overall target sample sizes may be reduced.

We are conducting a research study with people of age 4 to 21 years who are receiving a flu 
vaccine from their doctor to help us understand how people respond to flu vaccine, also called influenza vaccine, and to better understand the body’s protective response against flu.  We will ask up to [ADDRESS_635394] medical care and is highly recommended by [CONTACT_493810] 6 months of age and older. The flu vaccine will be one 
of two available licensed vaccines selected randomly, which is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin to decide which 
vaccine will be given.  The two vaccines randomly assigned are: 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] M OD19040242-017    Effective: 9/3/2020    Expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]: 4/14/[ADDRESS_635395] quadrivalent vaccine was approved by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA) in 2010.
2. Flucelvax quadrivalent flu vaccine given as a shot.  Flucelvax flu vaccine is licensed for 
use in patients [ADDRESS_635396] and store blood at 
2 visits as indicated below.  For 9-21 year-olds, approximately 2 tablespoons (36 mL) of blood will be drawn at each study visit for a total amount of blood equal to approximately 5 tablespoons (72 
mL).  The optional 1-week visit involves drawing 2 tablespoons of blood (24 mL) for a total amount 
of blood equal to approximately 7 tablespoons (108 mL) for three visits.  We may schedule an additional blood draw if not enough blood was collected at a previous visit, typi[INVESTIGATOR_493787] [ADDRESS_635397] only 2 teaspoons (10 mL) drawn at each of two study visits (enrollment and 1 month) for a total amount of blood of 4 teaspoons (20 mL).
All samples will have all personal identifiers removed, a research code applied, and may be tested 
for genomic and transcriptomics (e.g., messages that the body sends in response to vaccine which instructs the immune system on how to respond), and proteomic interactions (e.g. how the body fights infection) and may be used in other research tests to help us better understand immune response.  These blood samples will be stored and banked for an indefinite time under the supervision of [CONTACT_493829], one of the Co-investigators, a CDC designated lab and/or at their contractor laboratories and provided to other contracted laboratories for testing.
The study schedule is outlined in the table below:
Day of study What
Enrollment Blood work, survey, $30 payment
Vaccine visitVaccine will be given at enrollment or 
at a separate visit, $10 payment 
Visit 2 (6-9 days) after flu vaccine visit (Optional for ages 9-21 years only)Blood work, $30 payment
Visit 3 (21-35 days) after flu vaccine visit Blood work, $50 payment
Visit 4 (6-16 months) after flu vaccine visitAdditional visit if funded,  and if you are interested in continuing 
For those children ages 4-8 years who require 2 doses of vaccine, the second vaccine visit will include a payment of $10 and the timing of the blood draws would be as follows: Day [ADDRESS_635398] vaccine dose and Day 28 after second vaccine dose.   
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] M OD19040242-017    Effective: 9/3/2020    Expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]: 4/14/[ADDRESS_635399], current and future (until August 2021) information 
from medical records on [ADDRESS_635400] of, or in addition to, some of the exams needed for this study. This authorization is valid for an indefinite period of time. The following information may be collected: height, weight, medical problem lists, medications, vaccination history, and diagnosis codes.  This information will be collected by [CONTACT_493811]. Zimmerman and it will also be given a unique research code before names are removed. 
This identifiable medical record information will be made available to members of the research 
team for an indefinite period of time.
You can always withdraw your authorization to allow the research team to review your medical 
records by [CONTACT_493812].  If you do so, you will no longer be permitted to participate in this study.  Any information obtained from you up that point will continue to be used by [CONTACT_5051].
Data and samples without patient names will be shared with the multicenter research team 
including the CDC and their chosen lab contractors.  Any information that could identify you or your child will be removed before being sent out.
This information may be used by [CONTACT_493813], and/or for 
any retrospective research studies.  We will keep this information for an indefinite period of time, to be used for research studies related to influenza and response to vaccination.  
How will the privacy of medical record information be protected? 
Only [CONTACT_191515], the co-investigators, the research team, and clinical staff providing the flu vaccine will be aware of your or your child’s participation in this study. We will not link names to any of the information we release.  This information will be identified by a code number, and the information linking these numbers with you or your child’s identity will be kept separately.  You or your child’s identity will not be revealed in any description or publications.  Although we will do everything in our power to protect your or your child’s privacy and the confidentiality of these records, just as with the use of medical information for healthcare purposes, we cannot guarantee the privacy of research records.  
De-identified research data and blood will be placed in a database called the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) and may be shared with investigators conducting other research; this information will be linked by [CONTACT_493814].  
These research data/samples may contribute to a new discovery or treatment. In some instances, 
these discoveries or treatments may be of commercial value and may be sold, patented, or licensed by [CONTACT_493815][INVESTIGATOR_493788].  You or your child will not retain any property rights nor will you or your child share in any money that the investigators, the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], or their agents may realize.
Authorized representatives from the study sponsor, federal regulatory agencies, and the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_493789]’s identifiable information for the purpose of monitoring the conduct of this study.    To confirm vaccination status, state and federal immunization records will be checked.  In unusual cases, these research

document, but cannot guarantee the confidentiality of your research records, including information obtained from your medical records, once your personal information is disclosed to others outside UPMC or the University.
There is the possibility that you or your child may be eligible for other research studies 
independent of this one.  You may be contact[CONTACT_493816]/your child’s interest in other studies, but there is never under any obligation to participate.
Potential Risks of the Survey:  The risks associated with this study include the potential for a 
breach of confidentiality.  To reduce the risk of that happening, we will protect the confidentiality of this information.  You or your child may also feel some discomfort or embarrassment discussing personal matters.  You or your child may stop answering questions at any time.  We will also inform you if we learn of any new significant study risks associated with this research.
Although every reasonable effort has been taken, confidentiality during Internet communication 
activities cannot be guaranteed and it is possible that additional information beyond that collected for research purposes may be captured and used by [CONTACT_370703].
Risks of the Vaccine :  Flucelvax may commonly cause pain, bruising, or redness at the site of 
injection.  FluMist may commonly cause runny nose or nasal congestion.  Both Flucelvax and 
FluMist may less commonly cause headache, tiredness or crankiness, muscle aches, loss of appetite or overall feeling unwell.  Rarely, Flucelvax and FluMist may case a fever or a severe allergic reaction.  Participants who receive FluMist should avoid contact [CONTACT_493817] 7 days following vaccination to avoid possibly infecting them with the flu virus.
Risks of the Blood Tests:  Bruising, soreness, or rarely, excessive bleeding, infection, or 
scarring may occur as a result of the needle sticks to obtain blood.
If you believe that the research procedures have resulted in an injury to you or your child, 
immediately contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_493790].  Emergency medical treatment for injuries solely and directly related to participation in this research study will be provided by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_132121].  Your insurance provider may be billed for the costs of this emergency treatment, but none of those costs will be charged directly to you.  If your research-related injury requires medical care beyond this emergency treatment, you will be responsible for the costs of this follow-up care.  At this time there is no plan for any additional financial compensation. You do not, however, waive any legal rights by [CONTACT_3368]. 
Research Use of Genetic Information:  The risks associated with gene studies include the 
potential for a breach of confidentiality which could affect future insurability, employability, or reproduction plans, or have a negative impact on family relationships and/or result in paternity suits or stigmatization.
A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it 
illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This law will protect you in the following ways: 
• Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information 
that we get from this research. 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] M OD19040242-017    Effective: 9/3/2020    Expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]: 4/14/202 1                                                                          Page 6 of 8                                          • Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information that 
we get from this research when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums. • Employers with [ADDRESS_635402] genetic discrimination by [CONTACT_493818].
The data, samples, and genetic data generated from samples may be shared with other 
researchers and with federal repositories, in a de-identified manner (without identifiers).
You or your child will benefit from participating in this research by [CONTACT_493819].  Your insurance may be billed for the clinical staff to administer the 
vaccine.  The information we obtain may help us better understand how immune system responses to flu vaccines differ in and  how well flu vaccines work to prevent flu.  
Compensation for this study will go to you or your child as the 4- through 21-year-old 
participant whose name, address, and social security number will be released to the Accounting Office at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109].  All compensation is taxable income to the 
participant regardless of the amount.  If a participant receives $600 or more in a calendar year from one organization, that organization is required by [CONTACT_493820] a Form 1099 – Miscellaneous with the IRS and provide a copy to the taxpayer. Individuals who do not provide a social security number may still participate in the research, but the IRS requires that 28% of the payment be sent by [CONTACT_493821] ‘backup withholding’; thus you would only receive 72% of the expected payment.
Participation in this research study is completely voluntary.  If you or your child do not agree 
to participate in this research study, this decision will have no effect on you or your child’s current 
or future relationship with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], UPMC or its affiliated healthcare providers or healthcare insurance providers.  You or your child can still receive flu vaccine from your doctor’s office, even if you or your child/teen does not agree to participate in this study.  You or your child may be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_493822]-up blood draw visits, if not enough blood is able to be collected, or if you or your child develops a new health condition that arises that prevents future participation. 
If you choose not to participate in this study, you can choose to receive an influenza vaccination 
from your physician’s office or local pharmacy through your medical insurance plan.If you decide you no longer wish for you or your child  to participate after you have signed 
the consent form, you should contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zimmerman or his research team at ([PHONE_10269] .  
A decision to withdraw from this study will have no effect on you or your child’s current or future 
relationship with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_493791].  If you or your child withdraw (or are withdrawn) from this study, the data and blood samples collected before the date of withdrawal may still be used and shared with other researchers and CDC.

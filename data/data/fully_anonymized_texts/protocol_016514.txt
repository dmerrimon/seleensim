SPECIFIC AIMS 
Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis being tested.  
Specific Aims: 
Determine the reliability, validity, sensitivity/specificity and administration 
time of the CRSR -FAST in the acute care setting.  
Hypotheses: 
Hypothesis 1: Concurrent validity between CRSR -FAST and CRS -R total 
scores will be adequate.  
Hypothesis 2: Inter- rater reliabili ty of CRSR -FAST -derived diagnostic 
ratings (conscious v. unconscious) will be adequate. 
Hypothesis 3: Test- retest reliability of CRSR -FAST -derived diagnostic 
ratings (conscious v. unconscious) will be adequate.  Hypothesis 4: Internal consistency between  the CRSR
-FAST  total score 
and the four subscale scores will be adequate.  
Hypothesis 5: The sensitivity of the CRSR -FAST  in detecting features of 
MCS (using the CRS -R as a reference standard) will be adequate.   
Partners Human Subjects Research Appl ication Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, 2005  2 Hypothesis 6: The average administration t ime for the  CRSR -FAST  when 
administered in the acute care setting will be ≤ 10 minutes.  
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
The CRS-R1 is a standardized and validated bedside assessment of conscious 
awareness. It is used routinely for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with 
disorders of consciousness (DOC) as well as in research settings. One 
limitation of the CRS-R is the lengthy administrati on time required to obtain 
a total score. Administration time can vary from approximately 1 5-30 
minutes, depending on the patient’s level of responsiveness. For this reason, the CRS-R is rarely administered in the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Less time-
consuming scales and metrics are used to assess conscious awareness in the 
acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ICU setting, but they lack specificity and sensitivity and have 
not been validated, increasing the potential for misdiagnosis
2. In conjunction 
with the developers of the Neuroscore (an unpublished, abbreviated version 
of the CRS-R3), we have developed the CRSR -FAST  and aim to test its 
validity, inter- and intra- rater reliability. We anticipate that, compared with 
the CRS-R, the CRSR -FAST  will be less time-consuming to administer and 
score, but will maintain a high level of sensitivity to detecting signs of 
consciousness in severely brain injured patients. 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enro lled 
by [CONTACT_17839]-wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited  to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
Study design: prospective, cross-sectional study 
Participants: 75 subjects 
Inclusion Criteria: 
• Age 18 or older
• Fluent in English
• Surrogate available to provide informed consent
• History of severe acquired brain injury
• Sustained a TBI (defined by [CONTACT_606304]),
• Be within 3 weeks of injury
• Have a total GCS score <[ADDRESS_803161] ication Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, 2005  3 • Be unable to follow simple commands consistently at the time of
enrollment
Exclusion Criteria: 
•History of developmental, neurologic, or major psychiatric disorder
resulting in ongoing functional disability up to the time of the current
injury
•Physician orders for comfort measure s only
The following clinical factors will necessitate deferral of enrollment until the condition or symptom has resolved: •Evidence of a reversible medical condition or symptom that is judgedto be a safety concern or threat to the validity of the assessment, as
deemed by [CONTACT_606305].  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
Neurobehavioral Assessment 
Patients will be assessed using the CRS-R and the CRSR -FAST. The CRS-R is 
a standardized neurobehavioral rating scale that consists of 23 items 
organized into six subscales that address arousal, auditory, visual, motor, 
oromotor/verbal, and communication systems. Each subscale is organized 
hierarchically, with lower items representing reflexive behaviors and higher items indicative of cognitively-mediated behaviors. Reliability and validity have been demonstrated in multiple studies
1. The CRSR -FAST  consists of 10 
items organized into 4 subscales that address arousal, visual, motor and verbal/oromotor systems. Each subscale is organized hierarchically, with lower items representing reflexive behaviors and higher items indica tive of 
cognitively-mediated behaviors.  
An independent member of the study team (i.e., not an examiner ) will 
screen patients at MGH for eligibility through a medical chart review. When a 
patient meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria is identified, the study PI a nd 
study coordinator will be notified. The study coordinator will work with the 
patient’s clinical team to determine an appropriate time to approach the family for consent. Consent may be conducted remotely or in-person at 
MGH.  Once consent is obtained, the coordinator will work with the family and 
clinical team to determine an appropriate time to conduct the 
CRSR -FAST 
and CRS-R assessment(s). The study will conclude when a sample size of 
approximately [ADDRESS_803162] ication Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, 2005  4 The study will be conducted a cross approximately 4 sessions completed over 
one or two consecutive days and will be carried out by [CONTACT_606306] (A, B, and C). For example: 
Examiner A will administer the standard CRS-R and examiners B and C will 
administer the CRSR -FAST. This will enable calculation of concurrent validity 
(CRS-R v. CRSR -FAST) as well as inter-rater reliability of the CRSR -FAST  
(CRSR -FAST  Rater A v. CRSR -FAST  Rater B). Examiner C will administer the 
CRSR -FAST twice over a short interval to enable calculation of intra-rater 
reliability ( CRSR -FAST  Rater C at Time [ADDRESS_803163]  Rater C at Time 2) .  
Examiners may include Yelena Bodien, Joseph Giacino, a dedicated TBI 
Model Systems research assistant, postdoctoral fellow, and a surgical 
intensive care unit  Fellow.  
The test administration order will be pseudo-randomized to prevent order 
effects and each test administration will be timed.  
We will record concomitant medications, dosages and administration times. 
Sharing Results with Surrogates and Clinicians 
After discussion of the ethical implications of sharing or not sharing the CRS-
R and CRSR-FAST with ICU clinicians, family member participants on the TBI 
Model System Advisory Board, and members of the investigator team with 
the patient’s family and/or clinical team, we have developed the following 
approach: -To avoid exposing families to multiple sources of information (i.e.,
information coming from the clinical team and the research team regarding
level of consciousness,) we will not share the CRS -R or the CRSR -FAST data
directly with families.
-Upon request, we will make the results of the full version of CRS-R available
to the clinical team-We will provide an option on the consent form allowing the family to opt-out
of sharing data with the clinical team
-We will not provide the results of the CRSR-FAST to the clinical teambecause this is not a validated assessment and the reliability of detectingconsciousness is unknown.
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
This study does not include treatment or diagnosis.

improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
To ensure the safety of study subjects, the attending physician will provide 
medical authorization for participation in the study and  identify any potential 
contraindications. Study procedures will be terminated if  there is evidence of 
extensive distress or discomfort. 
FORE SEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
There are no anticipated medical risks associated with the neurobehavioral 
examinations that will be conducted with the CRSR -FAST  and CRS-R.  
CRS-R and  CRSR -FAST  exams sometimes include brief application of noxious 
stimulation to assess motor responses in the absence of command-following. Discomfort typi[INVESTIGATOR_606300] [ADDRESS_803165] and/or speak with the clinical staff 
to identify any implanted catheters or devices to avoid stimulation at these sites. The examiner will also ensure that there is no local tissue damage at 
the site of stimulation.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_803166] confidential information and securing both files in locked cabinet files and/or password protected electronic files. Surrogates will be informed that the Partners Institutional Review Board (IRB) may inspect identifying records and, therefore, absolute confidentiality cannot be assured.  		EXPECTED BENEFITS Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, improved safety, or technological advances.  This study is not designed to be of direct benefit to the subjects. Results may aid diagnostic and prognostic assessment of DOC patients and may provide ICU clinicians with an efficient, reliable and validate tool for assessing conscious awareness. The minimal risks associated with this study are reasonable relative to the anticipated results.   EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research. The subjects are expected to be ethnically diverse and include participants of both genders.   When people who do not speak English are excluded from participation in the research, provide the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak English should not be denied participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to translate the consent form in different languages and to have an interpreter present. Non-English speakers are excluded from the study because the CRSR-FAST is currently available only in English.   For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:           Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, 2005    7       http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/nonengco.htm    RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_17843].  Include any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment of women and minorities. An independent member of the study team (i.e., not an examiner) will screen patients at MGH (Lunder 6, Ellison 4 and Blake 12) for eligibility through a medical chart review. When a patient meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria is identified, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_606301]. The study coordinator will work with the patient’s clinical team to determine an appropriate time to approach the family for consent. Once consent is obtained, the coordinator will work with the family and clinical team to determine an appropriate time to conduct the CRSR-FAST and CRS-R assessment(s).   Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out-of-pocket expenses related to study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such expenses when funding is available There will be no cost to subjects for participation in this study. Subjects will not be paid for participation.  For guidance, refer to the following Partners policies:           Recruitment of Research Subjects      http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/recruit.htm           Guidelines for Advertisements for Recruiting Subjects     http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/advert.htm           Remuneration for Research Subjects     http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/remun.htm  CONSENT PROCEDURES Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent (i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_803167] obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.All consent meetings for patients will be conducted either remotely (via telephone or Enterprise Zoom) or at MGH and will be conducted by [CONTACT_606307]. Remote consent procedures will comply with the MGB IRB guidance (https://partnershealthcare.sharepoint.com/sites/phrmApply/aieipa/irb/Documents/Policy%20on%20Conduct%20of%20Human%20Research%20Activities%20During%20COVID-19%20Operations.pdf and https://www.partners.org/Assets/Documents/Medical-Research/Clinical-Research/Informed-Consent-of-Research-Subjects.pdf). Specifically, when verbal consent procedures are used, subjects will be provided with a copy of  the written informed consent document, fully informed about the study and given the opportunity to have all questions answered. Study staff will adhere to the relevant sections of the remote visit guidelines provided by [CONTACT_606308] (i.e., the Clinical Research Virtual Visit Checklist). A script will be used to obtain surrogate consent and document the verbal consent. All email communications with surrogates will comply with the MGB IRB guidelines (https://www.partners.org/Assets/Documents/Medical-Research/Clinical-Research/FAQs-Email-Communication-with-Research-Participans-and-Potential-Research-Participants.pdf).     Consent will be obtained from the patient’s surrogate decision-maker as all subjects will, by [CONTACT_108], lack capacity. Surrogates approached about participation in the study will be clearly informed that participation is voluntary, that a decision not to participate will not jeopardize clinical care or participation in rehabilitation, and that study participation can be discontinued at any time during the study. If a surrogate withdraws from the study, they may request that the data be discarded. After discussing the terms of participation, procedures, and potential outcomes with the surrogate, consent will be obtained by a member of the research team.  No time limit will be placed on the surrogates to consider participation, though only patients within 3 weeks of injury will be enrolled.  The attending physician and nurse will be notified once the patient has been enrolled.   NOTE: When subjects are unable to give consent due to age (minors) or impaired decision-making capacity, complete the forms for Research Involving Children as Subjects of Research and/or Research Involving Individuals with Impaired Decision-making Capacity, available on the New Submissions page on the PHRC website: http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/newapp.htm#Newapp For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:           Informed Consent of Research Subjects     http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/infcons.htm

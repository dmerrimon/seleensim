Protocol date: 11/12/2021  1.0. Background & Significance 
Young women treated for childhood cancer with chest radiotherapy (RT) have a very high risk of breast 
canc er. By [CONTACT_654] 50, almost one in three women treated with chest radiotherapy (RT) for a childhood cancer will 
be diagnosed with breast cancer.[ADDRESS_1174829] among Hodgkin lymphoma survivors, with a cumulative 
incidence of 35% by [CONTACT_654] 50. For perspective, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer, by [CONTACT_654] 50, among 
BRCA1 carriers is 31%; among women in the general U.S. population, it is < 5%.[ADDRESS_1174830] cancer among childhood cancer survivors is highly 
dependent upon stage of disease at diagnosis. In two systematic reviews,2,3 we reported that the clinical 
characteristics of tumors (e.g., hormone status, location) in women treated with chest RT were similar to those 
among women with sporadic breast cancer. When detected at a node negative early stage, breast cancer in this high-risk population is highly curable. There are two very important therapeutic limitations in treating 
women for breast cancer following chest RT for a childhood cancer. First, using breast irradiation for local  
control of disease is rarely used due to the risk of radiation-induced tissue and fat necrosis in these women 
who have already been treated with high dose radiation to the breast. Second, for women with node-positive 
breast cancer, therapy for the childhood cancer limits the options for adjuvant therapy for secondary breast 
cancer.
2-[ADDRESS_1174831] cancer -spec ific mortality is 19%; the 10-year all -cause mortality after a diagnosis of breast 
cancer is 32%.[ADDRESS_1174832] MRI is recommended by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group (COG),
2,19 the American Cancer Society (ACS),13,20 the International Guideline 
Harmonization Group,3 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),21,[ADDRESS_1174833] cancer surveillance is inadequate for this high-risk population. In a survey of female 
childhood cancer survivors living in North America, we found that only 55% of women who were treated with 
chest RT and were aged 25-50 years reported a mammogram in the previous two years; <3% reported a breast MRI.
24 Further, 47.3% of women under age 40 had never had a surveillance mammogram. Only 52.6% 
of women aged 40-50 were being regularly screened (2 mammograms within 4 years) –  a proportion similar to 
two average -risk populations.24 Of note, mammography was more common among the high-risk women who 
reported a physician recommendation than those who did not (ages 25-39 years, 76.0% vs 17.6%; ages 40- 50 
years, 87.3% vs 58.3%). Lack  of awareness of risk was also a key barrier.24-[ADDRESS_1174834] adult survivors of 
childhood cancer are disconnected from the cancer center and are followed by [CONTACT_18674] y care providers (PCPs).  
 Established in 1994 the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is the largest longitudinal cohort of 
childhood cancer survivors worldwide.

Protocol date: 11/12/2021  one of 31 institutions in North America are participating. Based on data from the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_690398] (SEER), the CCSS cohort was found to be representative of the larger U.S. population of 
childhood cancer survivors.[ADDRESS_1174835] reported that over 80%, regardless of risk level, are no longer followed at their treating institution while 88% have a PCP or another usual source of care.
29-[ADDRESS_1174836] a Survivorship Care Plan (SCP).29,[ADDRESS_1174837] play an important role in their long-term health care, (especially since PCPs may not be familiar with their health care risks), encouraging activation is both necessary and important. The 2003
43 and 200544 
Institute of Medicine reports highlighted the suboptimal care of cancer survivors in the U.S., with the latter report being subtitled, ‘Lost in Transition’. These seminal reports recognized the critical need for improving the 
health care of cancer survivors, particularly those at high risk for late effects and second cancers. A barrier in 
the transition process is the poor two-way communication (verbal, written, electronic) between cancer 
specialists and PCPs.
43,[ADDRESS_1174838] communication and 
individualized and timely information,45-48 particularly in the management of high-risk cancer survivors.35-37 ,49,50  
The goal of PCP activation is to: (1) increase provider knowledge about the importance of early detection of breast cancer for childhood cancer survivors, and specifically for their patient; and (2) motivate providers to 
educate and screen survivors. The combination of patient and PCP activation for breast canc er surveillance in 
this high-risk cohort may yield the best outcomes. 
 
For the past [ADDRESS_1174839] (1) characterized the magnitude of breast cancer 
risk,
1,51 and risk of other serious chronic conditions;51-53 (2) identified factors that modify their breast cancer 
risk;1,54-56 (3) led in the development and dissemination of national and international guidelines for breast 
cancer surv eillance;2,3,21,22 (4) documented the very low rates of surveillance among these women;24,57 and (5) 
identified the barriers and facilitators to completing a mammogram and/or breast MRI.24-26 These efforts led to 
the EMPOWER -I Study (R01-CA134722), which was a 2- arm, ra ndomized controlled trial among women aged 
25-[ADDRESS_1174840] the efficacy of targeted mailed materials fol lowed by a telephone- delivered brief motivational 
interview, on mammogram (primary outcome) and breast MRI (secondary outcome) surveillance rates 
compared with an attention control. We hypothesized that women in the intervention group would have a 20% 
higher rate of surveillance mammography than women in the control group. At the 1-year follow -up, 39.8% of 
women in the intervention group completed a surveil lance mammogram compared with 19.6% of those in the 
control group. The intervention group was 2-times more likely than the control group to have a surveillance mammogram (adjusted RR=2.0; 95% CI 1.6-3.4; p=0.013). However, overall uptake for breast MRI was  low 
and there was not a significant difference between groups (intervention: 18.7%, control: 16.4%). Key barriers 
identified for not obtaining an MRI and / or mammogram were: ‘doctor didn’t order it’, ‘put it off’, ‘cost’, and 
‘haven’t had any problems’. Importantly, among the women in the intervention group who did not complete an 
EMPOWER- II 
5 
Protocol date: 11/12/2021  MRI, 86.7% reported that their PCP did not recommend this surveillance test. Following completion of the 
study, we partnered with Right Action for Women (RAW), a national philanthropic program that provides financial assistance for high-risk women who need a surveillance breast MRI. Based upon our efforts, RAW 
now provides assistance for an annual low cost breast MRI to all women in the U.S. who are in this risk group 
and whose income is below the 400% Federal Poverty Level. 
 
In summary, women who were treated with chest RT for a childhood cancer are at increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_845407] a young age. Early detection of breast cancer in this population is associated with 
improved survival and other long-term outcomes. Interventions provide the opportunity to reduce cancer -
related morbidity and mortality. To accomplish this, survivors must be knowledgeable about cancer -related 
health risks, recommended health screening procedures, and other risk -reducing interventions. The proposed 
study will provide the opportunity to evaluate the impact of theoretically -based intervention aimed at increasing 
awareness of risk and breast cancer surveillance options and facilitating women in obtaining a breast MRI and 
mammogram. Knowledge derived from this research will inform future intervention studies not only among 
female, but also male survivors at risk for other late effects.  Based upon our findings and with input from our 
Patient and PCP Advisory Boards, we propose the EMPOWER -II study, with a primary goal of increasing the 
rate of women completing the recommended combination of breast MRI and mammogram. Extending from the 
core component of the EMPOWER -I intervention (targeted mailed educational materials) we will evaluate the 
utility of patient activation with and without added PCP activation. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1174841] release, we anticipate that surveillance 
guidelines and recommendations sent from the CCSS directly to the PCP (PCP activation) will prompt 
discussions between providers and patients and result in further boosting the surveillance rates. Thus, we wil l 
determine the incremental increase in surveillance rates by [CONTACT_845427]. In addition, we will explore moderating and mediating patient- and provider -level factors that predict breast MRI 
and mammography completion and timing of the obtained surveillance; and estimate the replication costs of 
the interventions and costs resulting from the interventions.  
As a supplement, we will also establish a breast imaging repository by [CONTACT_845428] -I (completed study) and 
EMPOWER -II Studies. We hypothesize that the proportion of females treated for a childhood cancer with chest 
radiotherapy will be more likely to have heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breast tissue than women without a history of cancer. We will then evaluate mammographic breast density, background parenchymal 
enhancement on breast MRI, and other potential radiomic biomarkers. 
As current circumstances created by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_1174842] hindered participants’ ability to safely 
partake in screening practices, two additional objectives have been added to obtain additional information from participants available to us during this time. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_845429] a voluntary survey containing brief qualitative questions regarding the ways in which COVID -[ADDRESS_1174843] 
impacted the participant’s life and their ability to receive care during and after this time.  Questions will also pertain to participant insurance coverage and the impact of coverage on screening behaviors. There are no hypotheses related to these inquiries, as the questions are simply exploratory in nature.   2.1 Objectives 
Primary objective: To determine the effectiveness of: (1) a smartphone-based Patient Activation (PA) 
intervention and (2) PCP activation added to patient activation (PA+PCP), compared to control (C) participants receiving the EMPOWER -I intervention targeted mailed materials, on completing a breast MRI and 
mammogram .

rates of breast cancer surveillance (breast MRI and mammogram) than women in the C group. 
 
Given the primary focus of the trial on non-economic endpoints (and sample size requirements associated with 
these endpoints), we will not conduct formal hypothesis tests on the economic outco mes.  
 
3.0 Participant Recruitment and Enrollment 
We will enroll 320 women from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), alternatively known as the 
Long-Term Follow -Up Study (LTFU) to participants. The CCSS is a multi -institutional, multi -disciplinary 
collaborative research resource established to systematically evaluate long-term outcomes among children 
EMPOWER- II

Protocol date: 11/12/2021  diagnosed with cancer who survived five or more years from diagnosis. Participants will be recruited in three 
waves (97/wave) by [CONTACT_845430], which has extensive experience recruiting for our studies.  
We anticipate enrolling [ADDRESS_1174850] regarding participation in this study.  
An introductory letter of invitation will be sent via e-mail by [CONTACT_845430]. Included in this 
e-mail will be (1) an invitation to join the EMPOWER -II study; (2) instructions on how to download the Eureka 
platform and (3) a brief summary of study activities.  A second letter will be sent to non-responders via regular mail. After [ADDRESS_1174851] been randomized in the study. With over 1,400 women in the CCSS potentially eligible for 
this study and the high participation rate in EMPOWER -I, we do not anticipate a problem in enrolling 320 
participants.  During the study enrollment, there will be an estimated 1,456 women who fulfill the eligibility 
criteria.  
 
All participating survivors will be compensated $50 for each survey completed at baseline and at the end of 
the study  ($100 total for each survivor). We will also compensate PCPs for their time in answering the short 
survey at baseline and at the end of the study. We will compensate at the same rate as the survivor participants: $50 per survey ($100 total for each PCP).  
 
At Duke:  
We will administer surveys (print at baseline and end-of-study ) for the PCPs of the CCSS participants in 
order to collect information on PCP factors. Primary care providers will be given an information sheet with a 
written summary about the research including: (1) purpose of the research; (2) time involved; (3) assessment 
of minimal risk; (4) statement regarding benefit to participants; (5) contact [CONTACT_845431]; 
and (6) contact [CONTACT_845432] a research participant. Their completion of the brief study surveys 
will serve as implied consent and they will not be separately consented for participation, as we believe this would serve as a barrier. The cover letter will be written as to indicate that the completion and return of study surveys implies consent to participate in EMPOWER -II. 
 
Supplemental Imaging 
There will be no additional recruitment/enrollment for the supplemental study. It involves collecting and 
analyzing data on women who enrolled in EMPOWER -I and EMPOWER -II Studies and completed a breast 
imaging study as part of clinical care. Imaging studies will only be obtained for women who participated in 
EMPOWER -I and EMPOWER -II and signed a HIPPA authorization and medical release form .  
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Eligible participants will include women who:  
 3.1.1 Participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS);  
3.1.2 Were diagnosed with a childhood cancer prior to the age of 21 years;  
3.1.3 Were treated with ≥ 10 Gy of ches t RT (recent revision with a lower dose threshold);
[ADDRESS_1174852] cancer;    
3.1.[ADDRESS_1174853] MRI and mammogram in the previous 24 months; 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1174854] a contraindication to MRI (i.e., pacemaker);  
3.1.7  Are 25 years of age or older at time of enrollment; 
EMPOWER- II

Protocol date: 11/12/[ADDRESS_1174855] 8 years; 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1174856]  a smartphone; 
3.1.10 Are English -speaking.  
 
3.2 Randomization and Stratification 
After completion of the baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned, in a ratio of 1:1:1, to 
one of the three groups (control, PA, PA+PCP). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_845433] 
(25-39, ≥40), by [CONTACT_520447] (Hodgkin lymphoma, other cancers), and by [CONTACT_399958] a previous breast 
imaging exam (either mammogram or breast MRI) in the previous 24 months (yes, no). Because we did not 
observe a difference in mammography or breast MRI surveillance between white, non-Hispanic and minority 
survivors in EMPOWER -I, we will not stratify by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity. However, we will oversample from minorities in 
CCSS with the goal of having 18% of participants in the tri al coming from minority populations. Further, since 
only a small percent of participants had a family history of breast cancer (<1%) or did not have a PCP (8%), we 
will not stratify by [CONTACT_845434]. However, we will have tailored push notifications  / video vignettes for 
women without a PCP that are intended to help them find one. These three stratification factors were chosen 
because of the desire to maintain balance between the three arms with respect to age, cancer diagnosis, and recent single imaging study while simultaneously keepi[INVESTIGATOR_845408] a minimum and ensuring 
stratum size does not get too small.
[ADDRESS_1174857] their continued participation in other aspects of the CCSS. The purpose of the study and potential risks 
and benefits will be explai ned during the informed consent process. All data gathered will be kept in a secured 
location and available only to members of the research study team. The key elements of the informed consent procedure which will be explained to participants are: (1) the research status of the study; (2) the potential risk 
and the provisions for it; (3) the lack of guarantee of benefit from participation; (4) the voluntary nature of the 
study; (5) the lack of consequence to medical care of the decision to consent or refuse to participate; and (6) 
the freedom to withdraw from the study or to refuse to answer specific questions or to participate in any aspect of the study at any time.  
 4.0 Design and Procedures 
This is a phase III, 18 -month, 3-arm randomized controlled trial . Extending from the core component of the 
EMPOWER -I intervention (targeted mailed educational materials) we will evaluate the utility of patient 
activation with and without added PCP activation. Data will be collected at baseline and approximately 18-
months through patient and provider surveys and medical record review. The primary outcome will be a self -
reported breast MRI and mammogram.  
The baseline and end- of-study surveys will be self-administered through the Eureka app. Non-compliant 
participants wil l be given an option to complete the surveys online through a link sent via email and push 
notification. A follow -up push notification and email will be sent for non-responders. If the participants are 
unable to complete the app or online surveys after automated and email reminders, the CCSS Coordinating 
Center will administer the questionnaires over the phone. A print option via regular mail, followed by a phone 
call from the study team, will be sent as a final attempt to collect survey data. The questions  pertaining to 
socio -demographics, general health status, health care access, and health and cancer screening practices are 
standard CCSS items. Considering potential technical issues as well as the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic, 
follow -up of end-of-study data may take a few months to allow patients to return completed surveys and 
qualitative interviews.

Protocol date: 11/12/[ADDRESS_1174858] study outcomes (mammogram, breast MRI, breast ultrasound, medical records 
and pathology) from [ADDRESS_1174859] the approximated 18-month study 
window will be done via 2 regular mailings, an email notification (sent by [CONTACT_845435]), and a follow -up 
phone call from the CCSS Coordinating Center who will administer the questionnaires over the phone. The 
mailed packet will include 2 options to complete the end-of-study survey: a) a full survey set or b) an abbreviated version of the survey focusing on the main study outcomes (i.e. were they able to get their breast cancer screening tests done and wher e). PCP factors will also be collected for this group. This attempt extends 
this group’s  participation by [CONTACT_8622] a year. These participants have already completed the baseline survey but 
have not responded to multiple automated and email reminders within the initial 18-month study period. This extended timeline will not be applicable to those who are currently active in the study.  
 To collect information on PCP factors, the Duke team will administer the baseline and end-of-study  surveys 
(print via fax) for the PCPs of the CCSS participants. We will ask women in the baseline survey for the name 
[CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_845436]’t 
have one at baseline.  
 
After completion of the baseline measurement questionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned, in a 
ratio of 1:1:1, to one of the three groups: control, patient activation (PA), or patient activation + primary care provider activation (PA+PCP). An overview of the [ADDRESS_1174860] sharing survey and a Eureka App user experience survey will be added to the End of 
Study Questionnaire.  
 
This study will use a 3-group comparative effectiveness design comparing: 
• Targeted mailed educational materials (C)  including a Survivorship Care Plan; 
• C + patient activation (PA) consisting of (1) a HIPAA compliant smartphone app that will be used to administer surveys and provide electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_845409]; and (2) tailored  
push notifications and app messages with links to video vignettes discussing the primary barriers to breast 
MRI and mammography identified by [CONTACT_845437] -I; 
• C + PA + PCP activation (PA+PCP) with physician materials about breast cancer risk in this population 
along with national and international guidelines for breast cancer surveillance.  
 
Specific intervention components are explained in greater detail in Appendix II. During the developmental 
stages for this study, our Patient and PCP Advisory Boards provided recommendations for the interventions and study materials. A summary of their feedback can be found in Appendix III.  COVID -19 Response 
 Study outcomes may be affected by [CONTACT_845438]/or health insurance of study participants due to 
the COVID -19 pandemic. In light of this, the study period for participants who consented or who received a 
study invitation prior to the COVID recruitment hold will be extended to 18 months. These participants will 
receive their end-of-study survey through the Eureka app once they complete their screening tests 
(mammogram a nd/or breast MRI) or at approximately [ADDRESS_1174861] imaging exams (standard clinical process for receiving outside radiologic 
imaging exams) of women enrolled in EMPOWER - I and EMPOWER -II. The data (demographics, cancer type, 
date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, treatment information) from the CCSS and EMPOWER Studies will be used to annotate the repository. The quality of all imaging studies added to the repository will be evaluated. A 
deep-learning segmentation method will be applied to optimize comparability between imaging studies.

Findings will be compared to a non-cancer population of women who have screening mammograms at Duke. The EMPOWER survivors will be matched 1:3 to the non-cancer population, matched for age at study(within 2 years), calendar year of mammogram, race/ethnicity (white, non-Hispanic; African American, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; other), and menopausal 
status (pre- menopausal, post-menopausal).  
 
A BPE (minimal, mild, moderate, marked), will be assigned to each MRI reviewed. BPE will also be 
measured by a fully automated computer algorithm developed by [CONTACT_845439]. Findings w ill 
be compared to a non-cancer high-risk population of women who have screening breast MRIs at Duke (current repository with 900+ MRIs). The EMPOWER survivors will be matched 1:2 to the non-cancer population, 
matched for age at study, calendar year of mammogram, race/ethnicity, and menopausal status.  
 
The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium’s publicly available data on breast density will be used to 
confirm our findings in cases where the quality of images may be inadequate or when there is an inadequat e 
number of non-cancer controls for the matching.  
5.0 Data Collection: 
 The data collection planned for this study will be obtained from the Eureka app, mail, and telephone-
based self-report questionnaires and medical record report (breast MRI and/or mammogram reports). 
 
Supplemental Imaging 
Duke’s source of research material will be a limited data set placed in a breast imaging repository. The 
data will have encrypted identifiers and will be used specifically for research purposes. 
 The Duke EMPOWER Breast Imaging Repository will create a custom data collection and management 
system which collects information on patient demographics, medical history, breast imaging results, and 
pathology outcomes.  
 
5.1 Primary and Secondary Outcomes:  
The following items  were developed in ‘Mammography and High-Risk Survivors of Pediatric Cancer’ (R21 
CA106972; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_845410])
24-26 and refined for EMPOWER -I (R01CA134722). 
• Breast MRI practices: Items that characterize breast MRI practices, including a differentiation between 
screening and diagnostic breast MRI and barriers to having an MRI.  
• M ammogram practices: Items that characterize mammogram practices, including a differentiati on 
between screening and diagnostic mammography and barriers to having a mammogram.  
• A scertainment of the primary and secondary breast cancer surveillance outcomes: The primary 
outcome will be a self-reported breast MRI and mammogram. If a survivor reports that she has had a breast MRI and/or a mammogram, she will be asked the contact [CONTACT_845440]. We 
will then contact [CONTACT_845441], provide the signed medical record release form (from enrollment), and request a faxed copy of the imaging report(s).  
• D
escriptive data on physician visits, abnormal imaging studies, biopsies and cancers: In the end-of -
study  survey, participants will be asked to describe all medical visits during the study period, including 
routine non-procedure breast-related visits. Women who have had a mammogram and a breast MRI or ultrasound will be asked if they had an abnormal imaging study and the follow -up procedures for this 
imaging study. As per CCSS standards, if a woman reports a breast cancer, we will seek copi[INVESTIGATOR_845411].

Protocol date: 11/12/2021  5.2 Mediating and Moderating Variables:  
Items designated with an asterisk were developed in the ‘Mammography and High-Risk Survivors of 
Pediatric Cancer’24-26  and refined for the EMPOWER-I Study. In EMPOWER -II, we will also include measures 
of patient activation and self-efficacy. 
• Patient Activation Measure (PAM): measures patient activation and includes: believing one has an 
active role to play, having the confidence and knowledge to take action, taking action, and staying the 
course under stress.59  
• Knowledge of breast cancer surveillance recommendations: determines the level of knowledge 
regarding the recommendations for breast cancer surveillance and the benefits and other considerations of screening. 
• Ba
rrier sc ales: elicits a rank order of the most relevant and important barriers of breast MRI and those

 5.3 PCP Variables:  
We will administer a baseline and end-of-study  survey of the PCPs of women in EMPOWER -II. For this 
survey, we have modified a survey that we assisted [CONTACT_845462] in developi[INVESTIGATOR_845413] (K07CA134935; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_845414]; Co-Mentor: Oeffinger).
35,36 Items within the survey 
include:  
• Demographics: age, gender, years in practice, practice setting 
• Past experience and comfort level: number of adult survivors of childhood cancer seen in last five years 
(categorical), frequency of receiving an SCP (categorical), comfort level with caring for survivors of three cancer types (Likert scale), and familiarity with available guidelines (Likert scale).  
• K
nowledge: Using a hypothetical vignette of a [ADDRESS_1174865] 
cancer, and cardiac dysfunction.  
 
5.4 Economic Measurements:   
In the proposed study, we will capture information regarding the replication costs of the intervention and 
health services resulting from the intervention. For the replication costs, the dollar amount will be determined 
per participant, for the materials, postage, PopS ockets, and notifications/app messaging/mobile data use will 
EMPOWER- II 
12 
Protocol date: 11/12/2021  be determined per participant. To determine the health services resulting from the intervention, we will survey 
participants at the end-of-study  measurement regarding their use of specific health care services (routine or 
acute medical visit unrelated to breast cancer screening, non-procedure breast-related medical visit). We will 
collect a copy of all breast imaging studies from the imaging facility. In addition, women reporting a breast 
biopsy or breast surgery will be asked to provide the contact [CONTACT_845442]/medical facility so that 
we can obtain a copy of all breast surgical procedures. This strategy has been successfully employed in other 
CCSS studies, including EMPOWER -I. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1174866]  Phone Survey:  
 
After  completion of the end of study  survey,  participants  in the PA and PA+PCP groups  will be contact[CONTACT_845443] a voluntary  brief phone survey  that will cover topi[INVESTIGATOR_845415], COVID-19, and how these issues  may have impacted their engagement in the 
EMPOWER  intervention. All participation will be voluntary  and participants  will not receive  additional  
compensation if they choose to participate in this additional  study  component.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1174867] (fax) confirmation of the self- reported imaging studies. We were 
successful in obtaining the proper reports for 85.7% of the participants. However, for the remaining 14.3%, we were unable to confirm the study due to lack of information provided by [CONTACT_845444], the imaging facility being unable to locate records and the facility sending only partial information, despi[INVESTIGATOR_845416]. Importantly, the findings were not substantively different when we 
repeated the analysis including only women with a fax -confirmed imaging study. Stratifying on the 
randomization strata, differences in these proportions will be estimated with stratum -adjusted proportions 
calculated using the weighted average of the stratum -specific differences and accounting for the sampling 
scheme. The Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test
[ADDRESS_1174868] for differences between (1) PA and C, and 
(2) PA+PCP and C in an intent-to-treat analysis where women who do not complete the end-of-study  
assessment will be counted as not having had a breast MRI and mammogram. We will also perform a 
secondary analysis of women with a fax -confirmed imaging study.  Based on EMPOWER [ADDRESS_1174869] results to differ based on race/ethnicity, but will verify this result here. The analytic methods for the 
secondary objectives will be the same as for the primary objective, using the Cochran-Manetel -Haenszel test 
to examine differences between the interventions (PA, PA+PCP) on breast cancer surveillance rates (breast 
MRI + mammogram) and on rates of each individual surveillance test. 
 
To explore moderating factors  that m ay be associated with obtaining a breast MRI and a mammogram, we 
will use mixed effects models. The mixed model is ( )i i i i i e b Z X Y+ = , , ,α µ where for participant i , Yi is the 
response vector capturing whether the participant had a breast MRI and mammogram, X i is a fixed effects 
design matrix that includes indicators for treatment group, randomization strata, assessment time (baseline 
and end-of-study ), potential confounders, and moderator variables, Z i is a design matrix for the random effects 
that would allow random subject deviations from the population average response, α contains the fixed effects 
regression coefficients, b i contains the random effects coefficients, e i is the vector of error terms, and b i and ei 
are normally distributed with means of zero. We will test whether variables significantly moderate having a 
breast MRI or mammogram by [CONTACT_845445]. Further, by [CONTACT_845446], we will test whether the effectiveness of the intervention differs by [CONTACT_845447].  
 
EMPOWER- II 
13 
Protocol date: 11/12/2021  To explore mediating factors, we will follow MacKinnon and colleagues’ recommendations and examine 
potential factors in  a post-hoc manner and make necessary adjustments.[ADDRESS_1174870] per person. This will 
include the dollar costs of the materials, personnel time for creating the cancer treatment summaries, PopSockets, mailings, and notifications/app messaging/mobile data costs. From this data, we will estimate a 
dollar cost and time cost per person. This will not include the costs for developi[INVESTIGATOR_845417], as our goal is to determine the dissemination cost per person. Upon completion of the study, we will have developed several “deliverables” that can be disseminated for use by [CONTACT_127761]. These will include the cancer treatment summary template, harms and benefits of cancer surveillance information, and patient and physician education handouts. These materials will be made publicly available on the CCSS website: http://www.stjude.org/ccss.  
 
We will identify utilization of screening and diagnostic imaging (breast MRI, mammography, and 
ultrasound), diagnostic procedures (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], core needle biopsy and excisional biopsy), breast surgery, and non-procedure breast -related physician visits. Each service will be multiplied by a unit cost 
amount in order to estimate total costs. We will use Medicare’s [ADDRESS_1174871] Practice Expense and Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) to estimate average unit costs for physician and laboratory services. 
Although most study partic ipants will not be Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare’s reimbursement methodology 
was developed to reflect true resource costs.
[ADDRESS_1174872] estimates will not include the costs of events that follow diagnosis (e.g., costs of breast cancer treatment). As previously mentioned, we will not conduct formal hypothesis tests  on the economic outcomes given the 
primary focus of the trial on non-economic endpoints (and sample size requirements associated with these endpoints). Resource utilization and cost data are typi[INVESTIGATOR_244216], and therefore the sample size of the trial will likely be insufficient to detect significant differences in costs between study arms.

assessment by [CONTACT_845448] (<40, 40+ years), menopausal status at the time of the mammogram (pre-menopausal, post-menopausal), age at childhood cancer diagnosis (<10, 10-
20), and time from childhood cancer diagnosis (<15, 15-24, 25+ years).  
 The clinical review categories will be dichotomized to BI-RADS 1 and 2 (fatty replaced, scattered areas of 
fibroglandular tissue) vs BI-RADS  3 and 4 (heterogeneously dense, extremely dense). Our primary outcome 
EMPOWER- II

Protocol date: 11/12/[ADDRESS_1174875], 
Wilcoxon rank -sum, and Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. A chi -square test will be used to test for differences 
in the proportion of BPE measurements between the survivor and non-cancer control groups with the BPE recorded as an ordinal variable. The BPE will also be dichotomized into nominal variables using threshold BPE values (i.e., minimal vs valid, moderate, or marked). Receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to 
determine the optimal BPE threshold to maximize both sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing the survivors 
from the non-cancer controls. A logistic regression will be used to calculate OR and 95% confidence intervals.  
We will also use the fully automated algorithm to compare the eight BPE continuous measures between 
the two populations. For the comparisons, we will construct adjusted linear regression models. We will be underpowered for the comparisons but will be able to generate the necessary preliminary data in order to 
design future studies and comparisons. 
 
6.1 Missing Data 
Every effort will be made to minimize missing data and participant drop -out, both among the women and 
their PCPs. The primary analysis is an intent-to- treat analysis and will include all women who are randomized 
to the study regardless of whether they complete the end-of -study  assessment (participants who drop out will 
be counted as failures in this analysis). Secondary analyses will include exploratory comparisons restricted to 
women who complete the end-of-study  assessment. If potential moderating and mediating factors are missing, 
we will use multiple imputation.

To inform our power calculations, we used densiy measures reported on the outside radiology reports for 
women in EMPOWER-I and then used three different proportions of BI-RADS ¾ density: 0.60, 0.65, 0.70. We 
then used the age-appropriate breast density proportions reported by [CONTACT_845449] (http://tools.bcsc -scc.org/dataexplorer/) as shown in Table 2. We will use a 1:3 matched non-
cancer population for comparison.

Appendix II: Intervention Components 
Control (C) Group:  
The control group will only receive the print materials. We will use the core component of the EMPOWER -I 
intervention. Targeted print materials will be sent to women in all three groups (C, PA, PA+PCP) by [ADDRESS_1174882] to a PopSocket and added an information sheet to find a PCP (if the participant 
does not have one). In addition, the information on low cost mammograms and breast MRI will include a link to 
the MRI Assistance Program (http://www.rightactionforwomen.org/assistance/) and the information on low cost 
mammography that was used in EMPOWER -I. All women enrolled in EMPOWER-II who meet the financial 
criteria for assistance (income below 400% National Poverty Level) will be eligible for assistance. For purposes of the non-profit status of RAW, women need to submit either the previous year’s tax return or, if applicable, a 
copy of a Medicaid letter. Once these steps are completed, the participant’s PCP can then order a breast MRI that is scheduled by [CONTACT_845452] U.S. This step is not necessary in 
Canada, where a PCP can order a breast MRI for this high-risk population and have it covered by [CONTACT_22241].  
Patient Activation (PA) Group:  
Building upon the core intervention components used in EMPOWER -I (i.e., print educational materials), we 
will evaluate the utility of patient activation through use of automated, highly tailored and interactive push 
notifications, supplemented by [CONTACT_845453] 90-second video vignettes and mapped to the behaviors being 
encouraged, and a survivorship-specific smartphone app (Eureka app). The push notifications are built to work 
in concert with the Eureka app and do not require the app to be open to receive push notifications. Opening the 
push notifications will trigger study -related activities within the Eureka app. We will use the Eureka mHealth 
Research Platform for sending push notifications, brief surveys for updating information, video vignettes, and 
study activity reminders. The mHealth Research Platform Resource is a mobilized cohort and infrastructure to 
carry out clinical research studies using mobile and digital technology developed by [CONTACT_59923], 
San Francisco (UCSF). The goal of the Resource is to provide an infrastructure for efficient data collection, 
storage, and sharing that can be configured to support internet- or mobile phone app-based research studies. 
Eureka supports data collection for consenting participants on behalf of IRB -approved research studies, stores 
that data on secure cloud-based servers, and provides access to that data to platform users (including 
EMPOWER- II 
18 
Protocol date: 11/12/2021  participants and study teams) with a granular password protected user permissions system. The Eureka 
Privacy Policy and Data Security Measures agreement document has been uploaded into the eIRB. This is the 
IRB-approved policy all participants will have to agree to as part of the app registration process.  
Our goal is to develop an inexpensive set of automated tailored notifications, video vignettes, and materials 
that do not rely on personnel time and thus can more easily be disseminated. The overarching goal of this 
approach is to activate the participant to make an appointment with her PCP and to discuss, request, and 
obtain breast cancer screening. We have also incorporated a reminder strategy in the push notifications and 
app messages.  
The push notifications, app messages, and video vignettes are based upon an algorithm that is highly 
tailored in content (e.g., history of prior screening, specific barriers, etc.) and tim ing (e.g., will be informed by 
[CONTACT_845454]-making mapped to the behaviors being encouraged) and will ask specific questions (e.g., 
do you have a PCP, have you had a breast MRI and/or mammogram in the last [ADDRESS_1174883] an appointment with PCP and when). The information sent via the Eureka 
app will be tailored to participants’ answers. The number of push notifications and app messages that a participant receives will be variable, will occur at least monthly until screening is completed (based upon their  
responses), and will include:

methods, transforming primary care, and dealing with busy primary  care practices. Importantly, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_845421] a handful of adult survivors of childhood cancer in their practice, each with a different cancer, 
treated with different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845422]. Thus, the challenge is to get the right information to the right 
person at the right time. When the participant in the PA+PCP group responds to an above automated app 
message indicating that she has scheduled an appointment and has provided a name [CONTACT_845461], the following information will be sent to the PCP’s office manager by [CONTACT_845455]:  
• Template cover letter with the patient’s name, notation of previous history of chest RT, and 
recommendation for breast MRI and mammography and contact [CONTACT_845456];  
• Executive summary – breast cancer in childhood cancer survivors treated with chest RT and current 
breast cancer surveillance recommendations (with links to citations for those who want additional information); 
• FAQ (one-page) discussing common questions, such as “why both a breast MRI and a mammogram 
are recommended”, “my patient has dense breast tissue”, “what about radiation exposure from mammograms”, 
and “cost of imaging”; 
• Template of letter for insurance company if needed for pre -authorization of a breast MRI with the key 
words for insurance carriers and the appropriate ICD -10 codes.

       Appendix III: Recommendations from our Patient and PCP Advisory Boards  
During the development stage for EMPOWER -II, we held conference calls with our diverse Patient Advisory 
Board  that consists of six childhood cancer survivors, four of whom participated in the EMPOWER -I study. 
Their invaluable feedback included:  
• Enthusiasm about the use of text messages - would be ‘less likely to be lost in the shuffle of papers’  
• Include a text reminder 1-[ADDRESS_1174884] 
cancer screening with their primary care provider  
• Importance of the involvement of their PCP, including the ability to share their SCP with him/her, ‘so they take us seriously and know that screening is important and needed’  
• Highlight the need for obtaining both a breast MRI and mammogram  
• Tailor the message to reflect the diversity of the participants  
• Make sure to include a video vignette about ‘how to talk to your doctor’ about screening 
In the pre-study phase, prior to study enrollment, we will finalize our push notifications, app messages, and video vignettes, with the assistance of our Patient Advisory Board.  
In preparing this protocol, we held conference calls with our PCP Advisory Board that consists of six 
physicians – two general internists, two family physicians, and two obstetrician-gynecologists. We selected 
physicians of women who participated in EMPOWER -I as well  as community -based and academic physicians 
who attended the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the

Protocol date: 11/12/2021  American College of Physicians co-sponsored “Cancer Survivorship Symposium: Advancing Care and 
Research, A Primary Care and Oncology Collaboration” in January 2016. Recommendations included: 
• Mail the information to the office practice manager  and ask him/her to ‘flag this information’ and bring it 
to the attention of the PCP. This will help avoid ‘getting lost in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_5829]’.  
• R emember the 7 second rule – get to the ‘ask’ in the first 7 seconds of reading. 
• Remind PCPs how their patient will benefit from the communication.  
• Include a pre-addressed fax page with three questions for the PCP: (1) Is this information new to you; 
(2) Will you discuss breast cancer screening with your patient; and (3) If the patient desires, will you 
order a breast MRI?  
We will finalize our PCP materials with the assistance of our PCP Advisory Board prior to study enrollment.

Protocol date: 11/12/2021  Appendix IV: Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
To ensure the safety and data integrity of the project, we plan to request that the NIH funding institution 
appoint a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) . Duke Cancer Institute / Duke University does not have 
a standing external DSMB and thus, in accordance with NCI guidelines, we will work with our program officer 
to develop a DSMB to monitor this phase III study (https://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/grantspolicies/datasafety.pdf ). 
  We will be prepared to suggest potential members of the DSMB who would be fully independent of Duke 
University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845423], cancer screening, behavioral interventions, and clinical trials statistical analysis. However, we expect that final decisions on membership will be made by [CONTACT_138768]. We anticipate that members will be appointed during the study set-up phase. This will enable the DSMB 
to review the Manual of Operating Procedures - which the investigative team will have developed, including the 
research protocol, informed consent documents, and safety and quality control monitoring plan - before 
initiation of the study, and for the DSMB to develop an explicit set of expectations and guidelines based on NIH requirements and considerations which will be followed for all the monitored period.  
 The DSMB will be responsible for assuring that subjects are not exposed to unnecessary or unreasonable 
risks and that the investigators conduct the clinical trial according to the highest scientific and ethical standards. Ongoing responsibilities of the DSMB will include:  
• Reviewing routine reports prepared by [CONTACT_845457], with emphasis on data integrity and 
patient safety issues, including: reports on adverse events to the NIH Project Officer, recommendations to the Project Officer concerning continuation or termination of the trial, protection of the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring, ensuring adequate protection of human subjects and addressing 
ethical concerns based on Federal Guidelines;  
• Reviewing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - SAE reports will be sent to the DSMB within 48 hours; the 
DSMB will then propose an action plan to be sent to the PIs and the funding institution;  
• Evaluating the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, 
participant recruitment, accrual  and retention, participant risk versus benefit ratio, and other factors that can 
affect study outcome;  
• Considering the impact of factors external to the study when new information, such as scientific or therapeutic developments, become available and may affect the safety of participants, their willingness to participate in the study, or the conduct of the trial;  
• Reviewing study performance, making recommendations and assisting in the resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_7676];  
• Protecting the safety and privacy of study participants;  
• Reporting on the safety and scientific progress of the trial;  
• Making recommendations to the funding institution concerning continuation, termination, or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
• Ensuring data integrity;  
• Ensuring confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring;  
• Assisting the funding institution by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, sample size, statistics, and/or data collection; and  
• Reviewing and evaluating requests for protocol modifications after the trial begins and advise the funding institution as to whether the study should continue as approved or undergo a protocol modification.  
 
We anticipate very few adverse events for this study. In EMPOWER -I, we had no adverse events. Events 
that are not expected given the nature of the research procedures and the subject population being studied, and that suggest that the research places subjects or  others at greater risk of harm or discomfort related to the 
research than was previously know or recognized, will be reported to the Duke IRB as an unanticipated 
problem. Harm to a subject need not occur for an event to be an unanticipated problem. All study staff at Duke 
University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845424]- II 
25 
Protocol date: 11/12/[ADDRESS_1174885], who will report them to the IRB as soon as possible and within the following 
time frames: 1) report any death and potentially life-threateni ng events within 3 days of notification of the event,  
2) report any serious/unexpected adverse events associated with the study within 3 working days, 3) all other 
adverse events will be reported within 15 calendar days, 4) discuss any event that does not meet the above 
requirements with the study team and report yearly to the Duke IRB. These data will be reported to the DSMB 
for independent assessment. 
  
Given the minimal risk nature of the interventions, the modest size of the study sample (N=320), and the 
fact that the project does not use an investigational medication or device, we expect that members of the 
DSMB will be able to participate in meetings via teleconference. After the first meeting, we anticipate that the 
DSMB will meet approximately biannually at set intervals until recruitment is complete. Additional meetings 
may be necessary, depending on problems encountered or any special circumstances. The DSMB will be 
provided with a report that will contain safety data summaries for each data collection center, patient 
demographics and compliance data, recruitment, visit schedules, missed visits, outcomes and Medical Event 
Forms and any other adverse events. The DSMB will be able to request specific information and analyses from 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_845425]. A final meeting will be held shortly after completion 
of the study.

Page 8PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale
Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infa nts, adolescents, and 
young adults. In particular, N meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) is responsible for 
approximatel y two -thirds of the cases of observed meningococcal infections in Europe, with 
a case -fatality  rate of 6% to 8% from [ADDRESS_171907] of meningococcal cases seen in North America.
A recombinant, multicomponent MnB vaccine (Bexsero) is licensed in the European Union 
(EU), Canada, Australia, and Chile; and recommendations for use are under considera tion in 
various countries. Trumenba®(bivalent recombinant lipoprotein 2086 vaccine), developed 
by [CONTACT_4618], has recently  (October 2014) been approved in the [LOCATION_002] for active 
immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by N meningitidis serogroup B, for use in 
individuals 10 through 25 y ears of age .The US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Advisory  Committee on I mmunization Practices (ACI P) has assigned a 
Category  B recommendation for administration of MnB vaccines for adolescents and young 
adults aged 16 to 23 years, with particular focus on the 16- to18-year age group. A 
Category A recommendation was assigned for M nB vaccin ation of
certain groups of persons 
at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease, including for persons aged 
[ADDRESS_171908] diverse MnB strains is anticipated to provide 
substantial improvement in prevention of this uncommon but severe bacte rial infection and a 
reduction in the burden of disease.
Trumenba is targeted to a conserved, surface -exposed lipoprotein, lipoprotein 2086 
(LP2086), a meningococcal virulence factor that binds human factor H, and therefore is 
designated as factor H binding protein (fHBP). The L P2086 gene is present in 100% of MnB 
strains in [COMPANY_007]’s strain collection of more than [ADDRESS_171909] subfamilies, A and B. Trumenba is a sterile 
suspension composed of 2 recombinant lipi[INVESTIGATOR_149319], 1 from fHBP 
subfamily  A and 1 from subfamily  B(A05 and B01, respectivel y).
This study  was initiated in September 2
012 to assess the longevity  of immune responses in 
adolescents (aged  10 to <19 years at the time of entry  into a primary  study) following 
receipt of a vaccination regimen of 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rL P2086 in a primary  study  
(a previousl y conducted Pfiz er study  using the final formulation of bivalent rL P2086). This 
study  was amended in January  2015 to add a booster dose of bivalent rL P2086 at 
approximatel y 4 years following the final dose of the 2
-or 3-dose primary  bivalent rL P2086
vaccination series. The study  was therefore divided into Stage 1 ( 4-year persistence of 
immune responses following receipt of a primary vaccination series) and the booster stage 
(follow -up through 12 months after booster vaccination).

dose) of bivalent rLP2086 or saline in the primary study  (ie, a previousl y conducted 
[COMPANY_007] study  using the final formulation and dose of bivalent rL P2086).
Booster Stage
To describe the immune response as measured b y hSBA titers to [ADDRESS_171912] vaccination with bivalent rL P2086 in the primary  study , 
before the booster vaccination, and 1 month ,12 months, and 26 months after a single 
booster dose of bivalent rLP2086.
Primary Safety Objective (Booster Stage)
To evaluate the safet y profile of bivalent rLP2086 as measured b y the incidence of local 
reactions, s ystemic events, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), newl y 
diagnose d chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs), medically  attended events, and 
immediate AEs following a booster vaccination of bivalent rL P2086.
Primary Endpoints
Stage 1
Proportion of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for each 
of the 4 primary  strains at each blood draw visit in Stage 1 (Visits 1
-6). 
Booster Stage
Proportions of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ LLOQ for each of the [ADDRESS_171913] vaccination received in the primary  study , before the 
booster vaccination (Visit 6), and 1 month, 12 months, and 26 months (Visits 8, 10,

Design
Stage 1 of the study  (Visits 1 -6) is designed to provide follow -up information on [COMPANY_007] 
Studies B1971010, B1971012, and B1971015, which used the final formulati on and dose of 
bivalent rL P2086 (primary  studies). In Stage 1, subjects will attend up to 6 study  visits for 
collection of a 20 -mL blood sample at each visit.
The booster stage of the study  (Visits 7
-11) is optional for eligible subjects at selected sites . 
Subjects who wish to participate in the booster stage must have completed Stage 1 and 
received all scheduled doses of bivalent rLP2086 in the primary  study . 
Subjects will be required to sign a consent form to enter and participate in the booster stage
for Visits 7 to 10. Eligible s ubjects at selected sites will be asked to sign another consent 
form prior to participating in Visit 11
,for a blood draw at 26 months after the booster 
vaccination. 
For consenting booster stage subjects, a booster dose of 1 20 µg of bivalent rL P2086 will be 
administered at Visit 7 and blood samples (20 mL per visit) will be collected for 
immunogenicity  anal ysis 1month , 12months, and 26 months after the booster vaccination 
(Visits 8, 10, and 11 ).

1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
The development program for the [COMPANY_007] investigational Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B 
(MnB) bivalent recombinant lipoprotein 2086 vaccine (bivalent rLP2086; subfamily A and 
B; Escherichia col i) is in support of licensure with an indication for active immunization to 
prevent invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by  [CONTACT_149333] y 
A or subfamil y B factor H binding protein (fHBP) in adolescents and young ad ults, aged 10 
through 25 y ears.
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Neisseria meningitidis Disease Background
N meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, adolescents, and y oung 
adults. I n particular, MnB is responsible for approximately  two-thirds of the cases of 
observed meningococcal infections in Europe, with a case -fatality  rate of 6
% to 8% from 
[ADDRESS_171932] quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4, 
MenACWY vaccine) in the [LOCATION_002] in 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory  Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) prioritized 
vaccination for persons aged [ADDRESS_171933], however, been as high as 134 per 100,000 
among undergraduates at Princeton University  during a 2013/2014 outbreak and 21.1 per 
100,000 among 17 -to 22 -year-olds at the University of [LOCATION_004] Santa Barbara during a 
2013 outbreak.9,10

Page 25Vaccine candidates aimed at producing antibodies to the capsular pol ysaccharide of 
serogroup B N meningitidis are unlikel y to be useful, because they are poorly immunogenic 
given the chemical similari ty between the serogroup B capsular pol ysaccharide and 
molecules found on human neuronal cells.11Vaccines produced from outer membrane 
vesicles (OMVs) prepared from MnB strains have been shown to have clinical efficacy  
against homologous strains but not a gainst heterologous strains.12,13A recombinant, 
multicomponent MnB vaccine (Bexsero) is licensed in the European Union (EU), Canada, 
Australia, and Chile, and recommendations for use are still under consideration in various 
countries.  Trumenba®(bivalent rLP2086), developed by  [CONTACT_4618], has recently  (October 2014) 
been approved in the [LOCATION_002] for use in individuals 10 through 25 y ears of age for 
active immunization to prevent IMD caused b y MnB. The US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s Advis ory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has assigned a 
Category  B recommendation for administration of MnB vaccines for adolescents and y oung 
adults aged 16 to 23 years, with particular focus on the 16- to18-year age group. A 
Category A recommenda tion was assigned for 
MnB vaccination of certain groups of persons 
at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease, including for persons aged [ADDRESS_171934] disease -associated meningococci.15Trumenba 
utilizes a conserved, surface -exposed lipoprotein, lipoprotein 2086 (L P2086), as a vaccine 
target.16In the meningococcus, L P2086 is a virulence factor that binds human factor H. The 
LP2086 gene is present in 100% of MnB strains in [COMPANY_007]’s strain collection of more than 
[ADDRESS_171935] subfamilies, A 
and B. Subfamily  B proteins are expressed in approximately  70% of isolates, and 
subfamily A proteins are expressed in approximately  30% of isolates. rLP2086 has been 
expressed in E coli and formulated in a bivalent vaccine composed of [ADDRESS_171936] an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_149320].18,19The in vivo complement -mediated bacterioly sis of MnB is mimicked by  [CONTACT_149334] n complement (hSBA), a functional serological 
assay  shown to be the correlate of protection against I MD20and recognized as the surrogate 
marker of vaccine efficacy .21,22,23

particular, 3 Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in adolescents (B1971010, B1971011, and 
B1971012) demonstrated that a substantial proportion of subjects exhibited potentially  
protective responses after [ADDRESS_171938] .
Complete information for this compound may  be found in the single reference safet y 
document (SRSD), which for this study  is the IB. The SRSD sfor the concomitant vaccines

1.2.5. Study Rationale
The purpose of Stage 1 of the study  is to assess the longevity  of immune responses following 
receipt of a vaccination course of 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rL P2086.
This study  was initiated in September 2012 to assess the longevity  ofimmune responses in 
adolescents (aged  10 to <19 years at the time of entry  into a primary  study) following 
receipt of a vaccination regimen of 2 or 3 doses 
of bivalent rL P2086 in a primary  study  (a 
previously  conducted [COMPANY_007] study  using the final formul ation of bivalent rLP2086 ).This 
study  was amended in January  2015 to add a booster dose of bivalent rL P2086 at 
approximatel y 4 years following the final dose of the 2
-or 3-dose primary  bivale nt rL P2086 
vaccination series.  The study  was,therefore ,divided into Stage 1 (
4-year persistence of 
immune responses following receipt of a primary vaccination series) and thebooster stage 
(follow -up through 12 months after booster vaccination). 
The study  is now amended to further evaluate safety  and immune respo
nses up to [ADDRESS_171939] that the 0-, 2-, and 
6-month andthe 0-and 6-month schedules are the dosing schedules approved by  [CONTACT_1622].

Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_171954] agree to use a highly effective method of 
contraception consistently and correctl y through Visit 10 of the study  (Month 12 after
booster vaccination ). Visit 11 (26 months after booster vaccination) is being added to the 
booster stage of this protocol amendment after subjects have completed Visit 10 .Therefore, 
the contracept ion requirements do not apply  to Visit11. 
The investigator or his/her designee
, in consultation with the subject, will select the most 
appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of 
contraception methods (see below) , and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use. 
Subjects need to affirm that they  meet at least one of the selected method s of contraception. 
The investigator or his/her designee , at each study  visit, willdiscuss with the subject the need 
to use highly  effective contraception consistentl y and correctly according to the schedule of 
activities 
and document such conversation i n the subject’s chart. In addition, the investigator 
will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected birth control method is 
discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception is
allowed provided th e subject plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire 
study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to 
ensure effectiveness.
Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD).
Male condom or female condom used WI TH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, or 
suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus spermicide 
is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option is not appropriate.
Male sterilizat ion with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy  ejaculate.
Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_149321]

Subjects participating in the booster stage will receive [ADDRESS_171956] administration details (ie, date of administration, kit number, volume, 
route, and site of administration) will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). 
Investigational p roduct accountability  will be documented as per Section 5.6.
In the event of a product quality  complaint, which is defined as a report regarding a phy sical, 
chemical, microbiologic, or other al leged defect of a [COMPANY_007] Vaccine Research investigational 
product, the investigator or designee will telephone the responsible person at [COMPANY_007] as 
detailed in the SRM and follow the instructions therein.
5.1.Allocation to Investigational Product
At enrollment into Stage 1 of the study , the site personnel registered the subjects into the 
study  via the use of an interactive voice response sy stem (IVRS) or interactive Web

response s ystem (IWRS). The purpose was to allocate a subject number and track subject
visits. 
At enrollment in the booster stage, allocation of open- label vaccine kits to subjects will 
proceed through the use of an IVRS, an IWRS, or an equivalent s ystem that is accessible 
24hours a day , 365 day s a year. The k it number should be obtained from the IVRS prior to 
vaccination. The site personnel (study  coordinator or specified designee) will be required to 
enter or select information that will include the user identification and password, the project 
and protocol number, the investigator sit e number, the fax number, the subject number, and 
the date of birth of the subject. The site personnel will then be provided with a subject 
number and kit number.

temperature -monitored refrigerator for storage. For storage, the preferred orientation of the 
vaccine is horizontal.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting ( for example, via a log), a
t a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations ( as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated ,and/or room -temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active daily  evaluation 
for excursions should be available .  The operation of the temperature -monitoring device and 
storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, sho uld be regularl y inspected to ensure 
it is maintained in working order.
The refrigerator must be locked and secure and have limited access. It is the responsibility  of 
the investigator(s) (or designee) to record dail y refrigerator temperature readings (wo rking 
days onl y), to maintain a daily  temperature log for the refrigerator, and to alert the sponsor of 
any deviations. Investigational product must be stored as indicated .
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined an d not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site. 
Any excursions from the product -label sto rage conditions should be reported upon discovery . 
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to storage conditions as

Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_171968]’s medical record).  In an y circumstance, e very effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, 
and follow -up with the subject regarding any  unresolved AEs.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no furthe r evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. 
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required t ests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator wil l take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.

7.1.1. Bivalent rLP2086 Serum Bactericidal Assay - Primary Test Strains
For assessment of the immune response to bivalent rLP2086, functional antibodies will be 
analyzed in hSBAs with MnB strains. The hSBA measures antibodies in human sera that initiate complement-dependent killing of the target meningococcal strain. Four (4) primary test strains,  (A22),  (A56),  (B24), and  (B44), will be used in the hSBAs for determination of the immunogenicity endpoints in sera obtained from all subjects at all study visits. The MnB hSBAs are validated before any testing is performed.
Sera obtained [ADDRESS_171970] vaccination with bivalent rLP2086 in the primary 
study will be reassayed concurrently with sera obtained during B1971033 study visits. 
Sera in subjects who did not receive bivalent rLP2086 in study B1971015 (Group 2) will also 
be assayed in amendment 3.

Page 60Medically  atten ded events and NDCMCs will be also assessed throughout the study  and 
documented on the appropriate AE CRF. A medically  attended event is defined as a 
nonserious AE that results in an evaluation at a medical facilit y.An NDCMC is defined as a 
disease or m edical condition, not previously  identified, that is expected to be persistent or 
otherwise long- lasting in its effects.
AEs (serious and nonserious), NDCMCs, and visits to other medical facilities will be 
assessed at stud y visits as specified in the AE re porting schedule ( Table 3) and reported as 
defined in Section 8. AE-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], visits to other medical facilities, 
medication use, and day s of school 
or work missed will be collected and recorded in the AE 
CRF. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149324], such as 
elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], healthcare visits for preventive care, or routine physical 
examinations, will not be collected. Non–AE -related concomitant medications and day s of 
school or work missed not associated with an AE will not be collected. A study  
visit/telephone contact [CONTACT_149343] a guide, completed at each scheduled 
study  visit/telephone contact, and included in the source documentation. Please refer to the 
SRM for details.
Subjects will be given a memory  aid at Visit 8. The memory  aid will be used to remind 
subjects to review with study  site personnel an y significant illnesses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124052], 
NDCMCs, or visits to a medical facility . Subjects may  use the memory  aid as needed during 
the safet y telephone call at Visit [ADDRESS_171976] in 
reporting and discussion of events with study  staff, but t hese memory  aids will not be 
considered source documents and will not be collected at study  visits. Only information 
collected b y stud y staff as part of the stud y visit or telephone call will be included in the 
source documents and entered into the CRF.
In addition, AEs and SAEs will be collected as defined in AE reporting schedule (
Table 3). 
For the purposes of this study , these are referred to as unsolicited AEs and will be recorded 
and reported as described in Section 8.
7.3.Pregnancy Testing
For 
female subjects of childbearing potential , a urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity  of at 
least 25 mIU/mL , will be performed immediately  before administration of the booster d ose. 
A negative pregnancy  test result is required before the subject may  receive investigational 
product.
Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated as per request of institutional review board s 
(IRBs) /ethics committees ( ECs) or if required b y local regulations .

Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_171977]’s parent(s)/legal guardian will be issued an e -diary , based on a 
personal digital assistant or equivalent technolog y, and used to monitor and record the 
subject’s local reactions, systemic events, and use of antipy retic medication for 7 days after 
vaccination. Grading scales for local reactions and sy stemic events are based on US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry , Toxicit y Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials.25The 
e-diary  allows recording of these assessments only  within a fixed time window, thus 
providing the accurate representation of the subject’s experience at that time. End dates of 
local reactions, sy stemic events, and use of antipyretic medication (associated with vaccine 
administration) that were ongoing on the last day  the e -diary  was completed will be collected 
on the CRF. The investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_7071](s)/legal guardian in order 
to obtain st op dates for any  e
-diary  events (such as local reactions and s ystemic events, 
including fever) ongoing on the last day  that the e -diary  was completed.
Data reported on the e- diary  will be transferred electronicall y to the e -diary  vendor (a trusted 
third pa rty), where they  will be available for review by  [CONTACT_149344] -based portal.  At intervals agreed upon between the vendor and [COMPANY_007], these data 
will be transferred electronically  into [COMPANY_007]'s database for anal ysis and reporti ng.  These data 
do not need to be reported by  [CONTACT_149345].
Investigators will be required to review the e -diary data online at frequent intervals to 
evaluate subject compliance and as part of the ongoing safet y review.
7.5.Local Reactions
Local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at injection site) at the site of the study  vaccine 
injection will be recorded daily  for 7 days (Day  1 to Day 7) after booster vaccination.
7.5.1. Injection Site Redness and Swelling
Redness and swelling will be measured an d recorded in caliper units (range: 1 to 21+), and 
then categorized as none, mild, moderate, or severe based on the scale given below.  Each 
caliper unit represents 0.[ADDRESS_171978] diameter of a local reaction.  In the event that a caliper measurement is between 2 
values, the higher value should be reported.  The measurements will then be recorded in the 
e-diary .
In the event the reaction exceeds the maximum size the caliper is able to measure (>21 
caliper units), the subject or subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian will also measure the 
maximum diameter of the redness and/or swelling at the injection si te using the measuring 
tape/ruler provided and report this immediately  to the investigator.  The subject or subject’s 
parent(s)/legal guardian will report the maximum diameter of the redness and/or swelling at 
the injection site to the investigator daily  until the reaction becomes  21 caliper units.  These 
measurements will be recorded in the CRF.

7.7.Risks and Benefits
Potential risks associated with participation in Stage 1 of this study  are limited to those 
associate d with drawing blood (bruising, mild bleeding, momentary discomfort, fainting, 
and, rarel y, infection), as well as an y potential long -term side effects (later -emerging events) 
that may  be related to bivalent rL P2086, administered previousl y in the primary studies. 
Refer to the most recent version of the bivalent rLP2086 I B for a summary  of the known 
risks and potential benefits of the vaccine to human subjects after primary  and booster 
vaccinations.
There may  be pain and/or bruising with blood collections or with vaccine injection.
Any newl y identified risks to the subjects must be reported promptly b y the sponsor to the 
investigators.

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_171981](s) will be reported as descr ibed in the following sections.
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative. For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y of the 
AE. The investigator is required to assess causality . Follow -up by  [CONTACT_36545] a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the spo nsor, an y nonserious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent for the booster stage, which is obt ained 
prior to the subject’s participation in the booster stage of the stud y, ie, prior to undergoing 
any booster stage study -
related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through 
and including Visit [ADDRESS_171982] after the active reporting period has ended should be 
reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs 
that the investigator believes have at lea st a reasonable possibility  of being related to the 
study  vaccine are to be reported to the sponsor.
NDCMCs identified from the time of the 6-month telephone call in the primary  study
through Visit [ADDRESS_171983]’s participation in the study .
At all visits, stop dates for an y reported AEs that were ongoing at the previous visit will be 
recorded in the CRF.  The investigator must instruct the subject or, where relevant, 
parent(s)/legal guardian on the need to report AEs and SAEs during this time period.

Page 65SAEs with an onset during Stage 1 (ie, prior to the booster s tage) will be reported under the 
primary  study  protocol (ie, the protocol the subject was enrolled in PRIOR to being enrolled 
in B1971033).  SAEs with an onset during the booster stage will be reported under Study 
B1971033. 
8.2.1. Stage [ADDRESS_171984] a reasonable possibility  of being related to 
study  vaccine are to be reported to the sponsor. 
AEs, including SAEs and suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), reported to the primary  study from which 
the subjects proceeded into this follow -on study (B971033, Stage 1) will be reported to 
regulatory  authorities in accordance with applicable local regulations.
At Visits 1- 6 (Stage 1), the site will inquire about any  RRIs ( Section 8.6) and nonserious AEs 
occurring during the [ADDRESS_171985] provides informed consent for the 
booster s tage to Visit 8, and then from Visit 8 until 48 hours after the Visit 8 blood draw and 
from Visit 10 and Visit 11 until 48 hours after each blood draw ,will be reported and 
recorded.
SAEs and nonserious AEs resulting in evaluation at a medical facility  (medically  attend ed 
events )are reportable from Visits [ADDRESS_171986] or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;

Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong vaccine, by [CONTACT_1148], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength . 
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate. In the event of medication d osing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including, but not limited to:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or 
do not involve the participating subject;
The administration of expi[INVESTIGATOR_149325];
The administration of an incorrect investigational product;
The administration of an incorrect dosage;

from the specified storage range, unless it is determined by [CONTACT_149346] r use.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or
Test result leads to a change in study dosing, discontinuation from the study , significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AE b y the investigator or s ponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any  of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Research -Related Injury
Should a subject in the first 48 hours following blood draw, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
suffer a medicall y important RRI  caused b y his or her participation in the study , [COMPANY_007] or its 
representative must be informed immediatel y.
A medicall y important RRI  is an y untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity ;
Results in congenital ano maly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an injury is an 
important medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  
life-threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it i s determined that the 
event may  jeopardize the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other

Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_171987] medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Result s in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Lack of efficacy  in an approved indication should be reported as an SAE.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm ; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Medical device complaints may  meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see section on 
Medical Device Complaint Reporting Requirements ).  An incident is any  malfunction (ie, the 
failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended; 
performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device) that, 
directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, or of 
other persons, or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.

Page 69A serious injury  that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:
a life-threatening illness, even if temporary  in nature;
a permanent impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to a body structure; 
a condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 2 bulleted 
items
Examples: clinically  relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure, a condition that 
requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149326];
any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in vitro diagnostic 
device test results when used within the manufacturer’s instructions for use;
fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects.
8.7.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be rep orted by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ).
8.7.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Liver function tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in this 
study .  However, should an investigator deem it necessary  to run LFTs because of clinical 
sign/sy mptom presentation in a subject, such L FT results should be handled and f ollowed up 
as described below.
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be consid
ered 
important medical events.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects wi th AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value [ADDRESS_171988] with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkal ine phosphatase value 2X ULN or not available;

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 20 -March -2017
Page 70For subjects with preexisting AL T OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
ULN, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned 
above:
For subjects with preexisting AST or AL T bas
eline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values  2times the baseline values and [ADDRESS_171989], or 
[ADDRESS_171990] (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with:
For subjects with preexisting values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level inc reased from baseline b y an amount of at least [ADDRESS_171991] or
if the value reaches ≥[ADDRESS_171992] (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_171993] bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline 
phosphatase. A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. 
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time, should be 
considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availa bility  of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy ’s 
law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.8.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) i n a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronar y care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];

Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_149327] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg, for 
workup of persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure requir ed by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.   These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure w as performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.9.
Severity Assessment
Table 10. Severity Assessment Grade
GRADE If required on the AE CRFs, the investigator will use the adjectives M ILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE. For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
[ADDRESS_171994]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_171995]'s usual function.

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_171996]'s usual function.
Note the dist inction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above .
8.10. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, a s appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product cau sed or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see 
thesection on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product ," 
this should be clearl y docume nted on study  records.
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and r eport such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.11. Exposure d uring Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and marketed products, an EDP occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be , pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product; 
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
[COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been 
exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during 
his partner’s pregnancy .

information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
and Exposure during Pregnancy  (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has 
occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product b
y inhalation or spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP 
supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and 
within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to term ination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and noti fy [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcom e of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_171998].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_093]. Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Inform ation Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.12. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when ,during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 20 -March -2017
Page 74An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unitwithin 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.13. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded o n the appropriate AE CRF 
page.
When a subject withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.14. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject/parent/legally  accept able representative.  I n addition, each study  
subject/parent/legall y acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs.
8.15. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited repor ting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.15.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_171999] be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure cases.
For subjects enrolled in the booster stage , if the investigator is aware of an SAE with an onset 
on the day  of investigational product administration or during the ca lendar day  following 
investigational product administration, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_149347] y immediately after sending the SAE Report Form to [COMPANY_007]. These 
procedures do not replace an y of the standard SAE reporting requi rements as described 
above. Additional information can be found in the SRM.
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_172000] awareness of the AE.

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 20 -March -2017
Page 75For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time fra mes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.15.2. Nonserious Adverse Event Reporting Requi rements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For exam ple, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_149348] y as soon as possible after 
becoming aware of an AE that required medical attention that began on the day of 
investigational product administration or during the calendar day  following investigational 
product administration.  These procedures do not replace an y of the standard AE reporting 
requirements as described in Section 8. Additional information can be found in the SRM.
8.15.3. Medical Device Complaint Reporting Requirements
All medical devi ce complaints regardless of whether the medical device complaint is 
associated with an AE will be collected on the applicable pages within the CRF.  This 
includes potential incidents or malfunctions associated with the use of a medical device 
product.  An incident or malfunction is an event that might have led to death or serious 
deterioration in health, or if it occurred again might have led to death or serious deterioration 
in health.
[COMPANY_007] is to be notified of all medical device complaints within 24 hou rs of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event.
8.15.4. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including S[LOCATION_003]Rs, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local 
regulations.

Page 769. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed meth odology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a statistical analy sis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the 
start of an y analyses and will be maintained by [CONTACT_456].  This document may mod ify the 
plans outlined in the protocol; however, an y major modifications of the primary endpoint 
definition and/or its analysis will be reflected both in the amended protocol and in the SAP.  
The SAP amendment will follow the protocol amendment .
9.1.Sample Siz e Determination
Study  sample size is not based on statistical considerations. In recognition of the variabilit y 
introduced with the inclusion of subject populations from various studies (such as population 
age, number of doses received, and concomitant va ccine usage), the study  aims to enroll up 
to [ADDRESS_172001] to 
particular variables.
9.2.Immunogenicity Analysis
This is a descriptive study; no h ypothesis testing will be performed. Therefore , an estimation 
approach will be utilized for immunogenicity .
The immunogenicity  descriptive summaries will be presented for the overall population as 
well as b y subgroup (eg, dose schedule, age group, administration of concomitant vaccine, 
region). A mi
xed model with repeated measures adjusted with covariates (dose schedule, age 
group, region, etc) will also be used to estimate the GMTs at different time points (including 
time points from the primary  studies).
The empi[INVESTIGATOR_149328] n curves (RCDCs) of hSBA titer will be 
presented graphicall y for each of the [ADDRESS_172002] strains will be conducted using sera obtained at Visits 1 
to 6 from all subjects entered into stage 1, including subjects who did not receive bivalent 
rLP2086 in the primary  study  (B1971015 Group 2). Serum samples collected at Visi ts 8, 10,
and [ADDRESS_172003] 
strains.
9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The proportion of subjects in each group achieving hSBA titer LLOQ at each blood 
sampling time point will be computed for each of the [ADDRESS_172004] 95% confidence intervals (CIs).26

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 20 -March -2017
Page 78For each of the primary  studies, there will be a descriptive comparison between the subjects 
enrolled in Study  B1971033 and the remaining subjects, to assess representative ness. This 
comparison will include demographic characteristics as well as immune responses 1 month 
after the final dose of bivalent rL P2086 or injected saline , such as the percentage of subjects 
with titers  LLOQ and GMTs to the [ADDRESS_172005] 
administration site and sy stemic events and use of antipy retic medication within the 7- day 
period after the booster vaccination w ill be descriptively  summarized.  Severities of local 
reactions and s ystemic events reported after vaccination will also be descriptively  
summarized.  Two (2) -sided exact 95% CIs will be presented with the proportions.
All of the AEs and RRIs will be categ orized according to the Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized. A medicall y attended event is 
defined as a nonserious AE that results in an evaluation at a medical facility. An NDCMC is 
defined as a disease or medica l condition not previously  identified that is expected to be 
persistent or otherwise long- lasting in its effects. All summaries will show the number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 event and the number of events. Two (2) -sided 
exact 95 %CIs will also be presented for the percentages.
9.6.Analysis Timing
Because of the timing of enrollment into the primary  studies, subjects will reach the booster 
stage of Study  B1971033 over an extended period. An interim anal ysis will be conducted 
after Vi sit 8 (1 month after the booster vaccination) immunogenicity  data for all subjects who 
participated in the B1971012 primary  study  are available. There may  also be an interim 
analysis when the B1971012 subjects have Visit 10 (12 months after the booster va ccination)
immunogenicity  data available.
The information will be used for internal decision making on further development of the 
vaccine, and will not modify  the current study .Since the study  is descriptive , there will be 
no ty pe I error imp act for these interim anal yses.
The final analy sis will be conducted once Visit 11 (26 months after the booster vaccination) 
immunogenicity  data for all e nrolled subjects are available.

Page 799.7.Data Monitoring Committee
This study will use an external data monitoring committee (EDMC). The independent 
statistical center (I SC) will provide the safet y reports to the EDMC. Safety  data will be 
reviewed b y the EDMC throughout the study  and no ty pe I error will be adjusted for the 
multiple looks at the data.
The EDMC will be respo nsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety  of subjects in the study .  
The recommendations made by [CONTACT_149349].  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may  include
summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y data thatare not endpoints, 
to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. The monitors may  review source documents 
to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will 
allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  authorities direct 
access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC, and/or to quality  assurance audits 
performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspectio n 
by [CONTACT_4708].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.
BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES
Blood samples will be used only  for scientific research. 
Each sample will be labeled with a 
code so that the laboratory  personnel testing the samples will not know the subject’s identity .
Any remaining sera will be stored, and may be used for additional assay s to assess immune 
response to vaccines given as part of this protocol or for assay  development. The sera will 
not be used for an y unrelated research and no genetic testing will be performed. The samples 
will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_172006]’s parent(s)/legal guardian may  request that his or her samples, if 
still identifiable, be destroy ed at any  time; however, an y data alread y collected from that 
sample will s till be used for this research. The serum samples will remain the propert y of the 
sponsor and may  be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality  is maintained.

12.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The invest igator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292].  An y corrections to ent ries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases, data colle cted on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
12.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent/assent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment dispo sition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to International Council for Harmonisation (I CH), 
according to local reg ulations, or as specified in the clinical study  agreement (CSA), 
whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel ynotified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by [CONTACT_13762].

PF-05212366 (Bivalent rLP2086)
B1971033
Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_172008] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
13.ETHICS
13.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent/assent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg, recruitment advertisements , if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC appro val is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
13.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Scienc es [CI OMS] 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki 
(World Medi cal Association 1996 and 2008).
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I CH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
13.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
or other identifiable data in any  reports, publications, or other disclosures , except where 
required b y law.
When study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_47581], subject 
names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code consisting 
of a numbering s ystem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  stud y subjects. The stud y 
site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study linking their 
numerical code to the subject’s actual identity . In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain 
high standards of confidentiality  and prot ection of subject personal data consistent with 
applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent/assent documents must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local 
regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consen t/assent documents used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed b y the sponsor, approved b y the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection.

Final Protocol Amendment 4, [ADDRESS_172009] not y et reached the legal age of majorit y.  It is to be understood as the 
child’s will to participate in a study  after having received age -appropriate information and is 
sometimes also referred to as "knowing agreement."
The investigat or must ensure that each study  subject, or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative, or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor, is fully  informed about the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative/parent(s) or 
legal guardian, the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently  be obtained 
when the subject has the capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC. If the 
investigator determines that a subject’s decisional capacity  is so limited he/she cannot 
reasonabl y be consulted, as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and 
legal requirements, then the subject’s assent may be waived with so urce documentation of 
the reason assent was not obtained. If the stud y subject does not provide his/her own 
consent, the source documents must record wh y the subject did not provide consent 
(eg, minor, decisionall y impaired adult), how the investigator d etermined that the person 
signing the consent was the subject’s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer’s 
relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, spouse), and that the subject’s assent was 
obtained, or waived. If assent is obtained ve rbally, it must be documented in the source 
documents.
If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as 
recognized under local law, they  must be reconsented as adults to remain in the study .If the 
enrollment of "ema ncipated minors" is permitted by  [CONTACT_74100], the I RB/EC, and 
local law, they  must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the 
permission of a parent or legal guardian.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the invest igator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative, parent(s), or legal 
guardian and the subject’s assent, when applicable, before an y stud y-specific activity  is 
performed, unless a waiver of i nformed consent has been granted b y an IRB/EC. The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent document.
13.4. Subject Recruitment
Subject recruitment efforts are not required for this study  because ,as of protocol 
amendment 3, all subjects have been enrolled.
13.5.
Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] s hould be informed immediately .

stated in the regulatory  application (ie, clinical trial application [CT A]) and ethics application 
in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the 
CTA) by  a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
14.2. End of Trial in All Other Participating Countries
End of trial in all other participating countries is defined as the end of the clinical phase of 
the study , which will be [ADDRESS_172011] study  visit ( Visit 11) for the last subject 
(LSLV). At this time, sites will be closed out, the IRB/EC will be informed, and no furt her 
CIOMS reports will be sent.
15.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100] /EC, drug safety  problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  I n 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of bivalent rLP2086 at an y time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the 
investigator .
After notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_8906][INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) immediatel y. As directed b y [COMPANY_007], all study  materials

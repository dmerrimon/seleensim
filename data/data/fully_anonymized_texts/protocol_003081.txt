 Title: Seizure Prophylaxis in Aneurysm Repair (SPAR)  
 
Principal Investigators:  
Cormac Maher, MD, B. Gregory Thompson, MD, Aditya Pandey, MD   
 
OVERVIEW  
 
Research Objectives: 
To examine the utility of levetiracetam (UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) for seizure 
prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgical repair of ruptured and unruptured intracranial 
aneurysms. 
 
Hypothesis: 
No difference exists in seizure frequency post-aneurysm treatment between the levetiracetam and 
no levetiracetam groups.   
 
Background information and Rationale:  
Seizures are a potential complication of surgical repair of intracranial aneurysms.  In order to 
prevent seizures, many surgeons administer prophylactic anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685866]-operative and post-operative period; however, such practice is not supported by [CONTACT_50734] [Raper et al].   A recent retrospective review found that the incidence of postoperative 
seizures following intracranial aneurysm surgery was actually higher in those who received anti-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_685867] [Raper et al.].  Given the retrospective nature of this study, it 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_929722] 
also suggested that antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_685868] [Sbeih et al., Rhoney et al.].  
Recent information on patients undergoing surgery for supratentorial brain tumors has also cast 
some doubt on the efficacy of seizure prophylaxis.  A recent trial randomized 123 patients 
undergoing craniotomy for resection of supratentorial tumors to either perioperative seizure 
prophylaxis with phenytoin or no seizure prophylaxis [Lang et al].  These investigators found 
that prophylactic use of anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685869].  They suggested that the routine use 
of prophylactic anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685870].   
 
The strongest argument in favor of routine use of anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685871]-operative seizures decreased compared with historical controls following the 
implementation of prophylaxis [Ohman et al., Bidzinski et al.]. 
 
In 2009, an expert panel convened by [CONTACT_685884]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685872] [Bederson et al].  Although this 
group did not make any recommendations regarding the use of prophylactic anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685873], the risk of seizures, and therefore the 
potential benefits of seizure prophylaxis, appears to be lower in these patients compared with 
those with ruptured intracranial aneurysms Bederson et al., Baker et al]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of 
evidence for the use of anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685874] 1.[ADDRESS_929723] 
common drug used for perioperative anti-seizure prophylaxis for many years, it has now been 
replaced by [CONTACT_685885] a perception that it is easier to administer 
and has fewer side effects [Zachenhofer et al, Milligan et al, Szaflarski et al., Lim et al].  The use 
of levetiracetam rather than phenytoin will reflect the practice pattern of most centers across the 
[LOCATION_002].

 Timeline: Prospective data for subjects will be collected on a secure file with password access 
for until up to 10 years after all data is published. 
 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:  
Inclusion:   
1. Adult (≥18 years)  
2. Presence of intracranial aneurysm (with or without rupture) 
3. Patients with unruptured aneurysms must be recommended for microsurgery. Patients 
with ruptured aneurysms should be recommended for clippi[INVESTIGATOR_605817]. 
Exclusion:   
1. History of seizures within last 10 years 
2. History of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] 
3. History of prior stroke 
4. Currently prescribed medication with anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_41726] (keppra, dilantin, tegretol, 
lamictal, topamax, etc.) 
5. Brain tumor 
6. Pregnant or nursing woman 
7. Known levetiracetam allergy 
 
Recruitment:  
All patients seen at the University of Michigan Health System that meet inclusion criteria are 
currently seen by [CONTACT_685886].  Prior to surgery, the study 
Version 1.4  07-DEC-2022

 will be explained to potential subjects and/or their legally authorized representatives by [CONTACT_685887] a qualified study team member and they will be able to ask any questions that 
they may have. In addition, they may contact [CONTACT_978] (by [CONTACT_648], email, or mail). The investigators 
will recruit from their own patient population.  No additional patient recruitment will be pursued. 
 
Design:  
Patients that meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to either a “levetiracetam” or “no 
levetiracetam” group.  There will be no attempt to “blind” the patient or caregivers with respect 
to group assignment.  The group assignment will be known to the patient as well as relevant 
caregivers. 
Patients in both groups will be treated according to all current reasonable clinical practices for 
the surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms and its postoperative care.  With the single 
exception of prophylactic levetiracetam administration to only one group, there will be no 
differences by [CONTACT_685888]. 
Those assigned to the “levetiracetam” group will receive a 500 mg intravenous dose during the 
operative case and then will be maintained on 500 mg orally twice a day for a total of seven days 
Those patients that are assigned to the “no levetiracetam” group will receive no levetiracetam or 
any other anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_685875].  The use of any anti-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_685876]. 
As is typi[INVESTIGATOR_685877], patients will be 
monitored in the neurological intensive care unit for at least one day following surgery.  The 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_929724] to the patient’s group 
assignment in the study. 
A dataset will be prospectively assembled on each patient included in the study.  Recorded 
information will include patient age, gender, location of aneurysm, size of aneurysm, duration of 
surgery, surgeon’s assessment of degree of brain retraction during surgery (on a 3 point scale: 
less than average, average, more than average), the surgeon’s degree of cortical damage during 
surgery (on a 3 point scale: less than average, average, more than average), the occurrence of an 
intraoperative hemorrhage, the occurrence of any other unexpected intraoperative events, the 
dose of levetiracetam and the duration of administration, any side effects or possible side effects 
of levetiracetam, the dose and duration of administration of any other anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_72467], 
the occurrence of any seizures including the number of such events, their duration, their 
treatment, and their sequelae if any.   
Assessments will occur at routine care follow-up visits. These visits typi[INVESTIGATOR_685878] 1-2 
months, 4-6 months, and 6-12 months and up until 5 years +/- [ADDRESS_929725] the patient via the telephone 
to try to obtain their 5-year clinical status.  
The patient may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the treating physician or patient does 
not believe it is in the patient’s best interest to continue to participate.  All such instances will be 
recorded. 
INFORMED CONSENT  
When patients are seen in their physician’s clinic for standard clinical care, the study will be 
explained to them by [CONTACT_9682] (a study team investigator) or another qualified study team 
member and they will be able to ask any questions that they may have. In addition, they may 
contact [CONTACT_978] (by [CONTACT_648], email, or mail). Patients with ruptured aneurysms will be seen by a 
study investigator and informed consent may be obtained by [CONTACT_685889]. 
An attempt will be made by [CONTACT_685890]. In this case, a comprehensive telephone consent will be used to collect 
this information and the interaction will be recorded and maintained in the subject’s study 
record.  
 
PROCEDURES FOR MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY  
Data Security: Subjects will be given an ID number after being enrolled in the trial. Their ID 
number will be used on their data collection sheets. A linkage file will be maintained with patient 
identifiers to enable the study team to conduct chart reviews to extract data and monitor adverse 
events. Patient information will be de-identified prior to entry into the database. The database 
will be password-protected.  The linkage file will be maintained in a secure, electronic database 
Version 1.4  07-DEC-2022 
8 
 for ten years following the close of the study. At that time, patient identifiers other than study ID 
will be destroyed.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Risks:  
Levetiracetam will not be given to half of the study subjects.  Although levetiracetam is often 
used in these patients for seizure prophylaxis, its utility has never been established.   A recent 
randomized trial found that prophylactic administration of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_685879].  Therefore levetiracetam administration should not be considered standard 
treatment and withholding this medication falls within the scope of reasonable clinical 
practice. 
Levitiracetam is associated with side effects in some cases.  A recent trial of levitiracetam 
prophylaxis found that 1 patient had an adverse drug reaction out of 105 patients that were 
treated with this drug in the perioperative period [Milligan et al]. 
As with most anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_72467], levetiracetam appears to have some teratogenic 
potential.  This potential appears to be dose dependent.  All women of child-bearing age will 
undergo pregnancy testing prior to treatment per UMHS routine care practices.  Pregnant women 
will be excluded from this study and will be treated according to standard practices of the 
treating physician.  
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality.  This risk is considered minimal and will be reduced by 
[CONTACT_685891]-identified data sets on password protected files.

 Benefits: Participating subjects may benefit from increased monitoring by [CONTACT_685892]. Subjects in the levetiracetam group may benefit from reduced incidence 
of seizure. Subjects in the no levetiracetam group may benefit from a reduced indicence of side 
effects. Additionally, the study will yield important information to the community of physicians 
and researchers, and ultimately their patients; thus, there will be benefits to society. 
 
ANALYSIS OF DATA  
The two groups will be compared to verify that no significant differences in group composition 
were present.  The treatment and no treatment groups will then be compared with respect to the 
occurrence of seizures including their frequency and duration.  The treatment and no treatment 
groups will be compared with respect to the occurrence of levetiracetam side effects or possible 
side effects.  Significance will be determined at p<0.05. 
Up to 100 subjects will be recruited for this study. An interim analysis maybe conducted at any 
time during this study.

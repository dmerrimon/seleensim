 5  • To explore the relationship between baseline ADAM9 expression and antitumor activity 
• To explore ocular primary prophylaxis regimens  
Study Design:   
This study is a Phase 1 /2, first in human, open-label, dose- escalation and expansion study designed to 
characterize the safety, tolerability, PK , immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of 
IMGC936.  
Participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors 
including non-squamous non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC), 
colorectal cancer (CRC), gastroesophageal cancer, or pancreatic cancer will be enrolled.  
Planned trea tment for both the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion P hase consists of 
IMGC936 administered via intravenous ( IV) infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and every subsequent 21-
day cycle thereafter (Schedule A,  Appendix  1) or IV infusion on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of Cycle 1 
and 2, foll ow
ed by  [CONTACT_451394] 1 and Day 8 in Cycle 3 and beyond of a 28 -day cycle (Schedule 
B, Appendix 2) . Participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, AE requiring 
discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or other discontinuation criteria are met 
(Section  5.4).  
Dose Escala
tion Phase  
The Dose Escalation Phase is designed to determine the MTD or MAD, if no MTD is defined, and 
select an RP2D. Dose escalation follows a conventional 3 + 3 design: successive cohorts of [ADDRESS_575515] administration of IMGC936 (Cycle 1 ) in participants at the first [ADDRESS_575516] 48 hours.  
The DLT evaluation period is 21 days for Schedule A and 28 days for Schedule B. 
During the D ose Escalation Phase, at the discretion of the s ponsor, any dose escalation cohort at a 
dose level not exceeding the MTD may be expanded to a maximum of 1 5 participants for further 
evaluation of safety, PK, antitumor activity, to facilitate selection of the RP2D . Intermediate dose 
levels, not exceeding the MTD, may also be explored. 
Dose Expansion Phase  
The Dose Expansion P hase is designed to explore efficacy of IMGC936 at the RP2D  as a single-agent 
in study participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid 
tumors. 
Upon completion of the D ose Escalation Phase of the study, following determination of the RP2D, 
and at the sponsor ’s discretion , up to 7 expansion cohorts may  be opened in t umor types selected from 
those enrolled in dose escalation.  
Up to 39 evaluable participants may be enrolled into each expansion cohort (up to 273 participants).  
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575517] 13 pa rticipants  (Section 14.1)  in each expansion 
cohort. If there are at least [ADDRESS_575518] stage, an 
additional 26 pa rticipants  may be recruited to that cohort (a total of 39 participants) to further evaluate 
safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, biomarkers, antitumor activity, and survival of participants 
who received IMGC936.  
The expansion cohorts may test more than 1 dose and/or schedule, not exceeding the MTD. 
Tumor specimens for determination of ADAM9 expression via immunohistochemical staining will be 
collected from all participants and will be assayed at a central laboratory designated by [CONTACT_456]. ADAM9 testing results are not required for enrollment.  
Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phases  
During both the D ose Escalation and the Dose Expansion phases of the study, safety and tolerability 
will be closely followed. Further, PK, immunogenicity, antitumor activity, and survival assessments 
will occur (Appendix  1 and Appendix 4).  
Safety Monitoring: 
Dose Escalation Phase  
For guiding dose- escalation decisions, DLTs will be defined based on treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) or abnormal laboratory values that occur up to study Day 21 of Cycle 1 (Schedule A) 
or study Day 28 of Cycle 1 (Schedule B). AE severity will be graded according to National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Dose Expansion Phase  
Safety will be evaluated continuously and in aggregate in the expansion cohorts ( Section 4.3 ). Safety 
assessments will be based on all TEAEs and abnormal laboratory values.  
Number of participants  (planned):  
Up to a maximum of  345 participants  will be enrolled in the study if all expansion cohorts are fully 
enrolled . 
Dose Escalation Phase  
Up to  45 evaluable participants may be enrolled in Schedule A depending on results during the study 
and number of dose levels explored. If Schedule B is explored, up to 27  evaluable participant s may be 
enrolled. This number does not account for replacement of non- evaluable p articipants or the 
possibility of expanding an individual dose escalation cohort to a maximum of  15 participants to 
allow for further evaluation of safety, PK, and antitumor activity at that dose level. 
Dose Expansion Phase  
Up to 39 evaluable p articipants  may be enrolled in each of the 5-7 expansion cohorts.  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
The population to be enrolled consists of adults with relapsed or refractory, unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic non -squamous NSCLC, TNBC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer, or pancreatic 
cancer for whom no therapy with demonstrated clinical benefit is available.  
Participants must have good performance status, adequate end organ function, and no serious 
concurrent illnesses that would  increase the risk to the participant or confound study data. 
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration: 
IMGC936 is an antibody -drug conjugate that consists  of an  ADAM9 -targeting monoclonal antibody 
and a tubulin -targeting maytansinoid payload, conjugated . IMGC936 dose will be determined during 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc

 Confidential and Proprietary  
 7  dose escalation (range 0.5 to 12 mg/kg) and is administered intravenously by [CONTACT_451395] A and Schedule B ( Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) .  
Duration of treatment:  
Participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, AE requiring discontinuation, 
withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or other discontinuation criteria are met. 
It is expected that enrollment for the Dose Escalation Phase of the study will occur over 
approximately [ADDRESS_575519] of the trial. 
Criteria for evaluation: 
Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase  Assessments  
Safety Assessments:  
The safety assessment will be based on evaluation of AEs that occur from the time of initiation of 
administration of study drug through the end of treatment visit (EOTV) or [ADDRESS_575520] 
dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent anti cancer therapy (whichever occurs first) and will 
be determined based on signs, symptoms, physical examination findings, and/or laboratory test results from enrolled participants as appropriate.  
Ongoing AEs considered related to study drug will be followed until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], initiation of another anticancer 
therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up (LTFU ), or death . 
Progression of the underlying tumor resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] ( eg, participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451351] ( PD) only, without any other serious adverse event [SAE]) will 
be documented as a PD outcome and not as an SAE. 
Response Assessments:  
Tumor assessments will be obtained  using computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
scans. Target and non- target lesions will be designated at screening and then evaluated after every 
other cycle, ie, every 6  weeks (± 7 days) on Schedule A and every 8 weeks (± 7 days) on Schedul e B 
while on study drug. 
At each tumor assessment time point, the overall response status will be determined based on 
assessment of target and non -target lesions as well as appearance of any new lesions. For RECIST 
v1.1, the overall responses will be categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), 
stable disease, PD, or not evaluable.  
If feasible, participants who discontinue study drug for reasons other than PD, (eg, toxicity, 
participant request) should continue to undergo tumor assessments  every 12 weeks  (± 21 days) until 
evidence of PD, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, LTFU, death, or end 
of study, whichever occurs first.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
Serum concentrations of conjugated antibody and total antibody following administration of 
IMGC936 will be monitored using quantitative validated bioanalytical methods. DM50/51 payload 
levels will be measured from plasma using a validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass 
spectrometry assay. Metabolites of IMGC9 36 may also be evaluated. Single and multiple- dose PK 
parameters will be derived from serum or plasma concentration versus time data as applicable.  
Immunogenicity Assessments: 
Antidrug antibodies against IMGC936 will be evaluated using a validated analytic al method.

 8  Biomarkers:  
Exploratory biomarker assessments are described in the protocol.  
Analysis Populations: Two populations will be used for this analysis: the Safety Population and the 
Response Evaluable Population as defined below. 
Safety Population: All pa rticipants who received at least one dose of study drug. This population will 
be used for analyses of safety, PK, and immunogenicity. It will also be used for summary of baseline 
data and analyses of PFS. 
Response Evaluable Population: All pa r ticipants who received at least one dose of study drug, had 
baseline measurable or non -measurable disease, and had at least one post -baseline radiographic tumor 
assessment or discontinued from study drug due to clinical progression or death if no post -baseline 
tumor assessment. This population will be used for summary of tumor assessment data and analyses 
of response rates. 
Statistical methods:   
A separate statistical analysis plan will further describe the details regarding statistical methods and  
will govern the analysis.  
Sample Size : The s tudy plans to treat up to approximately 45 participants in dose escalation  on 
Schedule A and up to 27 participants on Schedule B . The sample size is based on a 3  + 3 design with 
7 planned dose cohorts of IMGC936. Additional participants may be enrolled if a dose cohort is expanded, participants are replaced, or intermediate dose levels are evaluated.  
Each expansion cohort may be expanded independently following a n optima l 
 Simon’s 2-stage design . 
If there are at least [ADDRESS_575521] stage, each may 
enroll an additional 26 participants to that cohort (a total of 39 participants).  
Safety : Treatment -emerg e nt AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_451396], by 
[CONTACT_8792] s, and by [CONTACT_49241]. Summaries of laboratory values will display 
descriptive statistics for numerically quantified laboratory results.  
Efficacy : Number and percent of participants with their best overall response will be summarized. 
Objective response rate will be calculated as the proportion of participants in the Response Evaluable 
Population achieving a best response of CR or PR. Response rates will be determined using RECIST 
v1.1. Two -sided  95% exact binomi al confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated around the 
response rates. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estimate duration of response and PFS.

Abbreviations: FPI: [INVESTIGATOR_451352]; PFS: progression -free survival; QXW: every X weeks; RP2D : recommended Phase [ADDRESS_575522] dose of 
study drug or until subsequent start of anticancer therapy.  
Tumor assessments occur every 2 cycles during treatment ( Q6W for Schedule A and Q8W for Schedule B) and Q12W if the participant has discontinued study 
treatment for reasons other than progressive disease . 
Participants enrolled on Schedule B will receive study drug on Days 1, 8, and [ADDRESS_575523] 2 cycles. On all subsequent cycles (Cycle 3 and 
beyond), participants  will receive study drug on Days 1 and 8 of a 28- day cycle. The 3 + 3 dose escalation will apply to the alternate schedule. The starting dose 
for Schedule B will be equal to or less than the fractionated total dose of the maximum tolerated dose or maximum administered dose on the original every 3 
weeks  schedule.  
1 Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity will be assessed throughout the study (Appendix  4 and Appendix 5 ).  
2 Participants who discontinue before progressio n of disease will be followed for PFS after end of  study treatment.

20 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1. Rationale for Study
Antibody- drug conj ugates ( A DCs) h ave emerged as a class of t herapeutic agents for t argeted 
trea
tment of cancer. ADC s combi ne the tumor target specificity of a monoclona l antibody (mAb) 
with highly pote nt cytotoxi c “payloads ” for selecti ve delivery of cytotoxi c agents to cance r cells. 
Targeted d elivery of cytotoxic agents t o canc er  cells offers t he pot ential for in creased ef ficacy 
while minimizing exposur e to norma l tissues, thereby [CONTACT_451398] t he therapeuti c window. 
ADAMs ( a disintegrin a nd me talloproteinase) are a family of tr a nsmembrane me talloproteinases 
that contri
bute to vari ous cellula r processe s including growth fact or and cytoki ne signaling, cell-
cell interactions, adhesion, and extracellula r matrix remodeling (Ori a 2018 ). ADAMs also a c t as 
ligands for integri ns by [CONTACT_451399]. Furthermore, rece nt studie s demonstrate 
that s everal A DAMs ar e highly expressed i n can cer cel ls and can cer t issues. A DA M9 ( a 
disintegrin and metalloproteas e domain-containing protein 9) is a nove l membe r of t he ADAM 
fam
ily. Dysregulation of ADAM9 ha s been implicated in tum or pr ogression and metastasis, as 
well as pathologic al ne ovascularization.  
ADA
M9 i s an attracti ve target for tumor therapy becaus e of its overexpression in many 
malignant tumors and limited expression in normal tissues. Many solid tumor types overexpress 
ADAM9 (Fritzsche 2008a, Fritzsche 2008b, Franzke 2009, Fan 2016, Hicks 2019), including, 
but not limited to non-squamous non-sm all cel
l lung cancer (NSCLC) (Chiu 2017, Kossmann 
2017, Lin 2017, Hicks 2019), t riple-ne gative breast cancer (TNBC) (Hicks 2019), colorectal  
cancer (CR
C) (Li 2013) , gastroesophageal can cer ( Hicks 2019) , and p ancreatic cancer 
(G
rut
zmann 2004,  Hicks 2019, Ori a 2019) . ADAM9 overexpression i s as sociated w ith mul tiple 
advers e cli
nical and pa thol ogical features of di sease, i ncreased risk of cancer recurrence, and 
reduce
d surviva l (Izum i 1998, Karadag 2006, Genin 2015) .  
The spons or 
will develop IMGC936 in advanced solid tumor s incl uding non-squam ous NSCLC, 
TNBC, CRC, gastroesophagea l cancer, and pancreati c cancer. Nonclinica l developme nt includes 
safety evaluation in severa l models, including Good Laboratory Practic e (GLP ) toxicology in 
cynomol gus monkeys. 
2.2. Disease Background  
This first -in-human clinical trial will evaluate the safety and initial antitumor  activity of single -
agent IMGC936 in participants with relapsed or refractory, locally advanced, unresectable or 
metastatic solid tumors known to express high levels of ADAM9 including non-squamous 
NSCLC, TNBC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The rationale for 
selecting these distinct types of cancer without prescreening for ADAM9 expression is based on the relatively high level of ADAM9 expression observed in these cancers and the unmet medical need for patients with these advanced dis eases.  
Differential response to therapeutic mAbs correlates with specific polymorphisms of fragment crystallizable ( Fc) gamma receptors (FcγRs ), which are key mediators of antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (Mellor 2013). Thus, an exploratory objective of the study is to investigate 
the relationship between FcγR genotype and antitumor activity of IMGC936.

2.2.1. Non-Squamous Non- S
mall Cell Lung Cancer   
Lung cance r is the second mos t commonly diagnosed cance r worldwide . In 2020, an estimated 
2.2 million  new cases of lung cance r were diagnosed globally, accounting f or approximately 
11.4% of t he global cancer bur den (Sung 2021). In 2020, an estimated 228,820 adults 
(116,300 men and 112,520 women) in the [LOCATION_002] (US) will be diagnosed with 
lung cancer 
(Siegel 2020) . An immunohistochemistry (IHC) screen of non-squamous NSCLC specimens 
reveal
ed tha t 86 of 86 tota l specime ns (100% ) exhibited ADAM9 expression a t any level, while 
60 of 86 (70% ) had H-score s > 100 (ie, moderat e or strong expressi on) (Hicks 2019) . 
In the first-line tre atme nt setting, due to the introduction of new drugs and patie nt selection ba s ed 
on histologica l subtype s and drive r mutations that influenc e the biology of thes e malignancies, 
median overal l surviva l (OS) for pa tients with advanced non-squam ous NS CLC r eceiving 
platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with agent s targeting specifi c histologie s and 
mutati ons has improved to 12 mont hs or longe r in controlled studie s (Reck 2013) . However, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a vailability of multiple tr eatment opt ions i n the s econd -line setting , clinical outcomes 
remai
n poor. Respons e rates are, on average, les s than 10%, and media n OS is 7 to 9 months 
from
 start of s ec ond-line therapy (Zer and Lei ghl 2014) .  
ADAM9 i s expressed on a high percenta ge of non-squam ous NSCLC tumor s and promote s an 
aggressi ve phenotype of adenocarcinom a xenograft s in mic e (Kossmann 2017). In addition, high 
expres
sion of ADAM9 i s linked to poor prognosi s in lung adenocarcinom a patient s (Lin 2017). 
Thes e observati ons provide rational e for targeting ADAM9 wit h IMGC [ADDRESS_575535] c ancer in females is now the leading caus e of cancer , with an estimated  
2.3 m illion ne w cases in 2020. I t is the fi
fth leading caus e of cancer mor tality worldwide with 
685,000 deaths (Sung 2021). In the US, approximately 
281,[ADDRESS_575536] 
cancer in women are predicted to occur in 2021, along with 2650 cases in men (Siegel 2021). 
Approximately 10% to
 20% of breast cancers known as TNBC are negative for estrogen receptor, 
progesterone receptor, and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) (Li 2019) . TNBC 
is associated with a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer. 
An IHC screen of TNBC 
specimens, revealed that 20 of 20 total specimens (100%) exhibited ADAM9 expression at any 
level, while 13 of 
20 (65%) had H scores > 100 (ie, moderate or strong expression) (Hicks 2019). 
A recent study by [CONTACT_451400]. suggests a novel molecular mechanism in which proteolytic 
cleavage by 
[CONTACT_17873]9
 releases stable homotrimers of tumor necrosis f actor-α from the membrane. 
This in turn activates signaling leading to a metastatic TNBC phenotype (Zhou 2019). 
Among available historical data, commonly used chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_451353], limited survival benefit, and challenging toxicity profiles, suggesting a considerable 
unmet medical 
need in metastatic TNBC (Li 2019). Therapeutic regimens that result in 
improved, sustainable clinical responses and longer survival, along with more manageable safety 
profiles, are still needed for patients with metastatic TNBC.

22 2.2.3. Colorectal Cancer 
According to GLOBOCAN 2020, it is estimated that approximately 1,191,590 new cases of CRC 
were diagnosed worldwide (1,148,515 colon cancer, 732,210 rectal cancer, and 53,583 anus 
cancer). In 2020, there were approximately 935,173 new deaths from colorectal cancer (576,858 
colon cancer, 339,022 rectal cancer, and 19,293 anus cancer). Together, CRCs are the third most 
commonly diagnosed form of cancer, comprising about 10% of all cancer diagnoses, and the 
second leading cause of cancer death worldwide is CRC (Bray 2018) . Ann ually, approximately 
147,950 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed in the US, of which 104,610 are colon 
cancer, and the remainder are rectal cancer (Siegel 2020) . An IHC screen of CRC specimens 
revealed that 12 of 15 total specimens (80%) exhibited ADAM9 expression at any level, while 6 
of 15 (40%) had H scores ≥ 100 (ie, moderate or strong expression) ( Hicks 2019) .  
Research by [CONTACT_451401]. suggest that ADAM9 contributes to cell invasion and progression in colon cancer (Li 2013) . Chemotherapy for metastatic CRC has evolved significantly in the past decade 
with incorporation of biologics and targeted therapy, which has improved survival. In the US, 5 
year survival rates for CRC, diagnosed during 2009 through 2015, were 64% for all disease 
stages but only 14% for those with distant metastases ( Siegel 2020) . Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_451354], life expectancy remains limited in patients with advanced metastatic CRC. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the prognosis. 
2.2.4. Gastroesophageal Cancer 
Based on GLOBOCAN 2020 data, gastric cancer is the fourth  leading cause of cancer death 
worldwide, and esophageal cancer r anks eighth in terms of incidence and sixth in mortality 
(Sung 2021) . Gastric cancer has the fifth highest incidence among cancers, with 5.7% of all new 
cases attributable to the disease. Over a million new cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed 
worldwide each year ( Sung 2021) . In 2020, an estimated 27,600 (16,980 men and 10,620 
women) in the US were diagnosed with gastric cancer, with an estimated 11,010 deaths (6,650 men and 4,360 women) (Siegel 2020) . In 2020, 604,100 cases of esophageal cancers were 
diagnosed worldwide (Sung 2021). An estimated 18,440 new esophageal canc er cases will be 
diagnosed (14,350 in men and 4,090 in women), with about 16,170 deaths from esophageal cancer (13,100 in men and 3,070 in women) in the US. 
Gastroesophageal cancer is associated with high mortality and poor prognosis, as it is often 
diagnosed at an advanced stage ( Howlader 2020) . In the US, the 5-year survival rate is 32% for 
gastric cancer and 20% for esophageal cancer. Average survival rates for gastroesophageal 
cancer reflect the fact that many cases are already metastatic at diagnosis. For those with distant metastases, 5 -year survival is 5%. 
An IHC screen of gastric cancer specimens revealed that 15 of 15 total specimens (100%) exhibited ADAM9 expression at any level, while 11 of 15 (73%) had H scores > 100 (ie, 
moderate or strong expression) ( Hicks 2019) . An IHC screen of esophageal cancer tissue 
microarray cores revealed that 18 of 19 total cores (95%) exhibited ADAM9 expression at any 
level, while 7 of 19 (37%) had H scores > 100 (unpublished data). 
For patients with advanced- stage gastric cancer, treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_451355]-based combination chemotherapy and is associated with a median OS of 7 to 
10 months ( Wagner 2006 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_451356],

23 only 40% of pa tients who progressed to first- line chemotherapy are susceptible to a second- line 
chemotherapy on progression (Pellino 2019) . Chemotherapy f or metastatic es ophageal canc er i s 
considered to be a palliative approach, mea nt to alleviat e symptom s like dysphagia. Treatment 
aims to impr ove sym ptom- free s urvival with limite d if a ny at all, pos itive effect on O S. The mos t 
c
ommon cyt
otoxi c approache s involve combination therapie s with a platinum- based ag ent  like 
carboplatin, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin, taxane or fluorouracil. In the US, median OS  f
or metastatic 
esophageal cancer with cytotoxic and/or radiation therapy is only 
8 to 10 months (Barsouk 
2019). Consequently, there is an urgent, unmet need for targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451357]. Although newe r therapie s have impr oved surviva l for advanced 
cases of g astroesophageal j unction and ga str ic cancer, t here remains a significant m edical n eed 
for addi
tional treatment o ptions .  
2.2.5. Pancreatic 
Cancer  
Globally, panc reatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death with an estimated 
432,242 deaths and 458,918 new cases in 2018 ( Bray 2018). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_451358], the 5-year survival rate stands at 9% only ( Siegel 2020). An estimated 57,600 
new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed in the US, with an estimated 47,050 deaths in 
2020. An IHC screen of pancreatic cancer specimens revealed that 20 of 20 total specimens 
(100%) ex hibited ADAM9 expression at any level, while 17 of 20 (85%) had H- scores > 100 ( ie, 
moderate or strong expression) ( Hicks 2019).  
Evaluation of second-line therapy in randomized trials indicates that 16 to 57% of patients with pancreatic cancer receive salvage chemotherapy after failure of first -line gemcitabine 
(Heinemann 2012 ). Median OS in gemcitabine- resistant patients receiving best supportive care 
was 2.3 months in a small randomized trial ( Heinemann 2012) .  
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells overexpress ADAM9, and increased ADAM9 expression 
correlates with poor tumor grading and the presence of vasculature invasion ( Oria 2019) . 
Similarly, Grutzmann et al. demonstrated that ADAM9 is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinomas and that cytoplasmic ADAM9 expression associates with poor survival in 
patients who underwent curative resection of these tumors ( Grutzmann 2004) . Thus, ADAM9 
may be a potential target for treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.  
2.3. IMGC936 
IMGC936 is an ADC targeted against ADAM9. IMGC936 consists of the maytansinoid DM21 -C conjugated to the MGA021 antibody via a cleavable peptide linker. Maytansinoids are 
anti-mitotic agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly. MGA021 is a 
humanized, IgG1/kappa mAb that recognizes human ADAM9 antigen and is cross- reactive with 
cynomolgus monkey ADAM9. MGA021 is composed of 2 IgG1 heavy chains of 452 amino acids and 2 kappa light chains of 218 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 147,425 Da. 
The triple mutation M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) is incorporated into the Fc portion of 
IMGC936 to improve the neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) binding at acidic pH and therefore 
enhance pharmacokinetic properties. In IMGC936, each antibody molecule is conjugated to 
approximately 2.0 molecules of DM21-C (drug to antibody ratio of ~1.5- 2.2) via site specific 
conjugation to engineered cysteine residues at position 442 of the IgG1 heavy chains. Owing to

2.4. IMGC936 Benefit/Risk in Humans  
IMGC936 is an investigational drug with safety data available from nonclinical studies. No 
information is available about the adverse effects of IMGC936 in humans; therefore, as with any 
new product, administration of IMGC936 may involve risks that are currently unforeseen. 
IMGC936 is an ADC that may lead to killing of the tumor cell. Based on the mechanism of 
action and the risks associated with similar drugs, infusion- related reactions, hematologic 
toxicity, ocular toxicity, and interstitial cystitis are potential risks of IMGC936 treatment.   
2.5. Nonclinical Background on IM GC936 
Nonclinical studies necessary to support clinical studies have been performed and are 
summarized below. Further information can be obtained in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.5.1. IMGC936 Nonclinical Experience  
[IP_ADDRESS].  IMGC936 Pharmacology 
The nonclinical pharmacology program was designed to characterize the binding affinity and 
biological activity of IMGC936 in vitro and in vivo and is briefly summarized below. Further 
details are in the IMGC936 Investigator’s Brochure. 
I
MGC936 is an ADC targeted against ADAM 9. IMGC936 consists of the mayta nsinoid 
DM21- C conjugated t o MGA021a  cleava ble peptide linker. Maytansinoids are anti -mitotic 
agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly. MGA021 is a humanized, 
IgG1/kappa mAb that recognizes human ADAM 9 antigen and is cross-reactive with cynomolgus 
monkey ADAM9. MGA021 is composed of 2 IgG1 heavy chains of 452 amino acids and 2 
kappa light chains of 218 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 147,4 25 Daltons. The triple 
mutation M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) is incorporated into the Fc) portion of MGA021 to 
im
prove the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding profile and enhance pharmacokinetic ( PK) 
properties . In IMGC936, eac h antibody molecule is conjugat ed to approximately 2.0 molecules 
of DM21-C (drug to antibody ratio of ~1.5–2.2) via site specific conjugation to engineered 
cysteine residues at position 442 of the heavy chains. 
Binding of IMGC936 to its target antigen was characterized by [CONTACT_386540] (SPR) 
using recombinant soluble human and cynomolgus ADAM9; IMGC936 binds with high affinity 
towa rd human (1.1 nM) and cynomolgus monkey (1.8 nM) ADAM 9. Following binding to cell 
surf
ace ADAM 9 and internalization of IMGC 936 through endocytosis, the peptide li nker is 
cleaved by [CONTACT_451402], such a s cathepsin B, and r elease of i ntracellular D M21- C-Cys. 
The DM21-C-Cys catabolite unde rgoes further proteolysis to release the active maytansinoid 
catabolite DM51. DM 51 may also undergo S meth ylation to the related active catabolite, DM50.

A summary 
of nonclinical PK and toxicology data are prov ided below. Please see the IMGC936 
Investigator’s Brochure for further details. 
I
MGC936 was administered to cynomolgus monkeys in toxicology studies that included single-
dose (25 mg/kg) and repeat-dose (3 to 22.5 mg/kg/dose) studies at 2-week i ntervals f or a total of 
ei
ther 2 or 3 doses. A single dose of 25 mg/kg was well tolerated; repeat-dose study results are 
described b elow. 
Similar target expression was observed between a panel of human and cynomolgus monkey 
ti
ssues exa mined i n a tissue cross -reactivi ty study. The results showed that IMGC936 bound to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_451359] . IMGC936- related m icroscopic

26 cause of these are unknown and a relationship to IMGC936 cannot be ruled out; however, 
IMGC936 does not bind to myocardium and there were no findings noted in electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), heart rate, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487].  
Maytansinoids are known to cause ocular toxicity when used as the payload in ADCs. 
IMGC936-related ophthalmic findings were observed in both repeat-dose nonclinical studies and 
included discharge, conjunctival swelling, congestion and/or cloudiness, pannus, cellular or keratic pr ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263], and corneal pi[INVESTIGATOR_451362]. All findings showed either complete or ongoing resolution at the end of the recovery period. 
Across all GLP studies, there were no findings for changes in body weight, food consumption, 
ECGs (including jacketed external telemetry conducted in the GLP study on Day 15, [ADDRESS_575541] 21 hours postdose), blood pressure, heart rate, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. Non-adverse changes in clinical pathology parameters were observed after 3 biweekly repeat -doses 
and were transient, mild, and did not result in any microscopic correlates. 
PK analysis showed accumulation of conjugated and total antibody as well as unconjugated 
DM51 when IMGC936 repeat doses were administered at 2-week intervals. The human cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_575542] non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) for IMGC936 
was 10 mg/kg/dose administered as a 10- minute intravenous ( IV) infusion once every 2 weeks 
(total of 2 doses) at which level there were no life- threatening toxicities, mortality, and all 
findings were reversible. 
2.6. IMGC936 Dose Sele ction  
A dose of 0.5 mg/kg was estimated as the maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) for the 
proposed Phase [ADDRESS_575543] value of MRSD determined by [CONTACT_446917]: a 
traditional HNSTD -based approach (MRSD 1) and a PK -guided approach (MRSD 2). 
In brief, using the HNSTD- based approach ( CDER 2010) , the starting dose was determined as 
follows. The HNSTD in the GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was determined to be 10 mg/kg administered by 10-minute IV infusion every 2 weeks for 2 doses. MRSD
1 was 
defined as 1/6 the HNSTD (10 × 1/6 = 1.67 mg/kg). The human equivalent of MRSD 1, based on 
a body surface area conversion factor ( CDER 2014) , was calculated as 0.53 mg/kg ( ie, 1.67 
mg/kg × 0.32). IMGC936 has similar binding affinity (KD) to human and cynomolgus monkey ADAM9 of 1.1 and 1.8 nM, respectively. This slight difference in KD can be attributed to 
within -assay variability and, therefore, considered to be similar. Consequently, no further 
adjustment for affinity differential was undertaken. Thus, 0.53 mg/kg dose was considered as the 
MRSD1.  
The second approach for the determination of the starting dose was based on the PK guided approach (Krishnan and Anders en 1990, Mahmood 2009). The HNSTD in the GLP toxicology 
study in cynomolgus monkeys was determined to be 10 mg/kg and the corresponding predicted 
area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC
0-inf) after the administration of the first 10-
minute IV  infusion dose was 37,089 µg•h/mL. Using the mean predicted clearance of ADC 
(CL adc) of 0.[ZIP_CODE] L/h/kg in humans, the human equivalent dose producing the same area under

 Confidential and Proprietary  
 27  the curve (AUC) at the monkey HNSTD was estimated as 3.7 1 mg/kg (the product of the AUC 
in cynomolgus monkeys and the estimated CL adc in humans). To this, a safety factor of 6 was 
applied as described above resulting in an estimated MRSD2 of 0.62 mg/kg. 
The lower of the MRSD1 and MRSD2 values was 0.53 mg/kg. Therefore, 0.5 mg/kg was 
considered as the MRSD.  
The proposed clinical doses for IMGC936 selected for the Phase 1 clinical trial are 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 12 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks as an IV infusion. At the 12 mg/kg dose, the 
predicted first dose maximum concentration (C
max) and AUC for ADC in humans were 
approximately the same (1×) as the exposure at the HNSTD (10 mg/kg) in monkeys. 
2.6.1. Multiples of Monkey Exposure  
Allometric scaling, modeling, and simulations were used to estimate exposu re data (C max and 
AUC) in the human after the first dose of 0.5 to 12 mg/kg and compared to the mean cumulative 
exposure for the HNSTD in the cynomolgus monkey (10 mg/kg). In this estimation, predicted exposure parameters in a dosing interval of 3 weeks (504 hours) in humans after the first dose 
were compared to actual exposure parameters in a dosing interval of 2 weeks (336 hours) 
following administration of the second dose at the HNSTD (10 mg/kg). First-dose predicted exposure data suggested adequate multiples of monkey exposure for the proposed dose range 
(0.5 to 12 mg/kg) to be investigated in humans. Using exposure parameters for ADC, DM51, and 
total antibody (which includes conjugated and unconjugated antibody), the safety margins at the starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg in humans were 35-, 27- and 25-fold, respectively, based on C
max and 
64-, 22-, and 67-fold, respectively, and based on cumulative AUC as calculated using human (predicted) and monkey (actual) exposure parameters. Multiples of monkey exposure at the proposed top dose of 12 mg/kg were in the range of 0.3- to 1.4-fold.

4.1. Overall Study Design  and Plan  
This study i s a Phase 1 /2, first -in-human, open-label, dose- escalation and expansion study 
designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor 
activity of IMGC936. 
Participants with unresectable, relapsed or refractory, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, TNBC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer, or pancreatic cancer will be enrolled  globally in approximately 26 center s.  
Up to a maximum of 345 participants will be enrolled in the study if all expansi on cohorts are 
fully enrolled. 
Each cycle is 21 days  for Schedule A and 28 days for Schedule B. IMGC936 is administered via 
IV infusion at the assigned dose for each cohort. Infusion duration will vary depending on dose 
and participant tolerability.   
Parti cipants may continue on study drug until disease progression, AE requiring discontinuation, 
withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or other discontinuation criteria are met ( Section  5.4).  
Participants will be followed for safety throughout the study. Any participant who discontinues 
study drug should return to the study site for an end of treatment visit (EOTV). The visit should 
be performed within [ADDRESS_575544] dose level 
administered will be designated as the MAD.  
Up to  72 evaluable participants will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase of this study.  
Dose escalation  follows a conventional 3 + 3 design: successive cohorts of 3 to 6 participants 
each will be evaluated in sequential escalating doses of single-agent IMGC936 ( Table 2) . 
Each cycle is [ADDRESS_575545] administration of IMGC936 (Cycle 1) in 
participants at the first [ADDRESS_575546] 
been  enrolled in intermediate dose cohorts at doses of 5 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg.

Cohort 5  7.0 mg/kg 
Cohort 6  10.0 mg/kg 
Cohort 7  12.0 mg/kg 
Dose escalation will follow standard 3  + 3 design until an MTD or MAD is established. To 
support the selection of the RP2D, upon agreement between investigators and the sponsor, any 
dose level not exceeding the MTD may be expanded to a maximum of 15 participants for further 
evaluation of safety, PK, antitumor activity, to facilitate selection of the RP2D. Intermediate dose levels, not exceeding the MTD, may also be explored. 
Participants on Schedule A who are not able to complete the 21-day evaluation secondary to AEs 
considered unrelated to study drug or any other cause unrelated to study drug are considered 
unevaluable for safety and toxicity during the DLT evaluation period and may be replaced.  
Participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, AE requiring discontinuation, 
withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or other discontinuation criteria are met ( Section  5.4).  
If recommended  by [CONTACT_194447] , in conjunction with the Sponsor, based on 
emerging safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary antitumor activity of IMGC936, an alternate schedule (Schedule B) may be explored ( Appendix 2 - Time and Events Schedule (Schedule B - 
28 day Cycle). Each cycle is [ADDRESS_575547] 2 cycles . On all subsequent cycles (C ycle 3 and beyond), participant s will receive study 
drug on Days 1 and 8 of a 2 8-day cycle ( Table 3) . To potentially reduce ocular or other safety 
events that  may be driven by C
max (maximum drug concentration after infusion), PK modeling 
suggests a fractionated weekly schedule would allow reduction in C max while maintaining AUC 
exposure. To reduce participant  burden of an indefinite weekly schedule, starting from the third 
cycle, participants will only receive the study drug in the first 2 weeks in a 4- week cycle.  
The 3  + 3 dose escalation as described previously will apply to the alternate  schedule. The 
recommended starting dose of 2 mg/kg/dose (Cycles 1 and 2) and 3 mg/kg/dose (Cycle 3 and 
beyond) for Schedule B  in a 4 -week cycle is less than the non-fractionated total dose of 7 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks , which was administered in Cohort 5 of Schedule A.

considered unrelated to study drug or any other cause unrelated to study drug are considered

4.1.2. Expansion Cohorts 
The Dose Expansion Phase is designed to explore efficacy of IMGC936 at the RP2D as a single-
agent in study participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors.  
RP2D wi ll be selected by [CONTACT_128613]. Following determination of the RP2D, 
and at the sponsor’s discretion, up to 7 expansion cohorts may be opened in tumor types selected from those enrolled in dose escalation ( Table 4). Participants in Cohorts A through G can be 
enrolled in either in Dosing Schedule A or Schedule B upon sponsor’s discretion.

Cohort G Any one above-mentioned tumor with an alternate dose and/or schedule 
Abbreviations: CRC: colorectal cancer; TNBC: triple -negative breast cancer; NSCLC: non -small cell lung cancer.  
Participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, AE requiring discontinuation, 
withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or other discontinuation criteria are met ( Section  5.4).  
A futility assessment will be conducted on the first 13 participants ( Section 14.1)  in each 
expansion cohort. If there are at least [ADDRESS_575548] stage, an additional 26 participants may be recruited to that cohort ( full expansion) (for a

anti
tumor activity, and survival of participants who receive d IMGC936. 
The expans
ion cohorts may test more than 1 dose and/or schedule, not exceeding the MTD. 
Tumor types examined in Cohorts A to E may be further explored at a second dose and/or 
schedule in Cohorts F and G.  
Tumor specimens for determination of ADAM9 expression via IHC staining will be collected 
from all participants and will be assayed at a central laboratory designated by [CONTACT_456] (see 
Section
 10.3.1). ADAM9 testing results are not required for enrollment.

 34  Further, antitumor activity is  described in  Section 11.  
4.2. Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
For guiding dose- escalation decisions, DLTs will be defined based on TEAEs  or abnormal 
laboratory values that meet DLT criteria that occur up to Day 21 of Cycle 1 for Schedule A and 
Day 28 of Cycle 1 for Schedule B. AE severity will be graded according to National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). 
DLTs wil l be defined separately for hematologic, non-hematologic, and hepatic events. 
In addition to conventional Cycle 1 DLTs to guide escalation, cumulative toxicity and tolerability for all cohorts will be considered and may be utilized to inform dose escalation. 
4.2.1. Hematologic Dose- Limiting Toxicity  
Hematologic DLT is defined as follows: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days 
• ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, irrespective of duration 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significa nt bleeding 
• ≥ Grade 3 hemolysis 
The following events will be specifically excluded from the definition of hematologic DLT: 
• ≥ Grade 3 lymphopenia 
• Grade 3 anemia that is not associated with other clinically significant complications  
4.2.2. Non-hematologic Dose- Limiting Toxicity 
Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic event, including Grade 3 
ocular symptoms and signs. 
The following events will be specifically excluded from the definition of non-hematologic DLT: 
• Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality  that lasts < 72 hours, is not otherwise associated with 
clinical complications, and responds to medical intervention 
• Grade 3 fever that lasts < 72 hours and is not associated with hemodynamic 
compromise 
• Grade 3 nausea or vomiting that lasts < 72 hours and responds to medical intervention 
• Grade 3 or greater amylase and/or lipase elevation that is not associated with clinical or radiographic evidence of pancreatitis requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Grade 3 gastrointestinal AEs of diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dyspepsia, or dysphagia that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 72 hours with maximal supportive care 
• Grade 3 fatigue that lasts < 72 hours 
Note: The following Grade 2 non-hematologic AEs may also be considered as DLTs:

 35  • Grade 2 AEs that are prolonged inordinately, based upon the medical judgment of the 
investigator, and/or lead to permanent discontinuation of study drugs due to 
participant intolerance  
• Hepatic laboratory abnormalities meeting Hy’s law criteria (described within 
Section  4.2.3) 
• Eye pain or reduction in visual acuity that does not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_451363] 1 within 14 days of initiation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_451364], or that requires systemic treatment 
4.2.3. Hepatic Dose- Limiting Toxicity  
Hepatic DLTs will be defined as follows: 
• Any elevation of one or more transaminases > 8 × the institutional reference 
laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN) irrespective of duration 
• Any Grade 3 elevation of one or more transaminases > 5.0–8.0 × ULN that does not 
resolve to Grade 2 ( ie, > 3.0–5.0 × ULN) within 7 days and Grade 1 ( ie, 
> ULN– 3.0 × ULN) within 14 days. 
• Grade 3 el evation of total bilirubin that is > 5 × the ULN irrespective of duration  
• Any Grade 3 elevation of total bilirubin > 3.0–5.0 × ULN that does not resolve to Grade 2 ( ie, > 1.5–3.0 × ULN) within 7 days and Grade 1 ( ie, > ULN –1.5 × ULN) 
within 14 days. 
• Any event meeting criteria for Hy’s law as follows (all 3 features):  
− Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT ) > 3 × ULN  
− Concurrent elevation of total bilirubin > 2 × ULN without initial evidence of 
cholestasis  
− No alternative etiolog y can be identified  
4.3. Expansion  Phase  Safety Monitoring  
Safety will be evaluated continuously and in aggregate in the expansion cohorts. Safety 
assessments will be based on all TEAEs and abnormal laboratory values. If at any time ≥ 33% of at least 3  partici pants who received study drug in an expansion cohort experience a study drug–
related TEAE leading to discontinuation, enrollment will be paused within that cohort and may also be paused in ongoing cohorts at the discretion of the sponsor. If it is determined that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable pa rticipant risk, the study must be 
terminated after appropriate consultation between the sponso r and investigators.

 36  4.4. Dose Escalation Rules  
Dose escalation will use a conventional 3 + [ADDRESS_575550] 3 participants treated at a given dose level experiences a DLT, then 3 additional 
participants will be enrolled at that dose level to further assess the safety  of IMGC936. 
• If ≥ 1 of these 3 additional participants ( ie, ≥ 2 of the 6 participants) experience a 
DLT, it will be concluded that the MTD has been exceeded, and 3 participants will be enrolled and treated at the next lower dose level.  
• If 0 of the 3 additional participants (ie , ≤ 1 of the 6 participants) experience a DLT, 
then the dose will be escalated, and 3 participants will be enrolled at the next higher dose level.  
If ≥ [ADDRESS_575551] 3 participants treated at a given dose level, or ≥ 2 of 6 part icipants treated at a 
given dose level, experience a DLT, then it will be concluded that the MTD for IMGC936 has 
been exceeded at that dose level, and all subsequent participants will be treated at the next lower 
dose level.  
For participants being treated at a dose level subsequently determined to exceed the MTD for a 
given cohort of the study, the dose of IMGC936 will be reduced to the next lower dose level as 
summarized in Table 2. Following these rules for dose escalation, the MTD/MAD will be the 
highest dose administered at which the incidence of DLT is < 33%. 
Dose escalation to the next dose level is permitted only after the participants enrolled in th e 
current dose cohort have completed the DLT evaluation period and the safety data have been 
reviewed by [CONTACT_451404]. 
Evaluation of safety data from each cohort will include an assessment of the proportion of 
participants who receive planned doses, and the percentage of participants that require dose reductions or dose discontinuations for toxicity. All available data from participants both during 
and beyond the DLT evaluation period will be considered when making dose escalation 
decisions and in determination of the RP2D. 
At the discretion of the sponsor, dose escalation may be stopped before an MTD is reached. In 
this case, the MAD may be chosen based on an assessment of PK, safety, and response data. An 
MTD does not have to be reached to expand a dose cohort if the available data demonstrate that a lower dose level may provide antitumor activity while minimizing potential risk.  
At the discretion of the sponsor, any dose escalation cohort at a dose level not exceeding the MTD may be expanded to a maximum of 15 participants for further evaluation of safety, PK, antitumor activity, to facilitate selection of the RP2D. Intermediate dose levels, not exceeding the 
MTD, may also be explored. Followin g determination of the RP2D, tumor- specific expansion 
cohorts may be opened in tumor types selected from those enrolled in dose escalation.

Under no circumstances is the investigator allowed to release clinical study supplies for use by 
[CONTACT_451407] (Food and Drug Administration) 1572 (or equivalent 
form) or to administer study drug to patients not enrolled in this study. Study drug must be dispensed at an institution specified on Form FDA 1572 (or equivalent form). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. IMGC936 Dosage 
The calculated dose of IMGC936 will be administered based on the participant’s body weight at 
Cycle 1, Day 1. Body weight will be measured at screening and Day 1 of each cycle. Significant (≥ 10%) change in body weight from baseline should prompt recalculation of dose. Refer to the pharmacy manual for further instructions on allowable parameters for dose rounding. 
IMGC936 should not be administered as an IV push or bolus. All doses of IMGC936 will be 
diluted in D5W and administered as an IV infusion with a commercially available infusion 
pump. All infusion pumps must be calibrated in accordance with the institutional standards, 
policies, and procedures to ensure consistent, accurate delivery of IMGC936. 
Infusion or allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of mAb and other protein- based 
therapeutics. Precautions for anaphylaxis should be observed during administration. Refer to 
Section  7.[ADDRESS_575566] parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Return the vial if the solution is cloudy, there is pronounced discoloration (solution may have pale-yellow color), or there is foreign particulate matter.

MEASURES  
7.1. Infusion Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) (non -serious and serious) are adverse events of special interest 
(AESI) and must be reported using an SAE form per Section 12.2.2.  
The IRRs associated with administration of mAb -based therapeutics should be managed 
according to the standard practice of medicine. General guidelines for management of such 
reactions are provided in this section. However, severe reactions may require more intensive interventions ( eg, steroids) . 
Participants should be monitored closely for development of IRRs during infusions. Medications and supportive measures for treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions should be available 
for immediate use for an infusion reaction during study drug administration and may include, but 
are not limited to, subcutaneous epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (0.3 to 0.5 mL of a 1:1000 solution), antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV [or orally (PO) if IV not available]), corticosteroids ( eg, 
hydrocortisone 20 to 40 mg IV push or equivalent), IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, and antipyretics. Resuscitation equipment and other supplies for the emergency management of an allergic/toxic reaction must be available. The participant should be treated 
according to the best available local practices and procedures. All supportive measures consistent 
with optimal care will be provided throughout the study according to institutional standards. 
Should symptoms of fever, rigors, or chills develop, it may be difficult to distinguish among 
potential causes of the symptoms including emerging infection or infusion reaction. Participants 
should be evaluated carefully for the presence of infection (including COVID-19), with the acquisition of cultures and/or implementation of empi[INVESTIGATOR_451371]. Refer to Section  7.1.[ADDRESS_575571] blood drawn to further study the IRR, including determination of drug concentration and antibodies to IMGC936. Samples should be obtained within 3 hours of the onset of the reaction and again 1 week later.  
7.1.1. Grading and Management of Infusion Reactions 
Infusion reactions are graded per the criteria in  Table 6.

7.1.2. Premedication and Prophylaxis 
Premedication is required to mitigate the occurrence of infusion reactions. Equivalent 
medications may be substituted based on institutional standard of care and availability. Oral premedication should be given at least 30 minutes prior to infusion of study drug include:  
• Acetaminophen 650 to 1000 mg PO, or ibuprofen 400 mg PO 
• Diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV (or PO if IV is not available) or equivalent H1 
antagonist 
No prophylactic pre-infusion steroid administration is required. 
For subsequent study drug administration in a participant who had an IRR that was not 
adequately or only moderately controlled with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine, IV 
corticosteroids should be considered as part of the premedication regimen, (eg, 10 mg dexamethasone or equivalent. Nonsteroidal premedications may be administered prior to the subsequent infusion, if warranted. 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575572] be recorded. The following are treatment 
guidelines (which may be modified as needed by [CONTACT_451411]) for IRR. Note that for participants who have an infusion reaction requiring 
corticosteroid administration, corticosteroid administration should be used as prophylaxis on 
subsequent infusions. 
Grade 1:  
• Slow the infusion rate by 50%. 
• Monitor the participant for worsening of condition. 
• Continue rate at 50% reduction and increase dose rate to the original rate by [CONTACT_451412] 30 minutes, as tolerated to the initial rate. Consideration can be given to beginning subsequent infusions at 50% rate and increasing as tolerated. 
• If a parti cipant has an infusion reaction, prophylactic pre-infusion medications should 
be given prior to all subsequent infusions. The following prophylactic pre- infusion medications are recommended prior to future study drug infusions for participants who experience Grade 1 infusion reactions: diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg (or 
equivalent) IV (or PO if IV not available) and acetaminophen 650 mg PO and/or 
ibuprofen 400 mg PO, with or without famotidine 40 mg PO or 20 mg IV (or 
equivalent H2 antagonist) at least 30 minutes before additional study drug administrations.  
• Report the event as an AESI.  
Grade 2:  
• Stop the infusion. 
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 to 50 mg IV (or PO if IV not 
available).  
• Acetaminophen 650 mg PO or ibuprofen 400 mg PO for fever. 
• Oxygen and bronchodilators for mild bronchospasm. 
• Resume the infusion at 50% of the prior rate once the infusion reaction has resolved or decreased to Grade 1. The rate may then be escalated to the original rate after 30 minutes, as tolerated. Consideration can be given to beginning all subsequent infusions at 50% rate and increasing as tolerated. 
• Monitor for worsening condition. If symptoms recur, discontinue the infusion; no further study drug will be administered at that visit.  
• Prophylactic pre-infusion medications should be given prior to subsequent study drug infusions. Participants who experience a Grade 2 infusion reaction, for subsequent doses of study drug, pre medicate with diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 to 50 mg IV (or PO if IV is not available) , acetaminophen 650 mg PO and/or ibuprofen 400 mg

at least 30 minutes before additional study drug administrations. For these 
participants, corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg IV or hydrocortisone 25 to 100 mg IV or higher) also should be added to the premedication regimen for subsequent dosing of study drug. 
• Report the event as an AESI.  
Grade 3:  
• Stop the infusion and disconnect the infusion tubing from the participant. 
• To av oid exacerbation of infusion reaction: do not flush the tubing – aspi[INVESTIGATOR_451373]. 
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 to 50 mg IV (or PO if IV is not available), dexamethasone 20 mg IV (or equivalent), and other medications/treatment as medically indicated. Higher doses of corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg IV or the equivalent) may also be considered for acute management. 
• IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, and bronchodilators should be considere d, as 
appropriate. 
• If the Grade [ADDRESS_575573] resolved to baseline within 12 hours, study drug may be infused the next day. In addition, participants should be pre 
medicated for this re -challenge and for any subsequent doses of study drug with the 
following: diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 to 50 mg IV (or PO if IV is not 
available), acetaminophen 650 mg PO and/or ibuprofen 400 mg PO, with or without 
famotidine 40 mg PO or 20 mg IV (or equivalent H2 antagonist). Corticosteroids 
(dexamethasone 10 to 20 mg IV or hydrocortisone 50 to 100 mg IV or higher) should be considered as well.  
• Participants who have a Grade 3 infusion reaction that does not resolve within 
12 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_451374]. 
Participants who experience a second Grade 3 infusion reaction at the time of study drug re-challenge will permanently discontinue study drug. 
• Report the event as an AESI and as an SAE, if appropriate.

7.2. Ocular Toxicity
Maytansinoids are know n to cause ocular toxicity when used as the payload in ADCs. 
IMGC936-related ophthalmic findings were observed in repeat-dose nonc linical studies. These 
findings included reversible ocular events, eg, discharge , conjunctival swel ling, congestion 
and/or cloudiness, pannus, cellular or ke ratic precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263], and corneal pi[INVESTIGATOR_451376] .  
Ocular ev ents ha ve been observed i n patients re ceiving IMGC936 in clinical trials. As such, 
participants should be monitored for symptoms with each cycle and action taken as noted below 
both to monitor for and manage ocular toxicity should it arise. Ocular symptoms and signs to be 
closely monitored a re included but not limited to those defined in the IMGC936 Investigator’s 
Brochure, Section 6.6.2.  
For participants in dose esc alation cohorts in Schedule A, ocular symptom assessment should 
occur weekly during the first 3 cycles and subsequently on Day 1  of each cycle. F or participants 
in dose escalation cohorts in Schedule B, ocular symptom assessment should occur weekly in 
Cycle 1 and 2, and occur on Day 1 and Day 8 in each subsequent cycle. Pa rticipants ’ ocular

symptoms and signs. In certain circumstances, additional prophylactic eye drops may also be 
given, including the outlined options below. 
7.2.1. Eye Drop Options 
During this study, different eye drops will be tested to mitigate ocular events. Investigators and 
participants will be informed of which eye drop regimen(s) they should use before the start of 
study  treatment. P articipants a re required to r eceive  prophylactic lubr icating  artificial tears a nd 
may r eceive additiona l eye drop(s) as prophylaxis as recommended by [CONTACT_451413]. 
A formal voluntary ocular sub-study may be used to assign participants to diff erent eye drop 
regimens to compare the frequency and severity of ocular AEs (Section  4.1.3).  
Lubricating A rtificial  Tears 
All participants should be instructed to use lubricating a rtificial tears f or the tre atment and  
prophylaxis of ocul

9.9. Radiographic, CT, or MRI Assessments  
Tumor assessments are performed  according to the schedule in Appendix [ADDRESS_575597]/MRI scan with contrast, unless medically contraindicated, to document tumor burden. Subsequent tumor assessments on study should use 
the same imaging modality as that for the baseline assessment.  
Tumor assessments are performed  every 6 weeks  (Q6W ; ± 7 days) on Schedule A and every 8 
weeks (Q8W; ± 7 days)  on Schedule B while  on study drug then every 12 weeks ( Q12W ; ± 21 
days). Tumor assessments continue until discontinuation criteria are met. Tumor assessments are performed at EOTV except if prior assessment was ≤ [ADDRESS_575598] or MRI scan of the brain will be performe d when clinically indicated ( eg, history or 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_451383]) and repeat brain scans will be performed only if the screening brain scan was positive, or as clinically indicated.  
If feasible, participants who discontinue study drug for reasons other than PD ( eg, toxicity) 
should continue to undergo tumor assessments Q12W until evidence of PD, initiation of another 
anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, LTFU, death, or end of study whichever occurs first . 
9.10. Electrocardiography  
Twelve- lead ECGs  will be obtained according to the schedule in Appendix [ADDRESS_575599] three cycles, and at EOTV.  
To account for intrinsic variability, all ECGs should be obtained in triplicate (3 ECGs per time point at approximately 1- minute intervals). The actual time of the first of three ECGs per 
timepoint will be recorded as the actual time of the ECG.  
QTc > [ADDRESS_575600] appropriate for the participant , should be calculated.

An echocardiogram will be performed to evaluate LVEF at Screening and according to the 
schedule in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. Echocardiogram may be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion as clinically indicated .  
The Investigator can choose another appropriate modality  (eg, multigated acquisition scan 
[MUGA]) to assess LVEF.  
9.12. Ophthalmic Examination  
Ophthalmic examinations and ocular symptoms and signs assessments are performed according to the schedule in Appendix [ADDRESS_575601] and include the following: visual acuity (with/without corrective lens; whichever best reflects the participant’s usual functioning), slit -lamp e xamination, intraocular 
pressure measurement, and indirect fundoscopy. All participants will have a complete 
ophthalmic examination when ocular symptoms and signs develop, repeated as indicated in Table 7. Participants without ocular symptoms or signs will have ophthalmic exam ination s at the  
end of Cycle 2 and then approximately every 3 cycles  (ie, Cycle 5, 8, 11, etc. ) in both escalation 
and expansion pha ses. Participants with Grade [ADDRESS_575602] ophthalmic exam ination  at EOTV to document any subclinical findings . 
Ocular symptoms and signs assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_451420]. For participants reporting > Grade [ADDRESS_575603] for a complete examination 
(Section  7.2).  
Participants in th e ocular  sub-study will be monitored for the frequency and severity of ocular 
events as usual . Participants without ocular symptoms or signs should have an ophthalmic 
exami nation at the end of Cycle [ADDRESS_575604] an early  ocular examination after 2 cycles 
of therapy (instead of after 3 cycles) regardless of whether  they have ocular symptoms and signs. 
9.13. Archival Tumor Tissue  
Participants  must submit archival tumor tissue (FFPE block, or unstained slides) for analysis of 
ADAM9 expression. If a participant does not have archival material available for analysis, the 
participant may alternatively undergo a low- risk, medically routin e procedure to obtain a tissue 
sample, if appropriate. The decision to biopsy will be made once participant eligibility has been 
determined and on the basis of tumor accessibility and participant safety. This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_451384].

Blood and tissue samples will be collected per the schedules in Appendix 1, Appendix 2, 
Appendix 4, and Appendix 5. Studies to evaluate potential biomarkers of clinical and/or immunologic response to IMGC936 may  include the following analyses: 
•Correlation of ADAM9 expression and clinical response to IMGC936.
−Retrospective analysis of ADAM9 expression in tumor tissues for all pa rticipants .
•Baseline and on -treatment analysis of circulating soluble biomarkers ( eg, cell-free
tumor DNA and soluble ADAM9).
•Retrospective analysis of other potential predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers
including analysis of protein levels as well as gene expression and genomic analysesof DNA and RNA isolated from tumor samples.
•FcγR genotype will be determined retrospectively from peripheral blood mononuclearcells to evaluate the association  of FcγR genotype and clinical response.
10.3.1. ADAM9 Expression in Tumor Tissue  
ADAM9 expression can vary across and within solid tumor indications, but is highly expressed in non-squamous NSCLC, TNBC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer,  and pancreatic cancer  (Hicks 
2019) , (Ab 2021) . During the study, ADAM9  expression  in participant tumor tissue will be  
analyzed at a central labo ratory  and correlated with response to IMGC936.  
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575610] and/or MRI scans. Target and non- target lesions 
will be designated at screening and then evaluate d after every other cycle, ie , Q6W (± 7 days) on 
Schedule A and every 8 weeks (Q8W; ± 7 days) on Schedule B while on study drug ( Appendix 1 
and Appendix 2) . At each tumor assessment time point, the overall response status will be 
determined based on assessment of target and non target lesions as well as appearance of any 
new lesions.  
If feasible, participants who discontinue study drug for reasons other than PD ( eg, toxicity, 
participant request) should continue to undergo tumor assessments Q12W (±  21 days) until 
evidence of PD, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of study consent, LTFU, 
death, or end of study, whichever occurs first .  
• For RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 6) , the overall responses will be categorized as CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or NE. For participants who experience an objective response of CR or PR, 
responses will be considered unconfirmed until the response has been documented by a 
subsequent confirmatory scan obtained no less than 4 weeks after the initial scan 
demonstrating an objective response. 
 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575611] dose of study drug or 
until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first) and will be determined 
based on signs, symptoms, physical examination findings, and/or laboratory test results from enrolled participants, as appropriate. The investigator should follow and provide updates for all 
AEs until clinical recover y is complete, laboratory values return to normal, the participant  
stabilizes, or death occurs to ensure the safety of the participants . This may mean that 
observations continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_456].  
Protocol- related AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time the participant has consented to 
study participation. AEs and SAEs reported between the time participant consent is obtained and 
administration of the first dose of study drug will be captured as medical history unless the 
events are attributed to protocol-spe cified procedures that are not part of standard of care that 
occur during this time period, in which case the events will be collected on the AE CRFs. 
SAEs will continue to be followed by [CONTACT_388080], 
stabilization or retur n to baseline. Beyond the defined reporting period, any unsolicited SAE 
assessed as related to the study drug by [CONTACT_451421]. Additional information obtained after database lock will reside solely in 
the safety database.  
Progression of the underlying neoplasm resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] ( eg, participant 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451385], without any other SAE) will be documented as a PD outcome and not as an SAE. If an SAE occurs and it is unclear whether the event is related to 
disease progression, the SAE should be reported. 
12.1. Definitions  
12.1.1. Adverse Event  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial participant associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE  can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test 
abnormalities.  
12.1.2. Adverse Drug  Reaction  
An adverse drug reaction is a noxious and unintended response to the medicinal product related 
to any dose. As used herein, the phrase “response to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility.  
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575612] (AESI) is an event of scientific and medical interest or 
concern to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communicat ion to the sponsor could be appropriate. It may be a serious or non-serious AE, 
which may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it; refer to Section  12.2.3 for full details.  
12.1.4. Attribution/Assessment of Causality  
Attribution/assessment of causality is a determination that describes the relationship or association of the study product with an AE .  
This assessment of causality or relationship of AEs to the study drug is provided by [CONTACT_451422] 1) temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study drug; 2) whether an alternative etiology has been identified, and 3) biological plausibility. Causality must be assessed separately for each study drug. 
The causality assessment catego ries that will be used for this study are described below. 
Causality assessments that are considered not related to study drug: 
None:  The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the alternative etiology 
should be documented in the medica l record).  
Unlikely:  The event is unlikely to be related to the study drug and likely to be related to 
factors other than study drug. An alternative explanation is more likely ( eg, concomitant 
drugs, concomitant disease), or the relationship in time sugges ts that a causal relationship is 
unlikely. 
If an SAE is considered “unlikely” or “unrelated” to study drug, the investigator should offer 
their clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_305638](s), agent(s), or process(es) were the likely causative mechanism for the even t. 
Causality assessments that are considered related to study drug: 
Possible: There is an association between the event and the administration of the study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study drug; but there may 
also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the participant’s clinical status or 
underlying disease. 
Probable:  There is an association between the event and the administration of study drug; 
there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug and the event 
could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_143140]’s clinical status or an alternative etiology is not apparent. 
Definite:  There is an association between the event and the administration of st udy drug; 
there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug, causes other than 
the study drug is ruled out, and/or the event re- appeared on re-exposure to the study drug. 
12.1.5. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in an y of the following outcomes: 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-0901 Amendment 3 29 March  2022 
 
  
 Confidential and Proprietary  
 73  • Death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (excludes 23-hour hold for observation, admission 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451386], respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], outpatient surgery, social admission, or admission for elective/preplanned surgery)  
• Requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical events that ma y not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
12.1.6. Severity Criteria  
An assessment of severity grade will be made using NCI CTCAE v5.0. The CTCAE are 
published standardized definitions for AEs to describe the severity of laboratory and organ 
toxicity for patients receiving cancer therapy. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severity of events not directly experienced by [CONTACT_2299] ( eg, laboratory 
abnormalities).  
For events not contained in CTCAE, the investigator may assign intensity according to the following generic CTCAE grading scale: 
• Grad e 1 = Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2 = Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL ). 
• Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  
• Grade 4 = Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade 5 = Death related to AE.  
 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575613] one dose of study drug will be considered evaluable for 
safety. AEs will be determined based on signs, symptoms, physical examination findings, and/or 
laboratory test results from enrolled participants as appropriate. 
All AEs, whether serious or non- serious, will be reported from the time participant consent is 
obtained through the EOTV or [ADDRESS_575614] dose of study drug or until the start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first).  The investigator should follow and 
provide updates for all AEs until clinical recovery is complete, laboratory values return to normal, the participant  stabilizes, or death occurs to ensure the safety of the participants . 
Both protocol- related AEs and SAEs will  be collected from the time the participant has 
consented to study participation. AEs and SAEs reported between the time participant consent is 
obtained and administration of the first dose of study drug will be captured as concurrent medical 
history unless the events are attributed to protocol-specified procedures. Events attributed to protocol-specified procedures will be collected on the AE eCRFs and SAE report form as appropriate.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug, must be 
recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. All records will need to capture:  
• Duration, severity, and seriousness of each AE  
• Action taken with respect to the study drug 
• Investigator’s attribution/causality  assessment  
• Event outcome  
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common 
etiology ( eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as 
“upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). All treatm ent measures that are required for AE management 
must be recorded in the source document. The intensity (severity) of AEs will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v5.0 and serious events will be determined by [CONTACT_451423]  12.1.5 above.  
Clinical Laboratory Changes: Safety laboratory assessments will be evaluated by [CONTACT_451424]. Laboratory tests will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0. The investigator is responsible for reviewing the results of all laboratory tests as they become available:  
• Laboratory values that fall outside of a clinically accepted reference range or values that diff
er significantly fro m previous values must be evaluated by [CONTACT_451425]. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests.  
• A laboratory abnormality is reported as an AE if it is associated with an intervention. An intervention includes, but is not limited to, discontinuation of study drug, dose 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-0901 Amendment 3 29 March  2022 
 
  
 Confidential and Proprietary  
 75  reduction/delay, or concomitant therapy. In addition, any medical important 
laboratory abnormality may be reported as an AE at the discretion of the investigator. 
This includes laboratory abnormalities for which there are no interventions, but the abnormal value(s) suggests a disease or organ toxicity. If clinical sequelae are 
associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should 
be reported ( eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality ( eg, elevated 
creatinine, urine red blood cell increased).  
Section  12.2.5 summarizes AE reporting to sponsor timeframes. The sponsor assumes 
responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also notify the investigator of regulatory submissions, as appropriate. The investigator is responsible 
for notifying the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the protocol, unless otherwise required and 
documented by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB. 
For this study, the participants must be provided with a study card and instructed to carry this 
study card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: 
• Study number 
• Statement, in the local language(s), that the participant is enrolled in a clinical study  
• Investigator's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour contact [CONTACT_23828] 
• Site number 
• Participant number 
PD under study is an anticipated occurrence and is part of the efficacy objectives of this study. 
PD is not an AE. However, any medical event or condition that results from PD, if untoward, should be reported as an AE. 
12.2.2. Serious Adverse Events   
All SAEs occurring during the study must be reported to the sponsor. 
After [ADDRESS_575615] is related to study drug, the investigator should report the event to the sponsor.  
Within 24 hours of becoming aware of an SAE, the investigator should provide a completed SAE 
report form, via email or fax, to the sponsor. Upon receipt of follow-up information pertaining to an SAE, a follow-up SAE report form should be submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the follow -up information. All SAEs should be entered into the eCRFs within 
5 calendar days of the site’s awareness.  
The investigator must follow all SAEs until resolution and record the date of resolution. Resolution of an event is defined as the return to pre -treatment status or stabilization of the 
condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the participant from the study, must be followed until any of the following 
occurs:  
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-0901 Amendment 3 29 March  2022 
•The ev
ent resolves
•The event stabilizes
•The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
•It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (participant or
health care practi tioner refusal to provide additional information, LTFU after
demonstration of due diligence with follow- up efforts)
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) that occurs during enrollment in a study must be reported as an SAE, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]: 
•A standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451387]
•A procedure for protocol/disease- related investigations ( eg, surgery, scans,
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling, PK or biomarkerblood sampling)
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43717] (eg, social reasons such
as pending placement in long- term care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57714])
•Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the
eCRF)
PD should not be reported as an SAE term; however, any serious medical event/condition that 
results from progression of unde rlying disease, if untoward, should be reported as the SAE. The 
applicable protocol case report form page(s) pertaining to death should be appropriately 
completed, how ever, as disease progression. Death should not be reported as an SAE term. Death 
is an outcome of a specific SAE term. In exceptional case s, “death of unkn own ca use” may be 
used as an event term until the cause of death has been determine d. If an autopsy was perfo rmed, 
the autopsy report should be provided.  
12.2.3. Protocol- S pecific Adverse Events o f Sp ecial  Interest 
IM
GC936 has 1 AESI: IRR. Any symptom or sign occurring within 24 hours of infusion and 
suggestive of an IRR should be promptly reported as per Section 12.2.5.  
Further information on risks can be found in the IMGC936 Investigator’s Brochure. 
12.2.4. Pregnancy 
A
ll reports of pregnanc y in participants or partn ers of male participants must be reported to the 
sponsor by [CONTACT_3449]-site personnel within 24 hours of their know ledge of the event using the 
Pregnancy Exposure Form. Abnormal pregnanc y outcomes (eg, spontane ous abortion, fetal 
death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and must be 
reported using the SAE report form. Any participant who becomes pregnant during the study 
must discontinue further study drug administration. 
Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknow n, pregnancies in partners of male 
pa
rticipants included in the study will be reporte d by [CONTACT_1758]-site pers onnel within 24 hours of

Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575618] quality complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect related to 
manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, quality, 
durability, or reliability of a product, including its labeling or package integrity. A PQC may 
have an impact on participant safety and activity of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete 
reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of 
participants, investigators, and the sponsor and are mandated by [CONTACT_67819]. The sponsor has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to 
ensure appropriate r eporting of PQC information; all studies conducted by [CONTACT_443743].  
13.1. Procedure  
All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_1758]-site personnel, after being made 
aware of the event, and those that are associated with clinical consequences must be reported within [ADDRESS_575619] report the PQC to the 
sponsor according to the SAE reporting timelines (refer to Section  12.2.2, Serious Adverse 
Events). A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for further investigation if requested by [CONTACT_456].

 79  14. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
This section outlines the statistical methodology and principles which will be used for data 
analysis in this study. A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will further describe the details 
regarding statistical methods and will gove rn the analysis. 
14.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The number of participants who receive study drug cannot be determined precisely in advance. The study plans to treat up to approximately 72 participants in dose escalation. The sample size 
is based on a 3 + 3 design with 7 planned dose cohorts of IMGC936. Additional participants may 
be enrolled if a dose cohort is expanded, participants are replaced, or intermediate dose levels are evaluated.  
Each expansion cohort may be expanded independently following an opt imal Simon’s 2- stage 
design. The null hypothe sis is that an uninteresting response rate is  9% less . The design has 80% 
power to detect a target response rate of 25% at the significance level of 1-sided 0.05. Following 
this design per cohort, the first stage of the futility assessment  will be conducted in the first [ADDRESS_575620] 7  responders out of a total of 39 response- evaluable p articipants , the 
null hypothesis will be rejected for that cohort.  
14.2. Analysis Populations  
The study analyses will be performed on the following populations: 
• Safety Population: All participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This 
population will be used for analyses of safety, PK, and immunogenicity. It will also be used for summary of baseline data and analyses of PFS. 
• Response Evaluable Population: All participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had base line measurable or non -measurable disease, and had at least one 
post-baseline radiographic tumor assessment or discontinued study drug due to clinical progression or death if no post-baseline tumor assessment. This population will be used for summary of tumor assessment data and analyses of response rates.  
14.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Participant disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, disease history, medical history, and prior cancer treatment will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
14.4. Study Drug Exposures and Concomitant Medications  
Study drug exposures and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. The summary of study drug exposure will include descriptive statistics as well as frequency 
counts for the number of doses or cycles received, the total dose administered as well as the total 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc

 80  dose intended, and the dose intensity, which is calculated as percentage of total dose actually 
administered divided by [CONTACT_451428]. 
14.5. Safety Endpoints and Analyses  
14.5.1. Adverse Events  
Only treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized in tables. The following AEs will be provided in summary tables as well as displayed in listings:  
• All AEs  
• AEs with CTCAE severity Grade ≥ 3 
• Ocular  AEs  
• Study drug related AEs 
• Study drug related AEs with CTCAE severity Grade ≥ 3 
• SAEs  
• Study drug related SAEs 
• AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug 
• AEs resulting in interruption of study drug 
• Study drug related AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug 
• Study drug related AEs resulting in interruption of study drug 
• Fatal AEs  
• AESIs  
All of these tables will display the number and percent of participants that experience the given 
event and will display events by [CONTACT_10607]  (MedDRA ) 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Events will be displayed alphabetically for 
SOC and in descending order of overall PT incidence within each SOC. An overall summary of 
AEs will display the number and percent of participants who experience at least one event of 
each of the above types.  
14.5.2. Laboratory Values  
Summaries of laboratory values will display descriptive statistics for numerically quantified 
laboratory test results. Summaries will be grouped by [CONTACT_16416] ( eg, hematology, blood 
chemistry, and urinalysis) and will be displayed by [CONTACT_451429].  
14.5.3. Other Safety Endpoints  
Twelve lead ECGs will be collected and analyzed for evidence of cardiac toxicity, especially 
prolongation of QT interval. Change in LVEF from baseline will be summarized. Vital signs will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics at each visit and time point at which they are collected. Shift tables may be created.

 81  14.6. Pharmacokinetic Biomarker  Analysis  
14.6.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Study drug concentrations will be summarized. Summary statistics will be tabulated separately 
for PK parameters by [CONTACT_451430]936 dose. Geometric means and percent coefficients of variation 
will be reported for C max, AUC from time zero to time t (AUC 0-t), AUC 0-inf, trough concentration 
(Ctrough) and accumulation index (AI); arithmetic means and standard deviations will be reported 
for half- life (t 1/2), clearance (CL), and volume of distribution at steady state (V ss); and medians, 
minimum,  and maximum will be reported for time to maximum concentration ( Tmax). Separate 
scatter plots of C max and AUC may be provided versus dose to assess dose dependency. Dose 
proportionality may be assessed using a power model. 
14.6.2. Immunogenicity Analysis  
The proportion of participants who are negative for ADAs at baseline and become positive in 
this assay, the proportion of participants who are negative at baseline and remain negative, and 
those who have positive ADA at baseline that increases or decreases in titer over the course of 
the study will be summarized.  
14.6.3. Biomarker Analysis  
Summary statistics for biomarker parameters, such as, but not limited to, those listed in 
Section  10.3 and corresponding changes from baseline will be summarized and/or may also be 
presented graphically. Biomarker analysis and subsequent results may be reported in separate 
documents and not included in the SAP or clinical study report, respectively. 
14.7. Efficacy and Endpoint Analyses  
14.7.1. Response Endpoints and Analyses  
For RECIST v1.1, the best overall response (BOR) will be categorized as CR, PR, SD, PD, or 
NE. To be qualified as BOR, CR and PR require confirmation at least 28 days (4 weeks ) after 
initial observation of such response, and SD requires to be observed at least once after 35 days 
(6 weeks [- 1 week])  from the first dose of study drug.  
The number and percent of participants with their BOR will be summarized . Objective response 
rate per RECIST v1.1 is estimated as the proportion of participants in the Response Evaluable Population who achieve BOR of CR or PR. Two-sided 95% exact binomial CIs of the response rates will be calculated.  
14.7.2. Analysis of Tumor Size Change Over Time  
The tumor size is defined as the sum of diameters of the target lesions. The tumor size percent 
change from baseline over time will be summarized and will be presented by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_203825]. The best tumor size percent change from baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_451431].

or prior to initiation of such 
treatment  Censored  
Death or documented 
progression immediately after missing [ADDRESS_575622] tumor assessment 
prior to missed assessments  Censored  
Abbreviation: PFS: progression- free survival  
DoR is defined as the time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first 
documented progression or de ath from any cause, whichever occurs first. The DoR is calculated 
only for the responders. For responders who are not known to be dead or progressed at the time of data cut -off for DoR analysis, the DoR will be censored at the date of the last tumor 
assessment. Specifically, the last 3 situations described in Table 11 will be applied. DoR 
analyses will be performed only if there are enough responders to render the analyses meaningful. 
The Kaplan -Meier method will be applied to estimate PFS  and DoR curves; their median times, 
and PFS rates at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (3) will 
be used to construct 95% CIs for median time of each time -to-event endpoint. The 95% CIs for 
PFS rates at each time point of interest will be calculated by [CONTACT_451432](-log) transformation.

Quality review activities will be undertaken to e nsure accurate, complete, and reliable data. The 
sponsor and/or its representatives will do the following: 
• Provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate. 
• Sponsor a start-up training session to instruct investigators and study coordinators. 
This session will give instruction on the protocol, completion of eCRFs, and study 
procedures. 
• Monitor protocol and GCP compliance on a regular basis (on- site visits and/or remote 
monitoring). 
• Be available for consultation and stay in contact [CONTACT_86203], e mail, telephone, and/or fax. 
• Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer checks to detect and query errors in data collection. 
• Conduct a quality review of the database. 
15.1. Monitoring, Auditing and Inspections  
The sponsor or its designee will monitor the conduct of the trial on a regular basis throughout the 
duration of the study, according to the monitoring plan and in compliance with current GCP 
guidelines. Monitoring of the study will serve to ensure: (a) The rights and well -being of human 
subjects are protected; (b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from 
source documentation; and (c) The conduct of the trial complies with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
The study monitor will educate site personnel on the conduct of the trial. The monitor will assess 
the trial site’s compliance with the protocol and will periodically review and verify a sample of 
the participant data recorded on eCRFs against source documentation. The study monitor will 
also review documents that provide evidence of proper consent and eligibility of enrolled 
participants, compliant conduct of study procedures, administration and disposition of 
investigational product(s), reporting of SAEs and AEs, and continued maintenance of trial records.  
The investigator will allocate adequate time to support such monitoring activities. The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor is given re asonable access to study -related 
documents, source documents (regardless of media) and study- related facilities (eg , 
investigational pharmacy, etc.). Queries may be raised if any datum is unclear or contradictory. The Investigator and site personnel must a ddress all queries in a timely manner.  
Sponsor personnel and the designee ( ie, representative from the contract research organization) 
will review the protocol and clinical trial database with the investigator and the site staff at a site initiation visit.  Monitoring procedures that comply with current GCP guidelines will be followed. 
On-site and/or remote monitoring will be performed by a representative of the sponsor (clinical 
study monitor). Review of the clinical trial database for completeness and clar ity, cross- checking 
with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed. During 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575623] maintain source documents for each participant in the study, consisting of 
(but not limited to) all visit notes, laboratory data, ECGs, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. The investigator must also keep the original signed informed consent form (ICF); a signed copy is given to the participant. The investigator must give the monitor access to all 
relevant source documents to confirm t heir consistency with clinical trial database entries. Full 
verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
documentation of SAEs is required. Additional checks of the consistency of source data with the clinical trial database are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of the potential for inspection by [CONTACT_4530]/representatives, US or non-US government regulatory authorities, IRB/IEC, 
and applicable compliance and quality assurance offices. The investigator will permit study-
related audits and inspections and will provide access to all study- related documents (eg , source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data). The investigator will 
ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study related facilities ( eg, pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory). 
15.2. Data Collection and Management  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up- to-date records for 
each participant. The investigator is also responsible for maintaining any source documentation 
related to the study, including any films, tracings, or other media containing data pertaining to this protocol. 
The anonymity of participants must be maintained. For data collection, and management 
purposes, participants are to be identified by [CONTACT_61212]. Documents that identify 
the participant beyond participant number ( eg, participant initials) will not be submitted to the 
sponsor ( eg, the signed informed consent document) and must be maintained in strict confidence 
by [CONTACT_093], except to the extent to allow auditing by [CONTACT_50756], study monitor, or sponsor representatives. 
Site person nel record all data for each participant through eCRFs using an EDC system provided 
and approved by [CONTACT_456]. Study sites must complete eCRFs for each participant in a timely 
manner shortly after each participant visit. As the person ultimately responsi ble for the accuracy 
of all eCRF data, the investigator must sign the Investigator’s Statement in each participant’s eCRF.  
The EDC system automatically generates queries resulting from the computer checks embedded 
into the system to ensure data accuracy, quality, consistency, and completeness. Manual queries 
resulting from review by [CONTACT_53194], medical coders, and Data Management staff are also generated from within the EDC system, where they are tracked. Study sites resolve the queries 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575624] the entered data accordingly. Every change to data is captured in the EDC system 
audit trail. Adverse events are coded using MedDRA, whereas concomitant medications are 
coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. Upon completion of the study, or after reaching a pre-specified point in the study, Data Management will lock the 
database and generate the SAS datasets necessary for analysis and reporting. Upon completion of 
the study, each study site will be provided with the eCRFs for each of their participants.

The investigator should provide the sponsor with a statement of compliance from the IRB/IEC 
indicating compliance with the applicable regulations in the region and International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Any 
documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities, such as the protocol and any amendments, Investigator’ s Brochure, and information concerning participant recruitment, 
payment or compensation procedures, or information from the sponsor will be submitted to the IRB/IEC. The IRB/IEC’s written approval of the study protocol and the ICFs will be in the possessio n of the investigator and the sponsor before the study drug is initiated at the 
investigator’s site. The investigator will transmit the IRB/IEC’s approval statement to the sponsor. This approval must include the date of review and refer to the study by [CONTACT_451433]/or study number and version number and refer to the ICFs by [CONTACT_451434]. If the 
IRB/IEC or institution uses its own unique number for the protocol instead of the sponsor’s 
number, that unique number should be noted on the approval statement. If approval of the ICFs is stamped on the forms (instead of documented in the IRB/IEC approval statement), the date of approval and/or expi[INVESTIGATOR_451388]. 
Protocol modifications or changes may not be initiated without approval from the sponsor and 
prior written IRB/IEC approval (when required), except when necessary to eliminate immediate 
hazards to the participant. Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC; and written 
verification that the modification was submitted should be obtained. 
The investigator must, where required by [CONTACT_427], submit the following to the IRB/IEC: 
•The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, and any amendments or updates.
•The informed consent form(s) and any amendments or changes.
•Any documents given to participants or potential participants ( eg, recruitment
materials, diary cards) and the plan for distribution/use.
•Revisions of other documents originally submitted for review or for notification.
•Serious and/or unexpected AEs occurring during the study.
•New information that may adversely affect the safety of participants or conduct of the
study.
•At minimum, an annual update and/or request for re-approval of study, unlessotherwise specified by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC.
•Protocol deviations.
•Notification when the study has been completed.
•Proof of indemnity/liability insurance.

1
. M easurability o f Tumor at B aseline
1.1  Defin
itions
At baseline
, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows: 
1.1.1  Measurable 
Tumor les
ions: Must be  accurately m easured in at least one dimension ( longest diameter in the  
plane of  measurement  is to be recorded)  with a minimum size of: 
•[ADDRESS_575650] sca
n (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions which cannot be
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable).
•[ADDRESS_575651] X- ray.
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥ [ADDRESS_575652] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short  axis will be measured 
and followed. See also notes below on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non- target lesions’ 
for information on lymph node measurement.  
1.1.2  Non-measurable  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable include leptome ningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_150063]. 
1.1.3  Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require comment: 
Bone lesions: 
•Bone scan, positron emission tomography scan or plain films are not considered
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques canbe used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blast ic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_451447].
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-0901 Amendment 3  29 March 2022 
 
  
 Confidential and Proprietary  
 107  • Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion prior to study enrollment. 
1.2  Specifications by [CONTACT_129918]  
1.2.1  Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
1.2.2  Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesions(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_338573], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X- ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. 
CT, M RI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_575653] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg , for body scans).

 Confidential and Proprietary  
 108  Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review later and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be t aken from one assessment to the next. If new 
lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. 
Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. 
2.   Tumor Response Evaluation  
2.[ADDRESS_575654] one measurable lesion (as detailed above).  
2.2  Baseline Documentation of ‘Target’ and ‘Non -target’ Lesions  
Where more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesi ons up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and will be recorded and measured at baseline. For 
example, in instances where participants have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded). Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . It 
may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesions which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected. 
Lymph nodes  merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. As noted above, pathological nodes which are 
defined as measurable and may be iden tified as target lesions must meet criterion of a short axis 
of ≥ [ADDRESS_575655] in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but 
< 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.

 109  A sum of the diameters  (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions  and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesion s involving the same organ as a 
single item on the case record form ( eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver 
metastases’).  
2.3  Response Criteria  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions. 
2.3.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
Partial R esponse (PR) : at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest s um on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ( Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression). 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
2.3.[ADDRESS_575656] the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_575657] achieve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual 
short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. 
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’ . While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-
nodal) recorded at baseline should have the ir actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small ( eg, 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes 
which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist 
may not feel comforta ble assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to 
measure’. When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it 
IMGC936 ImmunoGen, Inc  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMGC936-[ADDRESS_575658] that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned ( Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be 
used for lymph nodes since they usually hav e a definable size when normal and are frequently 
surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_575659] slice thickness (but 
should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is 
potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. However, if the radiologist can provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment . When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesions. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
2.3.3  Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may be measurable, they need not be 
measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively  at the time points specified in the 
protocol. 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 
Non- CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesions(s).  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-
target lesions. ( Note : the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
2.3.4  Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-target Disease  
The concept of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as follows:  
When a participant also has measurable disease . In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression; on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non- target lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for 
unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non- target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare. 
When the participant has only non-measurable disease . The same general concepts apply here as 
noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-

 111  target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly non- measurable) a 
useful test that can be applied when assessing participants for unequivocal progression is to 
consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non- measurable disease 
is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable 
disease: ie,  an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ 
(which is equivalent to a 20% i ncrease diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an 
increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in 
therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the participant should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-
measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it imposs ible to do so; therefore, the 
increase must be substantial.  
2.3.5  New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: ie,  not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is 
particularly important when the participant’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. 
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the participant who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT  or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals brain metastases. The participant’s brain metastases are considered to be 
evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation. The participant’s BOR 
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non- target disease and will also take 
into consideration the appearance of new lesions.

 112  2.4.2  Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation  
When  no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the participant is NE at 
that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements is made at an assessment, usually the 
case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing ar gument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point 
response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a participant 
had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_575662] Overall Response: All Time Points  
The best overall r esponse  is determined once all the data for the participant is known.

Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS 
required : Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the objective response is 
confirmed on a follow-up scan obtained no less than 4 weeks after the initial scan demonstrating 
an objective response. In this circumstance, the BOR can be interpreted as in  Table A -2.

a If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum durat ion for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the participant had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.  
Special Notes on Response Assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that participants with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the eCRF. 
Participants  with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of study drug 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
‘symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of study drug. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743]. The objective response status of such participants is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease as shown in Table A-1 and Table A -2. 
For equivocal findings of progression ( eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes 
or necrosis in existing lesions), study drug may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If 
at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.

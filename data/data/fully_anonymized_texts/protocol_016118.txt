PHASE  II

AND SIGNIFICANCE Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is th e most common malignant lesion 
of the kidney, with an estimated an nual incidence in the U.S. of

inhibitors (TKIs) sunitinib or pazopanib. Additional agents for second-line therapy have includ ed alternative VEGFR TKIs (e.g. 
axitinib), the mTOR inhibitor ever olimus as well as agents active 
against multiple tyrosine kinases. Recently both nivolumab an anti-
PD1 based immunotherapy (see belo w) and cabozantinib a TKI 
targeting both VEGFR and Met, have  shown OS benefits relative to 
mTOR inhibition in patients with prior VEGRF TKI therapy 
resulting in their FDA approval.   Nivolumab in the treatme nt of RCC. Preclincal and clinical studies 
have identified critic al mechanisms by [CONTACT_344747] (referred to as 
“checkpoints”) to block the initiat ion, delivery, or activation of 
effective anti-tumor surveillance. These insights have led to the development of a new class of i mmunotherapeutics referred to as 
“checkpoint inhibitors,” which in clude nivolumab, a human IgG4 
monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed death receptor-1 
(PD-1) and blocks its interacti on with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing

demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to everol imus, with a median survival of 
25.0 vs. 19.6 months (hazard ratio 0.73, p<0.002) and confirmed objective response rates of 21.5%  vs 3.9%, respectively.  In

treatment naïve patients. However, currently there is very limited 
single agent data on the activity of  nivolumab in treatment naïve 
patients with ccRCC. The BMS-sponsored study CA 209009 included 23 subjects with treatment -naïve RCC. In these patients, 
treatment with nivolumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks resulted in an 
overall response rate of 13% (3/23).

propose to conduct a study of nivol umab monotherapy in treatment 
naïve patients with advanced cc or nccRCC (Part A), with the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344668] 48 weeks into therapy (Part B) that will 
focus on uncovering biomarkers of re sponse and resistance to PD-1 
blockade, as well as possible predic tors of subsequent response to 
CTLA-4 blockade.  In this trial, we examine the following questions: 
1) How active is PD-1 blockade in  treatment naïve kidney cancer?  
2) What factors, in addition to PD-L1 expression, can reliably 
predict durable response?  3) Do gene expression signature s which are likely capturing the 
presence, magnitude, and activity of adaptive immune infiltrates 
reliably predict durable response?  4) Is there a threshold for PD-L1 expression in either the tumor or 
immune cell infiltrate that accurate ly predicts durable response?  
5) Is PD-L1 expression uniform a nd stable in an individual tumor 
and between a primary tumo r and its metastases?  
6) What are the mechanisms of i nnate resistance to PD-[ADDRESS_428072]

OBJECTIVES Primary Objective: 
Determine the PFS rate at 1 year of nivolumab in patients with 
treatment naïve ccRCC based on tumor PD-L1 expression. 
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 Determine the PFS rate at [ADDRESS_428073] of nivolumab in pa tients with treatment naïve 
ccRCC based on the PD1- Blockade Durable Response Predictive (PRP) biomarker model developed in the DFHCC Kidney Cancer SPORE 
 Determine the objective res ponse rate (CR/PR=ORR), the 
ORR based on PDL1 expressi on and the PRP model, and 
duration of response for nivolumab in patients with treatment naïve ccRCC 
 Determine the response rate of combined nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344669] (or lack 
of response at 1 year) 
 Determine the clinical activ ity (CR, PR and SD) and PFS 
rate at 1 year of nivolumab in  patients with treatment naive 
nccRCC 
 Assess the toxicity of nivol umab monotherapy in patients 
with treatment naïve cc or nccRCC 
 Correlative Objectives: 
 Explore novel potentia l predictive biomarke rs for patients 
with treatment naïve ccRCC and nccRCC 
 Explore the mechanisms  of innate and acquired resistance to 
nivolumab therapy in treatment  naïve patients with ccRCC 
 Identify biomarkers associated  with response to nivolumab

STUDY DESIGN The study will be a prospective Phase II trial of nivolumab in 134 
treatment naïve patients with clear cell (cc)RCC and 40 treatment 
naïve patients with non-clear cell (ncc)RCC. Eligible patients with 
tumor tissue available will receive nivolumab [ADDRESS_428074] defined

confirmatory scan will be evalua ted for enrollment on Part B of 
this study.  Patients without confir med PD can continue nivolumab 
therapy.  Patients with symptoma tic and radiographic PD will not 
require a confirmatory scan before proceeding to Part B of this study. Adverse events will be recorded continuously.  Patients who experience symptoma tic or confirmed PD (or have 
best response of SD at 48 week s) on nivolumab monotherapy will 
be eligible for consideration for Part B (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab re-
induction). Part B involves the addi tion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344670] 4 
doses while maintaining nivolumab  therapy. Dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344671] 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks together with nivolumab changed to 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses (must complete by 
[CONTACT_5875] 16). Nivolumab will revert to 360 mg every 3 weeks for 12 weeks followed by [CONTACT_20382] 480 mg IV every 4 weeks after the completion of treatment with ip ilimumab (beginning week 13-19 
of Part B).  Patients will continue to be fo llowed with serial 
imaging assessments 12, 18 and 24 weeks after the initiation of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Part B) and then every 12 weeks.  The tumor 
measurements at the time of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344672].  If unequivocal sympto matic or confirmed new PD (as 
defined above) develops, treatment will be discontinued.  Patients for Part B must still meet the elig ibility criteria for initial study 
enrollment.  Patients with Gr ade 3 toxicity on nivolumab 
monotherapy, (excluding endocrine toxicity), serious symptomatic 
disease that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_344673]/CR will be excluded from enrolling in Part B.  It is estimated 
that roughly half of th e patients accrued to th e first line treatment 
will go on to enroll in Part B. 
 
KEY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (See Section 3 for full eligibility criteria) Part A

will be associated with significan tly improved 1-year PFS rate for 
patients treated with PD-1 bloc kade (55% vs 13% taken as a 
binomial quantity). Consideri ng the four groups of PD-L1 
expression (0%, 1-5%, 5-20%, >20%),  and with an expected patient 
allocation within groups of (45%, 25%, 15%, 15%), the Cochran-Armitage test gives at least 90% po wer to detect a trend in 1-year

higher 1-year PFS between 48 positive patients and 72 negative patients (via Fisher’s exact test and assuming a difference in PFS of 
46% vs 17%). All testing above will be done at 1-sided α = 0.025. 
The specific distributional breakdowns are unknown but the power is relatively robust. For example,  if the split be tween positive and

group of histologies) will also be enro lled in the trial, at an accrual 
rate that is expected to be 33% th at of clear cell patients. Therefore, 
an expected cohort of 40 nccRCC patients will be enrolled in the 
trial and analyzed separately fo r evidence of anti-tumor activity, 
principally focusing on overall resp onse rate (CR or PR). With 40 
patients, the 95% confidence interv al on the true objective response

 Clear cell patients who reach best response of SD at 48 weeks or 
who experience progression will be offered the opportunity to enroll in the second component of the study, Part B, continued 
treatment with the addition of ip ilimumab. The primary endpoint of 
this portion of the trial will be ob jective response (CR or PR) taking

study.  An estimated [ADDRESS_428088] 14 patients that  response rate will be deemed 
uninteresting. If any confirmed re sponses are seen, accrual of 
nccRCC patients will continue for al l eligible patients completing 
Part A.    
ACCRUAL GOALS With multicenter accrual of 6-7 patients per month, the study 
should accrue 134 ccRCC patients (original 120 plus an additional 14 to provide paired baseline and resistant samples) 
to Part A in 2 years with an a dditional 1 year of follow-up time 
for Part A (1.5 years for Part B).  
 
The cohort of 40 nccRCC patients will be enrolled and analyzed separately for evidence of anti-t umor activity (CR, PR and SD 
and PFS at 1 year of nivolumab). These patients will also be eligible for participation in Pa rt B.  We anticipate that the 
accrual of these 40 patients will be able to be completed within the 1.5 
years needed for accrual of the ccRCC patients.

The global incidence of RCC exceeds 300,000 worldw ide with nearly 150,000 deaths annually 
with worsening mortality trends in the develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_344674].[1] In the US, the American Cancer Society’ s most recent estimates 
for kidney cancer for 2016 include approxi mately 62,700 new cases (39,650 in men and 23,050 
in women) and about 14,240 deaths (9,240 men a nd 5,000 women) from the disease [2]. In the 
US, RCC is the 10th most common cancer with a 1.6%  (1 in 63) lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_344675]. Metastatic disease is the proximate cau se of death for most patients and can present 
equally as either de novo advanced RCC or as re lapse following surgery fo r early stage disease. 
Decrements in life expectancy due to RCC have been estimated to  be about [ADDRESS_428092] [3]. 
Kidney cancer has a propensity to hematogene ously metastasize to any possible location, 
propagate tumor thrombus thr ough the inferior vena cava into the heart, and due to the 
hypervascularity of the tumor is  susceptible to tumo r hemorrhage, causing additional morbidity 
and extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344676].  Several distinct  subtypes of RCC have been 
identified, including: clear cell cancer, compri sing the majority of tumors and papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], 
chromophobe collecting duct and unc lassified tumors representi ng 15-25% of all tumors.  
 1.1.1 Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma 
Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) represent 75-85% of all RCC.  They typi[INVESTIGATOR_344677]. Ma croscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], they may be solid  or less commonly, cystic. In

composed of sheets of cells that  are darker than ccRCC (Thoenes). They lack the abundant lipid 
and glycogen that is characteristic of most RCCs, and originate from the inte rcalated cells of the 
collecting system. Chromophobe ca rcinomas may have a lower ri sk of disease progression and

 1.3 Nivolumab +/- Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344681] (also referred to as BMS-936558 or  MDX1106) is a human monoclonal antibody 
(HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that  targets the program med death-1 (PD-1) 
cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surf ace membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative 
regulatory molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes [7]. Binding of PD-1 to its 
ligands, programmed death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes 
immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell respons es to both foreign antigens as well as self-
antigens. Nivolumab is expresse d in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cells and is produced using 
standard mammalian cell cultiva tion and chromatographic purificat ion technologies. The clinical 
study product is a sterile solu tion for parenteral administra tion.  OPDIVO (nivolumab) is 
approved for use in multiple coun tries including the [LOCATION_002]  (US, Dec-2014), the European 
Union (EU, Jun-2015), and Japan (Jul-2014).  1.3.1 Non-Clinical Studies  Nivolumab has been shown to bind specifically to  the human PD-1 receptor and not to related 
members of the CD28 family [8, 9]. Nivolumab inhibits the interac tion of PD-1 with its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in enhanced T-ce ll proliferation and in terferon-gamma (IFN- γ) 
release in vitro [9-11]. Nivolumab binds with high  affinity to activated human T-cells expressing 
cell surface PD-1 and to cynomol gus monkey PD-1.  In a mixe d lymphocyte reaction (MLR), 
nivolumab promoted a reproducible concen tration-dependent enhancement of IFN- γ release [12] 
In intravenous (IV) repeat-dose toxicology studie s in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was well 
tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/ kg, administered weekly for 5 week s, and at doses up to 50 mg/kg, 
administered twice weekly for 27 doses. Wh ile nivolumab alone wa s well tolerated in

Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page [ADDRESS_428096] highlighted the pot ential for enhanced toxicity 
when combined with other immunostimulatory ag ents [13]. In addition, an enhanced pre- and 
postnatal development (ePPND) study in pregna nt cynomolgus monkeys with nivolumab was 
conducted [14]. Administration of nivolumab at up to 50 mg/kg 2QW was well tolerated by 
[CONTACT_162621]; however, nivolu mab was determined to be a selective developmental toxicant 
when administered from the peri od of organogenesis to parturiti on at > 10 mg/kg). Specifically, 
increased developmental mortality (including late gestational fetal losses and extreme 
prematurity with associated ne onatal mortality) was noted in the absence of overt maternal 
toxicity. There were no nivolumab -related changes in surviving infants tested throughout the 6-
month postnatal period. Although the cause of these pregnanc y failures was undetermined, 
nivolumab-related effects on pregna ncy maintenance are consistent with the established role of 
PD-L1 in maintaining fetomate rnal tolerance in mice [15]. 
 1.3.[ADDRESS_428097] been asse ssed in subjects with non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC),  melanoma, and ccRCC in addition to  other tumor types. Nivolumab 
is being investigated both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and other immunotherapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. Nivolumab is approved in mu ltiple countries including the 
US for treatment of previously treated, unresec table or metastatic melanoma and previously 
treated, metastatic squamous NSCLC, the EU for treatment of previously treated, unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma, an d Japan for treatment of  unresectable melanoma. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ni volumab was studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered as a single dos e or as multiple doses of nivol umab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geometric mean (% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7 %), geometric mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss)  was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometri c mean elimination half-life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%). Steady-state con centrations of nivolum ab were reached by 12 
weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3-fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered every [ADDRESS_428098] on 
the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gende r, race, baseline LDH, PD-L1. A PK analysis 
suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab ba sed on age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline 
tumor size, and hepatic impairme nt. Although ECOG status, baseline  glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic im pairment had an effect  on nivolumab CL, the 
effect was not clinically meaningful. When ni volumab is administered  in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the CL of nivolumab  was increased by 24%, whereas  there was no effect on the 
clearance of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Additiona lly, PK and exposure response analyses have been performed 
to support use of [ADDRESS_428099] itute for the previously studied 3 mg/kg Q2W 
regimen. Using a PK model, exposure of nivoluma b at 240 mg flat dose was identical to a dose 
of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, whic h was the approximate median body weight in 
nivolumab clinical trials. The 240 mg q 2 week flat dose of ni volumab monotherapy has recently 
received FDA approval.

Nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344682].   [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety The overall safety experience wi th nivolumab, as a monotherapy or  in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in appr oximately 8,[ADDRESS_428101] advanced combination under development is nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344683]. Results to date suggest that the safety profile 
of nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344684]. Th e nature of the AEs is similar to  that observed with either agent 
used as monotherapy; however, both frequency and severity of most AEs are increased with the 
combination.  1.[ADDRESS_428102]-in-human Phase I study of nivolumab was pe rformed in patients with  treatment refractory 
solid tumors [16]. Nivolumab was administered as a single dose ranging from 0.3 to 10mg/kg 
and objective responses were not ed including in a patient with  RCC and there were no dose 
limiting toxicities observed within 4 weeks of th e initial dose. The serum half-life of nivolumab 
ranged from 12 to 20 days. A multi-dose Phas e I dose escalation trial extended the above 
findings in 296 patients with advanced solid tumors given nivolumab at doses from 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 2 years [17].  Ob jective tumor responses were noted in 9 of 33 
patients with RCC. Common treatmen t related side effects were fa tigue, anorexia, nausea, rash, 
and diarrhea. Grade 3 or 4 toxic ities were reported in 14% of patients and evident at all dose 
levels without obvious dose dependency but onl y 15 patients (5%) discon tinued treatment for 
toxicity reasons. Immune related adverse events  of special interest were observed including 
pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, hypophys itis and thyroiditis but were reversible. Extended follow 
up of patients on this study showed a median  response duration of 12.9 months and median 
overall survival in this heav ily pretreated population was 22.4 m onths [18]. Three of [ADDRESS_428103] 45 weeks. Among 168 
RCC patients randomized in blinded fashion to nivolumab dosed at 0.3, 2 and 10mg/kg, there 
was no observable dose-response relationship with objective responses in 20-22% of patients and 
Clinical Study Protocol

Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page 17 of 71 median survival ranging from 18.2 to 25.5 months [19]. In the Ch eckmate 025 Phase III trial, 
821 patients with advanced RCC with a clear ce ll component who had received previous 
antiangiogenic therapy, were rando mly assigned to receive 3 mg/ kg of nivolumab every 2 weeks 
or everolimus [19, 20]. The prim ary outcome, overall survival was significantly improved for 
nivolumab (median 25.0 versus 19.6 months) with HR 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.002).  
The objective response rate was higher with ni volumab (25% vs. 5%; P< 0.001) but the median 
progression-free survival was simi lar at 4.6 months versus 4.4 m onths. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-
related adverse events were lower at 19% for ni volumab versus 37% for everolimus. Quality of 
life improved significantly more in the nivolumab  group over [ADDRESS_428104] bene fit from nivolumab, highlighting the importance of predictive 
biomarker research.   In a biomarker-based trial of  91 patients with advanced RCC, 67 pretreated patients were 
randomized to receive 0.3, 2 or 10mg/kg of ni volumab every 3 weeks and 24 treatment-naïve 
patients received the 10mg/kg dose [21]. The primary objective was to study the 
immunomodulatory activity of nivolumab on tu mor biopsies and serum chemokines. Among 56 
evaluable specimens, 18 (32%) were PD-L1 positive defined as > 5% tumor cells with any tumor 
membrane staining by [CONTACT_344750]. Four of 18 (22%) of PD-L1(+) and 3/38 (8%) PD-L1(-) patients had objective responses a nd the overall response rate in th e entire cohort was 16% with 
expected grade 3 immune related adverse events in 15%.  1.5 Nivolumab + Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344685] a higher frequency of serious  adverse events [22, 23]. In a 
Phase I trial (CheckMate 016) patients with  advanced RCC were ra ndomized to receive 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b 1 mg/kg (N3 + I1, 47 patients ) or nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg (N1 + I3, 47 pa tients) intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 
[CONTACT_337583] 2 weeks [24]. An exploratory nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg arm 
(N3 + I3) showed unacceptable ear ly toxicity after 6 patients  and did not proceed to the 
expansion phase. Approximately half the patie nts were previously tr eated. Treatment-related 
toxicities were seen in 88% of patients and 16% discontinue d therapy for toxicity reasons. 
Serious Grade 3 or 4 treatment-rel ated adverse events occurred in 34% and 64% of patients in 
N3 + I1 and N1 + I3, respectively, most commonly  manifest as elevated lipase or amylase, 
elevated liver function tests, di arrhea and colitis. After a medi an 8 months of follow up, the 
objective response rate was 38% and 43% and me dian progression free survival was 30.3 and 36 
weeks respectively in N3 + I1 and N1 + I3 arms. Among responders, th e median duration of 
response was 67.7 weeks (range 4.1+ to 91.1+) in the N3 + I1 arm and 81.1 weeks (range 6.1+ to 
81.1+) in the N1 + I3 arm. Overal l both treatment arms appeared to confer similar anti-tumor 
activity but the N1 + I3 arm was associated with  higher gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicities. 
The promising activity and tolerabi lity of the N3 + I1 schedule  has led to an ongoing randomized 
Phase III registrational trial comparing this combination to sunitinib monotherapy in the 
approved schedule, in patients with advanced cl ear cell RCC.  This trial reached its accrual goal 
of 1070 patients in the fall of 2015. The co-prima ry endpoints are progression free and overall

nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344686], ORR and OS over sunitnib in patients with 
intermediate and poor risk tr eatment naïve RCC and was FDA a pproved in April of 2018 for 
these patients.  The nivo/ipi [INVESTIGATOR_344687].  The tr eatment was reasonably we ll tolerated with only a 
3rd of patients having grade 3 IrAes and Quality of  Life analyses showed the combination to be 
superior to sunitinib [25].   1.6 Biomarkers for Response and Resistance to Anti-PD1 Based Immunotherapy Several prognostic clinical factor s and models (e.g. MSKCC, Heng) have been developed to risk 
stratify survival outco mes for patients with advanced RCC.  However, predictive biomarker 
development is critical to identify patient subgr oups who are likely to ex perience frequent and/or 
durable responses to particular th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The importance of this unmet need is heightened by [CONTACT_344751], prolonged duration of e xposure to, or toxicities of curre nt therapeutic agents. Tumor 
associated PD-L1 expression has been proposed as  a potential biomarker fo r sensitivity to PD-[ADDRESS_428105] inhibitors in other tumors.   In the phase I trial of nivolumab in patients with  advanced solid tumors, 9 of 25 patients with 
PD-L1 positive tumors responded co mpared with 0 of 17 patients with PD-L1 negative tumors 
(p=0.006); only 5 of these patients had mRCC.[ 17] In the Checkmate 025 registration Phase III 
trial of nivolumab versus everolimus,  tumor PD-L1 membrane expression ( ≥1% vs. <1% and 
≥5% vs. <5%) was evaluated centr ally using the Dako PD-L1 imm unohistochemical stain [20]. 
Among 756 patients with quantifiable PD-L 1 expression, 181 (24%) had > 1% PD-L1 
expression in at least 100 tumor cells. However, the benefit of nivolumab relative to everolimus 
on overall survival did not differ in these two PDL1 defined subgroups at either this cutoff or 
when a 5% cut off was used. Interestingly, patien ts bearing PD-L1 positiv e tumors appeared to 
have shorter overall survival on either treatment relative to those with PD-L1 negative tumors, 
consistent with previous reports of PD-L1 e xpression being a marker of poor prognosis.  The 
lack of predictive value for PD-L1 expression in  RCC diverges from data for nivolumab in lung 
cancer and melanoma. However, it should be noted that those data primarily focused on ORR 
rather than overall survival a nd ORR data for the Checkmate 025 st udy has yet to be reported.  In 
the aforementioned Phase I study of atezolizum ab in RCC, there was no suggestion of a 
correlation between tumor cell PD-L1 status a nd antitumor activity. Ho wever immune cell PD-
L1 expression measured using a diagnostic  Spring Biosciences PD-L1 antibody SP142, 
suggested a trend towards improved ORR, P FS and OS with > 1% immune cell PD-L1 
expression which was observed in 63 % of the informative patients.  
 These data highlight the limitations of using PD-L [ADDRESS_428106] not been compared with each ot her, use different cutoff points 
and measure expression on di fferent cells within the tumor micr oenvironment (tumor cells or an 
aggregate reading of a variety of  immune cells). Furt hermore, PD-L1 is an  inducible molecule 
and tumors are frequently hete rogeneous, affecting assay reproduc ibility especially at the low 
end of the range. Discordance between primary tumor and metastases for PD-L1 positivity in 
both directions was observed in kidney cancer in 11 of 53 cases (20.8%) using a validated anti-
PD-L1 antibody (405.9A11) and formally quantified membranous expression in  tumor cells [26].  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-260 
Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page 19 of 71 The predictive utility of PD-L1 expression is li kely to be more challenging in combination 
regimens. Lastly, while PD-L1 pos itivity is associated  with poorer survival  in non-clear cell 
RCC, its predictive value for immunotherapy is unknown [27].  
 At this time therefore, PD-L1 a ssay results are inadequate to be  used to select or otherwise 
manage patients with advanced  RCC receiving PD-[ADDRESS_428107] year [28]. The clinical experience with high dose (HD) IL-2 has provided 
proof of principle that immunot herapy can produce durable respons es in a small percentage of 
patients with ccRCC and obviate the need for subse quent therapy [29]. Howe ver, its toxicity and 
limited efficacy has severely na rrowed its application. Agents that induce a high proportion of 
durable tumor responses with accep table toxicity remain a critic al unmet need for RCC patients. 
Tumor-induced immune suppression may e xplain why immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_344688]. The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway is one of the most 
critical mediators of tumor-induced immune  suppression [30]. Many human solid tumors, 
including cc and non-ccRCC, express PD-L1, one of  the ligands for PD-1, as a consequence of 
oncogene expression or as an adapti ve response to exposure from IFN- γ produced by [CONTACT_28746] T 
lymphocytes [31]. PD-1 engageme nt by [CONTACT_344752] (PD-L1, PD-L2)  inhibits T-cell proliferation, 
cytokine production, cytolytic function and surviv al [32]. Tumor-infiltra ting lymphocytes (TIL) 
from patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_344689]-[ADDRESS_428108] impaired anti-tumor functionality 
[33, 34]. PD-L1 expression on renal tumors porte nds worse prognosis high lighting the clinical 
impact of this interaction [35].  Ongoing clinical trials evaluati ng PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have de monstrated promising clinical 
efficacy with durable benefit in a subset of  ccRCC patients who have progressed after prior 
therapy [17, 36-38]. Preliminary co rrelative studies have demonstr ated that while tumor PD-L1 
expression may increase the likelihood of benefit with PD-1 blockade, it  fails to identify all 
responders. [17, 37, 39, 40]. Given the robust antitumor activity of VEGF pathway inhibitors, the application of single agent PD-1 blockade in  the treatment naïve setting will require the 
development of biomarkers with greater positiv e predictive value. Combination approaches are 
actively being investigated (e.g. combined inhibition of both CTLA -[ADDRESS_428109]. In particular, tumors 
may escape PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade due to subo ptimal T-cell activation, and CTLA-4 blockade 
could potentially overcome this escape mechanis m [41]. Prior to PD-[ADDRESS_428110] tumor reactive T-cells, 
producing interferon and resulting in upregul ation of PD-L1 expression in the tumor 
microenvironment [42]. When us ed after PD-1 or PD-L1 bloc kade, CTLA-4 blockade could 
deplete T-regulatory cells that impair CD8-positive T-cell function [43]. Further work is needed 
to investigate the hypothesis that  patients who do not respond to PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade may 
be salvaged by [CONTACT_344753]-4 blockade. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-260 
Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page 20 of 71 To optimize the therapeutic potent ial of single agent, PD-1 bloc kade in patients with kidney 
cancer, we propose a translational clinical trial that integrates clinic opathologic assessment, 
genomics and immunology to gain clearer mechanistic understandi ng of the effects of PD-1 
blockade.   Our goals are to address several critical unanswered questions incl uding: 1) How active is PD-1 
blockade in treatment naïve ki dney cancer? 2) What factors, in addition to PD-L1 expression, 
can reliably predict durable res ponse? 3) Do gene expression  signatures which are likely 
capturing the presence, magnitude, and activity of adaptive immune  infiltrates reliably predict 
durable response 4) Is there a threshold for PD-L 1 expression in either the tumor or immune cell 
infiltrate that accurately predic ts durable response? 5) Is PD-L1 expression uniform and stable in 
an individual tumor and between  a primary tumor and its me tastases? 6) What are the 
mechanisms of innate resistance to PD-[ADDRESS_428111] blockade?  7)  Can the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344690]/or enha nce response it patients with prolonged stable disease?  
 Both the PD-[ADDRESS_428112] shown efficacy  in mRCC as monotherapy [34]. Nivolumab is a high affinity 
humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibo dy directed against human PD- 1. It blocks its interaction 
with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.  It has shown encouraging efficacy in patients with 
melanoma and lung cancer [44, 45] and is curr ently FDA approved for patients with VEGFR 
TKI resistant RCC.   The application of PD-[ADDRESS_428113] blockade in the treatment naïve setting 
may yield even better results and delay the need  for subsequent lines of  therapy in selected 
patients.  Patients with melanoma who were prev iously untreated had greater response rates to 
nivolumab than ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-treated patients (40%  vs 28% respectively).  While combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_344691] a large role in the future  for many patients, there is  a distinct subset of 
patients with RCC that will likely benefit with dura ble responses and increased PFS rate at 1 year 
to single immune checkpoint blockade [24, 37, 38, 46]. This hypothesis will be explored in Part 
A. The ability of the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344692] B.  
 Approximately 20% of all patients with kidney cancer have ncc RCC. A recent analysis of tumor 
specimens revealed that while nccRCC expresses less PD-L1 on average, a substantial portion of 
nccRCC tumors express >5% PD-L1 on their surface , including: 43% of translocation-positive 
(3/7), 50% of oncocytoma (2/4), and 10% of papi [INVESTIGATOR_31887] (5/50) [47]. In the Phase 1 trial of 
atezolizumab, 1/7 non-clear cell m RCC patients had a partial respons e to therapy [37]. Given the 
current lack of effective ther api[INVESTIGATOR_344693]-cl ear cell kidney cancer and the 
preliminary evidence of clinical activity, the explor ation of PD-1 blockade seems rational in this 
substantial group of patients.

weeks of additional therapy is suggested. Patients w ith persistent PD at confirmatory scan will be 
evaluated for enrollment on Part B of this study. Symptomatic patients may be evaluated for Part 
B immediately.  Patients without confirmed PD can continue on nivolumab therapy.   
 Patients who experience symptomatic or confir med PD (or have best response of SD at 48 
weeks/end of Cycle 6) on nivolumab monotherapy will be eligible for consideration for Part B. 
Part B involves the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344696] r up to 4 doses while maintaining nivolumab 
therapy. Dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_344697] 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks togeth er with nivolumab changed to

the patients accrued to the first-line trea tment will go on to enroll in Part B.  
 An additional biopsy will be performed of a metast atic lesion at time of confirmed PD in all 
patients enrolling in Part B. Conf irmation of tumor in the biopsy specimen must occur prior to 
initiation of treatment on Part B.  Subjects unable to undergo a new tumor biopsy and have tissue 
slow frozen for scRNAseq are not eligible for Part B.   An additional cohort of 40 non-ccRCC patients will be enrolled and analyzed separately for 
evidence of anti-tumor activity ( CR, PR and SD and PFS at 1 year of nivolumab). These patients 
will also be eligible for partic ipation in Part B (as described for patients with ccRCC).  We 
anticipate that the accrual of these 40 patients will  be able to be completed within the 1.5 years 
needed for accrual of  the ccRCC patients.

1. If the screening physical exam is conducted within 24 hours of dosing on Day 1, then a single examination may count as both the  screening and pre-dose 
evaluation. Vitals required are temperature, pulse, r espi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.  
2. Hematology Labs should include CBC with diffe rential (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white bl ood cells, platelets, neutrophils, lympho cytes, eosinophils and 
monocytes). Additional draws must be incorporated when monitori ng recovery from any hematologic AE.  Chemistry Labs should incl ude albumin, BUN, 
creatinine, ALT, AST, bilirubin serum alkaline phosphatase, gluco se, total protein, sodium, potassium, chloride, HCO3, calcium.   Labs should be performed 
on the day of treatment but may be drawn up to 72 hours before to ensure return of  results prior to dosing. 
3. Other labs to be drawn: amylase, lipase, LDH, direct bilirubin ( only if total bilirubin is elevated), uric acid and CPK Day 1 o f every Cycle during treatment.  
Thyroid function will be monitored Day 1 of each cycle during treat ment. TSH will be monitored and T3 and T4 (free versus total ) should be drawn at site 
investigators discretion. It is suggested that if TSH is elev ated T3 and T4 values may be done. At screening, testing should be  performed for hepatitis C 
antibody and HBs Ag utilizing local standard informed consent pr ocedures prior to this laboratory collection. These tests could  be repeated later during the 
course of the study if clinically indicated.  
4. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or ur ine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_428161]. Im aging of other sites should be obtained when clinically indica ted. If follow up scans 
indicate partial or complete response, a repeat confirmatory scan  should be obtained within 12 weeks (but no sooner than 6 week s). Subjects with equivocal 
disease progression (e.g. a new lesion in the setting of major di sease regression and the absence of or improvement in disease related symptoms) should have a 
scan confirming disease progression 4-[ADDRESS_428162] defined PD.  Part A imaging will occur at baseline within 4 weeks 
of C1D1 of Part A, then at week 12 (after C1 and C2 of Part A Induction), week 18 (after C3 and before C4 of Part A Maintenance ), week 24 (after C4 of Part 
A maintenance) and then every 12 weeks (± 1 week).  Patients w ith symptomatic and radiographic PD will not require a confirmato ry scan before proceeding 
to Part B of this study. Following crossover, imaging and calenda r will be reset at Cycle 1.  Part B imaging will occur at base line within 4 weeks prior to 
crossover, then at week 12 (after C1 and C2 of Part B Induction) , week 18 (after C3 and before C4 Part B Maintenance), week 24 (after C4 Part B 
Maintenance) and then every 12 weeks (± 1 week). Every 12 week s radiology imaging will occur if the patient is < 2 years from s tudy entry (or < 2 years from 
crossover), then radiology imaging will o ccur every 6 months (± 4 weeks) until [ADDRESS_428163] not yet experienced progressive disease (PD) at the time treat ment is discontinued, the follow-up tumor evaluations will b e documented in the eCRF until 
PD or death is confirmed, or until another treatment is initiated.   
6. 1 Cycle= (6 weeks) for Part A (induction and maintenance C3 and C4) and Part B (induction and maintenance C3 and C4). 1 Cycle =  12 weeks for Part A 
maintenance C 5-10 and Part B maintenance C5-C7. Treatment and follow-up schedule is the same for either nivolumab monotherapy or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab combination. Patients r esponding in Part A will receive treatment at most through Cycle 10 (week 96).  Pat ients crossing over to Part B 
will receive treatment at most through Cycle 7 (week 60) from star t of Part B.  They will then have treatment stopped and be fo llowed until disease progression 
or study closure. Once confirmed progression is confirmed or stab le disease for 48 weeks (end of Cycle 6), nivolumab monotherap y will be discontinued for 
Part A and the patient will undergo evaluation for Part B treatment.  
7. Mandatory Samples: Peripheral blood for somatic baseline testing w ill be collected prior to treatment on C1D1 Part A.  PBMCs an d plasma are preferred (or 
whole blood) for TCR assay and will be collected prior to treatme nt (C1D1), C3D1, C5D1 (Part A) and at time of progression (Pri or to Part B). See

Section 7.   8.1 Analyses  
 8.1.1 Assessment of PD-L1 Expression on Tumo r and Infiltrating Mononuclear Cells  
Tumor cell surface PD-L1 expression on prim ary tumor specimens se rves as a potential 
predictive biomarker of durable response to PD-1 antibody thera py [17]. However, data from 
several recent studies su ggest that IHC staining for PD-L1 alone fails to identify all responders to 
PD-1 blocking Abs [39, 40]. Some patients w ith PD-L1 negative tumors respond to PD-[ADDRESS_428166] in patients with negative PD-L 1 tumor expression [22]. We will test whether PD-
L1 status is indeed predictive of higher response to combined  checkpoint blockade. 
 8.1.2 Assessment of Tumor IFN Gamma Signat ure, Mutational Load, and Maximum 
Fuhrman Grade  In patients with metastatic RCC,  treatment with nivolumab result ed in increased expression of 
genes indicative of Th1-type inflammatory res ponse and cytotoxic T cel l activation, such as 
ICOS, interferon-gamma, granzy mes, and perforin [48]. In addition, CXCL9 and CXCL10, two 
interferon-gamma-regulated chemokines that in turn  regulate trafficking of T cells, and are both 
prognostic [49] and predictive of response to  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] [50]. We propose to study tumor 
interferon-gamma signature [CONTACT_344773] a marker of  response to PD-1 and PD-
1/CTLA-4 blockade.  Accumulating evidence shows that anti-tumor immune responses focus on neoantigens generated 
by [CONTACT_344757], and responsiv eness to immunotherapy correla tes with neoantigen burden. 
[51, 52]. Mutational load has been  correlated with response to C LTA-4 and PD-1 blockade in 
melanoma [53, 54] and multiple ot her tumor types [55-57]. These data motivate us to perform a 
systematic analysis of mutation burden and ne oantigen load using Whole Exome Sequencing 
(WES). We will explore potential neoantigen s in subsets of responding and non-responding 
patients. We will also evaluate changes in neoant igen load at the time of resistance compared 
with baseline samples.  Tumor cell PD-L1 expression has been correlated with higher Fuhrman nuc lear grade [26]. In a 
cohort of mRCC patients treated with PD-L1 anti body, overall response rate was slightly higher 
in patients with Fuhrman grade 4 and/or sarc omatoid histology (ORR 22 % versus 15% in the 
overall cohort) [58]. Therefore, we will asse ss Fuhrman grade and sarcomatoid histology as 
predictors of response.

molecules. Then, lymphocytes must be primed a nd activated. Lymphocytes must be trafficked to 
the tumor and subsequently infiltrate the tumor, then they must recognize the tumor cells, and 
finally they must produce cyto toxic effect. “Non-inflamed” tu mors, those that lack tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes, may have  a defect in early steps of the generation of this immune 
response and may have primary re sistance to PD-1 blockade. “Inf lamed” tumors, those that do 
contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocyt es, may have defects in later st eps such as loss or alteration 
of MHC-I [59-61]. Multiple ot her checkpoints may become activ ated [62-65] Finally other 
immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment may blunt  the T-cell response. We will 
perform exploratory analyses to evaluate thes e mechanisms further, including exploratory 
analyses of immune cells using immunosequencing.   8.2. Tissue Collections SEE CLM FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.  8.2.1 Archival Tumor Tissue Archival tissue of a metastatic lesion (from core needle or excisional biopsy) obtained within 1

entitled, "Using Single Cell Transcriptomics to Understand Tumor and Immune Heterogeneity

Whole blood will be collected prior to treatment Cycle 1 Day 1 for somatic testing. 
 8.3.2 Mandatory PBMCs and Plasma (preferred ) or Whole Blood for TCR analysis  
Whole blood for PBMCs and plasma  isolation for TCR analysis s hould be collected at baseline 
(C1D1), C3D1, C5D1 and at time of disease pr ogression.  If PBMCs cannot be processed on site, 
whole blood may be collected. See CLM fo r collection and processing instructions.

For the purposes of this study, subjects should be  evaluated for response every [ADDRESS_428171]. Imaging of other sites should be 
obtained when clinically indica ted. If follow up scans indicate part ial or complete response, a 
repeat confirmatory scan shoul d be obtained within 12 weeks (but no sooner than 6 weeks). 
Subjects with equivocal disease progression (e.g. a new lesion in the setting of major disease

HCRN GU16-260 
Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page 40 of 71 regression and the absence of or  improvement in disease relate d symptoms) should have a scan 
confirming disease progression 4- [ADDRESS_428172] scan will be th e documented date of 
progression.  Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the intern ational criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_129592] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009] and irRECIST. Change s in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesi ons and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in RECIST.  The following general princi ples must be followed: 
1. To assess objective response, it is necessary  to estimate the overall tumor burden at 
baseline to which subsequent  measurements will be compar ed. All baseline  evaluations 
should be performed as closel y as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than four weeks before registration. 
2. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_344759]. 
3. All measurements should be recorded in me tric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or calipers.  
4. The same method of assessment and the same  technique must be used to characterize 
each identified lesion at baseline and during follow-up.

below.  Those subjects that ar e inevaluable will not be replaced.

be considered evaluable.)  9.1.[ADDRESS_428174] one measur able lesion. Measurable 
lesions are defined as those that can be accurate ly measured in at leas t one dimension (longest 
diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_428175] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_428176] scan, or >10 mm with 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-260 
Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page [ADDRESS_428177] ed in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters). 
 NOTE: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previ ously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable. If the site investigator  thinks it appropriate to include them, the 
conditions under which such lesions should be co nsidered must be defi ned in the protocol. 
 9.2.[ADDRESS_428178] be >[ADDRESS_428179] scan (CT scan  slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 9.2.3 Non-measurable Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions  (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), ar e considered non-measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, pleural/p ericardial effusi ons, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory br east disease, and abdominal ma sses (not followed by [CONTACT_118445]), are considered as non-measur able. Non-measurable also incl udes lesions that are < [ADDRESS_428180] x-ray.  NOTE:   Cystic lesions that meet th e criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither me asurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic le sions’ thought to represent cystic  metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurabili ty described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same subjec t, these are preferred fo r selection as target 
lesions. 
 9.2.4 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesi ons should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representa tive of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible  measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducib ly should be selected. A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, shor t axis for nodal le sions) for all target  lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the ba seline sum diameters. If lymph node s are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characteri ze any objective tumor regression in  the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  9.2.5 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable  lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified  as non-target lesions and should also be r ecorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each sh ould be noted throughout follow-up.

Complete 
Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must  have reduction in short axis to 
<[ADDRESS_428181] be confirmed by a repeat assessment 
performed no less than six weeks after the criteria for response is met. 
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  To be assigned a status of partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by a repeat assessment performed no less than six weeks after the criteria for response is met. 
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest  sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smalle st on study). In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must  also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. ( NOTE:   the appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progressions).  Subjects with equivocal disease progression (e.g. a new lesion in the setting of 
major disease regression and the absence of or improvement in 
disease related symptoms) should have a scan confirming disease progression 4-[ADDRESS_428182] defined PD.  Subjects may continue on protocol therapy until repeat scan confirms PD. If repeat scan does not confirm PD, subjects 
should proceed with treatment and evaluation as directed by [CONTACT_344761] (if between [ADDRESS_428183] scan) being counted as the 6 week interval scan. 
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  NOTE:  a change of 20% or more that does not 
increase the sum of the diameters by 5 mm or more is coded as stable disease). To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements 
must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study 
entry at a minimum interval of 24 weeks. 
 
  
Clinical Study Protocol

Version Date: 25MAR2021 C onfidential Page 43 of 71 9.4 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) Disa ppearance of all non-target lesions.  All lymph nodes 
must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) 
Non-CR/ Non-PD Persistence of one  or more non-target lesion(s)  
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target 
lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  When the subject also has measurable disease, there must be an overall level of substantial wo rsening in non-target disease 
such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target 
disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression 
solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the 
face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  When the subject only has non-measurable disease, the increase in overall disease burden should be comparable in magnitude to the increase that 
would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: 
i.e., an increase in tumor burd en from “trace” to “large”, 
an increase in nodal disease from “localized” to “widespread”, or an increase sufficient to require a change in therapy. Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only 
is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_344717], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or sponso
r-investigator). 
 
9.5 Evaluation of New Lesions The appearance of new lesions constitutes Progr essive Disease (PD).  A growing lymph node 
that did not meet the criteria for reporting as a measurab le or non-measurable lymph node at 
baseline should only be reported as a new lesi on (and therefore progressive disease) if it:  
 Increases in size to ≥ 15 mm in the short axis, or  
 There is new pathological confirmation that it is disease (regardless of size). New 
effusion or ascites that appears during trea tment should only be re ported as a new lesion 
(and therefore progressive dis ease) if it has cytological confirmation of malignancy.

 9.8.3 Additional Criteria to Conti nue Treatment after Progression 
Patients may continue on protocol  therapy until repeat s can confirms PD.  If repeat scan does not 
confirm PD, patients should proceed with treatme nt and evaluation as di rected by [CONTACT_344762] (if between [ADDRESS_428187] scan) being counted as the [ADDRESS_428188] (irRECIST)  
PFS, ORR and duration of respons e per irRECIST are defined as  specified for the respective 
endpoints using RECIST 1.1 above, with the excepti on that a confirmation a ssessment of PD (4-
6 weeks after the initial PD a ssessment) is required for subj ects who remain on treatment 
following a documented PD per RECIST 1.1.  The first date of progre ssion, confirmed on the 
subsequent imaging study, will be considered th e date of progression. Subjects who discontinue 
treatment following a documented PD assessmen t per RECIST 1.1 will be counted as having 
disease progression on the date of the documented PD assessment.

The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE v4.03 will be utilized for AE 
assessment throughout the life of the protocol. A copy of th e CTCAE v4.03 criteria can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website  at http://ctep.can cer.gov. All forms for AE/SAE recording 
and reporting can be found in the Study Proce dure Manual or in the EDC system (Documents 
and Information Tab).  11.1 Definitions 
 11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence whethe r or not considered re lated to the study drug 
that appears to change in intens ity during the course of the stu dy. The following are examples of 
AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associated w ith participation in the protocol 
 An intercurrent illness or injury that  impairs the well-be ing of the subject 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diag nostic test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatme nt or further di agnostic tests   
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344736] 
(e.g., surgical insertion of central line) should not be recorded as an AE.  
 Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable to the study 
regimen by [CONTACT_6962].  
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A SAE is an adverse event that: 
 Results in death. NOTE:  Death due to disease progressi on should not be reported as a 
SAE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_941] s ite investigator to  the study drug(s) 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in wh ich the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] >24 hours or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. NOTE:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344737], central  line insertion, metast asis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tu mor, or elective surgery, will  not be considered serious 
adverse events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect 
 
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or re sult in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, ma y jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-260

above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, inte nsive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscr asias or convulsions 
not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the de velopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
11.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Event 
For this study, an AE is considered unexpected when it varies in nature , intensity or frequency 
from information provided in the cu rrent IB, prescribing information or when it is not included in 
the informed consent document as a potential ri sk. Unexpected also refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a cl ass of drugs or are anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically me ntioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.    11.1.4  Relatedness 
AEs will be categorized according to the likeliho od that they are related to the study drug(s). 
Specifically, they will be categorized using the following terms:   
Unrelated Adverse Event is not related  to the study drug(s)  
Unlikely Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the study drug(s)  
Possible Adverse Event may be related  to the study drug(s)  
Probable Adverse Event is  likely related  to the study drug(s)  
Definite Adverse Event is clearly related  to the study drug(s)

(or 54 expected) patients will have 0% PD-L1 and roughly 15% (or 18 expected) patients will express PD-L1 > 20%, which, given the sample  size of 120 ccRCC patient s provides 90% power 
using a 0.[ADDRESS_428201] the hypoth esis that PD-L1 >20% will be associated with 
significantly improved 1-year PFS rate for patients  treated with PD-1 blockade (55% vs 13% 
taken as a binomial quantity). C onsidering the four groups of PD-L1 expression (0%, 1-5%, 5-
20%, >20%), and with an expected patient allo cation within groups of (45%, 25%, 15%, 15%),

19%, 35%, 55%) using a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_428203] the power. For example, 
if the distribution across PD-L1 categories is [25%, 25%, 25%, 25 %] rather than the anticipated 
[45%, 25%, 15%, 15%] the power for the tr end test remains greater than 90%. 
 As a secondary objective, we will apply the PRP model, developed in the DF/HCC Kidney 
SPORE Project 4, to assign each patie nt a probability of having PFS >[ADDRESS_428204] 
distribution is unknown, but assuming  an overall 1-year PFS of 28% and that 40% of patients are 
expected to be “positive” by [CONTACT_344748], 120 ccRCC patients give 90% power to detect a 
29% higher 1-year PFS between 48 positive patients a nd 72 negative patients (via Fisher’s exact 
test and assuming a difference in PFS of 46% vs 17%). All testing above will be done at 1-sided 
α=0.025. The specific distributional breakdowns are unknown but the po wer is relatively robust. 
For example, if the split between positive and nega tive is more even (50/50) then power for the 
above difference in 1-yr PFS rema ins over 90%. If the actual diffe rence in 1-yr PFS is smaller 
than anticipated for example 25% (44% vs 19%) th en the test will still ha ve at least 80% power.

treatment with the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The primar y endpoint of this por tion of the trial will 
be objective response (CR or PR) ta king as baseline tumor measuremen ts at the patient’s start of 
Part B. It is expected that r oughly one-half of the Part A patients will be eligible for and choose 
to enroll in Part B, or roughly [ADDRESS_428206] 2 responses, there will be sufficient evidence to 
continue recruitment to Part B.  With a true uninteresting resp onse rate of 5%, there is a 57% 
chance of declaring the regimen un interesting; however, with an  interesting response rate of 
20%, there is greater than 95% ch ance of continuing. If after enrol lment of [ADDRESS_428207] 11 total responses, the lower limit on the 90% confidence in terval for the true response 
rate will exclude 10% (ie, the 95% confidence in terval will range from 10 .6% to 28.5%, adjusted 
for the two-stage design). With 18 total response s, the 90% confidence interval on the true 
objective response proportion will exclude 20% (i t, the confidence interval will range from 
20.4% to 41.2%, adjusted for the two-stage design).   12.3 Non-clear cell (ncc) RCC: Part A Subjects (comprising a heterogeneous group of histologi es) will also be enrolled in the trial, at an 
accrual rate that is expected to be 33% that of clear cell patients. Therefore, an expected cohort

tumor activity, principall y focusing on overall response rate (CR or PR). With  40 patients, the

should accrue in 2 years.    12.7 Endpoints 
 12.7.1  Definition of Primary Endpoint 
 PFS is defined as the time from Day [ADDRESS_428216] 1.1 or death as a result of any cause.  
 The primary focus of this trial will be in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression levels to 
predict outcome. We expect that about 45% (o r 54 expected) patients will have 0% PD-
L1 and roughly 15% (or 18 expected) patien ts will express PD-L1 > 20%, which, given 
the sample size of 120 ccRCC patients provide s 90% power using a 0.[ADDRESS_428217] the hypothesis th at PD-L1 >20% will be asso ciated with significantly

 12.7.2  Secondary Endpoints 
 Apply the PRP model, developed in the DF/HCC Kidney SPORE Project 4, to assign 
each patient a probability of having PFS > 1 year. 
 The endpoint for Part B (addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b) will be objective response (CR or PR) 
taking as baseline tumor measurements at the patient’s start of Part B. 
 An expected cohort of 40 nccRCC patients will  be enrolled in the trial and analyzed 
separately for evidence of anti-tumor activ ity, principally focusing on overall response 
rate (CR or PR).

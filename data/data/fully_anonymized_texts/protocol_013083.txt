Goal: 1. Periodic reflection and performance review to allow trainees to visualize their progress and trajectory in training – where are you now and where are you going? 2. Maximize the potential for professional development during residency and/or fellowship. 3. improve burnout and response to stress by [CONTACT_597535][INVESTIGATOR_597532]. 4. Ensure 1:1 relationship with core faculty to prevent trainees from going unnoticed in a large academic medical center. 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, 2005    2   Hypothesis: Residents & Fellows (herein referred to as trainees) will benefit from a Professional Development Coaching Program in the following ways: 1. A Professional Development Coaching Program, based on the principles of positive psychology, will improve trainees well-being, compared to non-coached controls. 2. A Professional Development Coaching Program, based on the principles of positive psychology, will improve trainees workplace satisfaction, compared to non-coached controls.     3. A Professional Development Coaching Program will decrease trainees and faculty coach burnout and improve their resiliency by [CONTACT_597536], improve their reponse to stress of uncertainty, and decrease emotional exhaustion, compared to controls.  4. A Professional Development Coaching Program, based on the principles of positive psychology, will improve faculty coach well-being, compared to non-coach controls.   BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the proposed study and procedures.  Coaching is used in business and many other career paths to help the individual define and create their own goals and strategies for achieving those goals.   The MGH Professional Development Coaching Program applies this model to help our residents in their professional development as physicians.  While our housestaff have many evaluators, letter-writers and mentors, our coaching program provides them the opportunity for a non-program director faculty member to review their entire portfolio and development throughout residency in a coaching role.  It was successfully developed and rolled out in 2011.  This program was evaluated from 2012-present, and based on its success, it has since been adopted by >[ADDRESS_789636] of this coaching program delivered remotely for women surgery residents in the Association of Women Surgeons.  The goal of the Professional Development Coaching Program is to allow trainees to understand their development over time, find meaning and 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_789637] with a group of like-minded physicians.    The program design will be mirrored on our internal medicine coaching program - Each trainee is assigned a Professional Development Coach, who is a faculty member from a different department than theirs who has volunteered their time as a coach. In the Association of Women Surgeons cohort, the coach will be a faculty member who is a surgeon practicing in another area of the country than the resident. Professional Development Coaches are assigned on average 2 trainees and are responsible for meeting with them quarterly to review evaluations, encourage reflection, provide guidance, and motivate them to set learning goals for the upcoming rotations.  Once trainees are matched with their coach, they remain paired with their coach for the duration of the study (3 years).  There is a three-year curriculum based on positive psychology and leadership development that is based on quarterly meetings.  The faculty coaches receive [ADDRESS_789638], by [CONTACT_75848] a randomized trial comparing coaching to usual mentoring and well-being practices, and if successful, provide an opportunity for crossover in year 3 where all participants receive coaching.    This study would be carried out at MGH, and the AWS cohort would be carried out remotely, with the study team primarily existing at MGH (with one collaborate from AWS at the Cleveland Clinic). All residents from general surgery, OMFS, urology, OB/GYN, and neurosurgery and all internal medicine first year subspecialty fellows will be enrolled in the study.  A baseline survey will be obtained to allow for randomization to either coaching, or usual mentoring and well-being practices that exist in the residency and/or fellowship. We will quantitatively surveying the trainees and coaches regarding their experiences with and assessment of the 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, 2005    4  Professional Development Coaching Program at the end of each year the study period.    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled by [CONTACT_17839]-wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s protocol is open to both children and adults.” • All residents from general surgery, OMFS, urology, OB/GYN, and neurosurgery and all internal medicine first year subspecialty fellows will be enrolled in the study.   • All residents in the Association of Women’s Surgeons will be invited to participate in the study. • Control group – 50% of the study trainee population will be randomized to control in a 1:1 manner after baseline burnout data is obtained. 50% of the coaches who volunteer will be randomized to control in a 1:1 manner after baseline burnout data is obtained. In year 3, these trainees and coaches will crossover into the coaching intervention. • Study group – 50% of the study population will be randomized to coaching in a 1:1 manner after baseline burnout data is obtained. 50% of the coaches who volunteer will be randomized to coaching in a 1:1 manner after baseline burnout data is obtained. • Faculty and trainees will be surveyed at beginning and end of each academic year.  Surveys will be administered by a researcher not affiliated with the residency program, who has been involved in coaching research since 2011.  This researcher will collect the data centrally, which will be de-identified when shared with study staff or the training programs. • Training programs and the Association of Women Surgeons will be given access to the aggregate data, as well as the de-identified data from their training program.     Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe study endpoints. • Coaches are recruited via email to all teaching faculty within the representative training programs, and volunteer their time to serve as a faculty coach.  In the AWS cohort, they will be invited by [CONTACT_597537] 2018. They participate in 2 hours of mandatory faculty development coach training per academic year.  There is also an annual coach faculty development retreat that is not mandatory.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, 2005    5  • Trainees will be assigned to a professional development coach who is not likely to be a mentor, evaluator or letter-writer for the trainee • All trainees are oriented to the coaching program during a mandatory orientation session and informed about the study.  All incoming interns and fellows will be sent an email in advance to inform them of the study. • All AWS trainees will be oriented during an informational session at the 2018 AWS Annual Meeting. • All trainees and faculty (interventions and controls) will be asked to complete a baseline survey. • Intervention trainees and coaches will be expected to meet quarterly to review performance and establish learning goals for subsequent rotations. There is no consequence or repercussion for not meeting.  • All trainees enrolled (interventions and controls) will be asked to complete a survey at the end of each academic year inquiring about their workplace experiences, workplace relationships, burnout, resiliency, response to stress, hardiness, happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and gratitude.  This will serve as their baseline for the following academic year. • All coaches (interventions and controls) will be asked to complete a survey at baseline enrollment in the program and the end of each academic year about their workplace experiences, workplace relationships, burnout, resiliency, response to stress, hardiness, happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and gratitude.  This will serve as their baseline for the following academic year.  For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis. This study does not involve treatment or diagnoses.  Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by [CONTACT_17842]. This study does not involve treatment, diagnoses, or procedures  Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups. The only potential harm that could be anticipated from this study is if there is a large difference in experience in interventions and controls. We have 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, 2005    6  seen from our experience with internal medicine coaching that those who do not engage in coaching (people who chose to opt-out of regular coaching) do have higher burnout, but it is not clear if coaching is the correlation, or if in fact these people are avoiding coaching due to their burnout.  This study will help determine if there is a difference.    Confidentiality will be required of the coaches.  Specifically, they will be required not to share the details of confidential evaluations with other faculty. Coaches are not asked to report back on their meetings to the training program, unless they are concerned about the safety and well-being of the trainees, patients, or others.  The usual potential harms that these physicians may encounter in the course of their work in patient care are expected and their health and safety will be safeguarded as per the usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597533].  Since there are no treatment plans or procedures involved, there is no risk to the safety of the subjects.     FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779]. The only potential harm that could be anticipated from this study is if there is a large difference in experience in interventions and controls.  The usual potential harms that these physicians may encounter in the course of their work in patient care are expected and their health and safety will be safeguarded as per the usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597533].  The coaching program was agreed upon by [CONTACT_597538]. All trainees will be randomized but coaching program and survey participation is voluntary. In the study there is risk of discomfort for the trainees and coaches in filling out surveys about burnout and their program experience. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_597539]-identified and only viewed by [CONTACT_597540]. There will be no consequence if trainees do not complete the survey and this will be explained before completing the survey.   EXPECTED BENEFITS Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_789639] 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, improved safety, or technological advances.  All trainees participating in the Professional Development Coaching Program are expected to receive the same benefit, regardless of participation in the surveys; which is increased increased awareness of their accomplishments, increased opportunity for reflection, decreased burnout, improved well-being, increased resiliency, and increased opportunity to set self-directed learning goals.  Additional benefits which are likely, but may be harder to capture in a survey, are increased awareness of where to turn in the event that they are struggling with work, life or professional issues.   EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research. All residents from general surgery, OMFS, urology, OB/GYN, and neurosurgery and all internal medicine first year subspecialty fellows will be enrolled in the study.  All residents who are members of AWS will be invited to participate. Randomization will be carefully done to ensure gender and other demographics are balanced between groups, with the exception of the AWS cohort, which is all women, and in that cohort, we will focus on balancing the remaining demographics.    When people who do not speak English are excluded from participation in the research, provide the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak English should not be denied participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to translate the consent form in different languages and to have an interpreter present. All trainees have exhibited English proficiency at the time of enrollment in the training program.    For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:           Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English          http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/nonengco.htm   
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_789640] of their training year. All trainees and faculty will be asked to complete de-identified surveys at the end of each academic year. These surveys will serve no evaluative purpose in the training program. It will be clearly described that their participation is not mandatory.   Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out-of-pocket expenses related to study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such expenses when funding is availableNone  For guidance, refer to the following Partners policies:           Recruitment of Research Subjects           http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/recruit.htm           Guidelines for Advertisements for Recruiting Subjects          http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/advert.htm           Remuneration for Research Subjects          http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/remun.htm  CONSENT PROCEDURES Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent (i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided. Consent will be obtained during the orientation following an overview of the study, as well as in emails when surveys are sent out.      NOTE: When subjects are unable to give consent due to age (minors) or impaired decision-making capacity, complete the forms for Research Involving Children as Subjects of Research

RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_67319]- line treatment for advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which 
initially results in tumor regression; however, the tumor eventually progresses, a clinical state known as castration -resistant  prostate  cancer  (CRPC)  to which  most  men eventually succumb. The 
taxane  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (docetaxel  and cabazitaxel)  and drugs  targeting  the androgen receptor  (AR) 
signalling pathway (enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate) have been FDA -approved for the 
treatment of CRPC for their proven survival benefit in definitive Phase III clinical trials (2- 7). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_62591], none of them 
induce durable  responses.  
 
Approximately 80% of patients with advanced prostate cancer have metastatic disease that has spread to the bone. The interaction between the tumor and its microenvironment in the bone 
promotes plays a key role  in metastatic growth of prostate cancer. The significance of the 
microenvironment has been confirmed by [CONTACT_62635]: 1) bone - 
homing radiopharmaceutical,  radium -223 (Xofigo); and 2) the prostate  cancer  vaccine,  sipuleucel - 
T (Provenge). Sipuleucel -T and radium -223 prolong survival in advanced prostate cancer  without 
decreasing  serum  prostate -specific antigen  (PSA).  Agents  that target primarily  the tumor would be 
expected to decrease PSA; providing evidence that the above -described drugs target primarily  the 
tumor microenvironment. Unfortunately, in most patients, radium- [ADDRESS_67320]  tumors  are one of the body’s  natural  defense  against  the growth 
and proliferation of cancer cells. However, over time and under pressure from immune attack, 
cancers develop strategies to evade  immune -mediated  killing  allowing  them  to develop  unchecked. 
One such mechanism involves upregulation of surface proteins that deliver inhibitory signals to 
cytotoxic  T cells.  Programmed  cell death  ligand 1 (PD -L1) is one such protein, and is upregulated 
in a broad  range  of cancers  with a high frequency,  with up to 88% expression in some  tumor  types. 
In a number of these cancers, including lung (Mu et al, 2011), renal (Thompson et al, 2005; 
Thompson et al, 2006; Krambeck et al, 2007), pancreatic (Nomi et al, 2007; Loos et al, 2008; 
Wang et al, 2010), ovarian cancer (Hamanishi et al, 2007), and h ematologic malignancies 
(Andorsky et al, 2011;  Brusa  et al, 2013)  tumor cell expression  of PD-L1 is associated  with reduced 
survival and an unfavorable  prognosis. 
Programmed cell death ligand [ADDRESS_67321] immune  system  tumor response. In the lymph  nodes, PD-L1 on antigen- presenting cells binds 
to PD -1 or CD80 on activated T cells and delivers an inhibitory signal to the T cell (Keir et al, 
2008; Park et al, 2010). This results in reduced T -cell activation and fewer activated T cells in 
circulation. In the tumor microenvironment, PD -L1 expr essed on tumor cells binds to PD -1 and 
Protocol 2016- 0769

CD80 on activated T cells reaching the tumor. This delivers an inhibitory signal to those T cells, 
preventing them  from killing  target cancer  cells and protecting  the tumor  from  immune  elimination 
(Zou and Chen, 2008) . 
 
Immune responses directed against tumors are one of the body’s natural defenses against the 
growth and proliferation of cancer cells. T cells play a critical role in antitumor immunity and their  
infiltration  and activity  have  been  linked  to improved  prognosis  in a number  of cancers (Pagès et al, 
2010; Nakano et al, 2001; Suzuki et al, 2011; Burt et al, 2011 ). Immune evasion, primarily through 
suppression of T -cell activity, is now recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer. Such evasion 
can occur via a range of mechanisms including production of suppressive cytokines such as IL -10, 
secretion of chemokines and growth factors that recruit and sustain suppressive regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) and inflammatory macrophages, and expression of inhibitory surface molecules  such as 
B7-H1. Tumor  types  characterized  as being responsive  to immunotherapy -based approaches include  
melanoma  (Weber  et al, 2012), renal  cell carcinoma  (RCC;  McDermott,  2009), bladder cancer 
(Kresowik and Griffith, 2009), and malignant mesothelioma (Bograd et al, 2011). Inhibition  of 
CTLA -4 signaling is a validated  approach  to cancer  therapy, as shown by [CONTACT_62636] 2011 of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62592] (Hodi et al, 2010; Robert et al,  2011).  
 
In general, tumor response rates  to anti -CTLA -4 therapy are low (~10%). However, in patients 
who respond, the responses are generally durable, lasting several months even in patients with 
aggressive tumors such as refractory metastatic melanoma. Because these agents work through 
activati on of the immune system and not by [CONTACT_62637], responses can occur late 
and some patients may have perceived progression of their disease in advance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_62593] a tumor  response.  In some  cases,  early  growth of pre-existing  lesions  or the 
appearance of new lesions may have been due to immune- cell infiltration into the tumor and not 
due to proliferation and extension of neoplastic cells, per se (Wolchok et al, 2009). Overall, 
although the impact on conventionally -defined PFS can be small, durable response or stable 
disease seen in a proportion of patients can lead to significant prolongation of OS. The  melanoma 
data with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62594] a small proportion of patients with an objective 
response  had significant  prolongation of OS, supporting the development  of this class of agents  in 
other  tumors.  Although Phase [ADDRESS_67322] activity  of

tremelimumab in melanoma (Kirkwood et al, 2010; Ribas et al, 2013). In a large Phase 3 
randomized study comparing tremelimumab with dacarbazine (DTIC)/temozolomide in patients 
with advanced melanoma, the reported median OS in the final analysis was 12.58 m onths for 
tremelimumab versus 10.71 months for DTIC/temozolomide (HR = 1.1416, p = 0.1272; Ribas et al, 2013).  
 
Targeting CTLA -4 with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62595] 1 and 2 CRPC trials demonstrated clinical activity 
(Hodi et al 2010; Schiller et al 2002; Wolchok et a l 2013). However, in a phase 3 trial comparing 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62596], ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62597] (Hodi et al 2010).  
 
Post hoc analyses revealed that treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62598], but without visceral metastases (Hodi et al 
2010). Furthermore, studies of other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, sipuleucel -T, poxvirus -based vaccine 
[PROSTVAC]) for CRPC have demonstrated that the extent of tumor burden influences outcome (Mu et al 2011; Nakano et al 2001). Therefore, immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_62599]ïve  CRPC patients without visceral 
metastases who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.  
 
We investigated whether the lack of significant therapeutic efficacy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62600] a number of malignancies, including prostate cancer, melanoma, RCC, and 
bladder cancer. Prostate cancer, unlike the other malignancies, has very few immune infiltrates and 
low tumor expression of PD -L1; therefore,  it is a relatively non -immunogenic tumor. Interestingly,  
there  is data from three  clinical  trials  suggesting that higher  tumor expression  of PD- L1 correlates 
with an increased  likelihood of responding to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_62601]-1 or PD-L1 (Mu et  al 2011). 
Thus, it is not surprising that in a phase  1 study targeting  PD-1 (nivolumab),  treatment was 
ineffective in patients with CRPC (0/17 responses) (Drake et al  2013).  
 
However,  our observations demonstrate PD -L1 expression is an adaptive response to CT LA-4 
blockade  and support  the hypothesis  that CTLA- 4 plus PD-1 inhibition will be an effective strategy 
to induce anti -tumor responses in patients with CRPC. We recently observed that following 
treatment with 2 doses  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62602] a markedly  significant  increase  in tumor- infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) and enhanced PD -1 and PD -L1 expression within the prostate tumor 
microenvironment. This suggests that CTLA -4 blockade has the potential of making prostate 
cancer immunogenic, but also t hat resistance to CTLA -4 blockade may be attributed to the PD - 
1/PD -L1 signaling pathway. Thus, simultaneously targeting CTLA -[ADDRESS_67323] confirm this hypothesis in preclinical 
studies (I wai et al  2002).

1.1.1 Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_62603], and, under some 
circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors (Dunn et al 2004). 
Studies in mouse models of transplantable tumors have demonstrated that manipulation of co-  
stimulatory  or co-inhibitory  signals  can amplify  T-cell responses  against  tumors  (Dunn et al 2004). 
This amplification may be accomplished by [CONTACT_27640]- inhibitory molecules, such as cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte -associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD -1), from binding 
with their ligands, B7 or B7- H1 (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]).  
 
1.1.2 Durvalumab 
 
The non-clinical  and clinical  experience is fully  described  in the current  version of the durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure (see PDOL  Appendices).  
 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa 
subclass that inhibits binding of PD -L1 and is being developed by [CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune for 
use in the treatment of cancer. (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of [COMPANY_008]; [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune will be referred to as [COMPANY_008] throughout this document.) As 
durvalumab is an engineered mAb, it does not induce ant ibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity or 
complement -dependent cytotoxicity. The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab is 
interference of the interaction of PD -L1. 
 
PD-L1 is expressed  in a broad range  of cancers with a high frequency, up to 88%  in some types  of 
cancers. In a number of these cancers, including lung, the expression of PD -L1 is associated with 
reduced survival and an unfavorable prognosis. In lung cancer, only 12% of patients with tumors 
expressing PD -L1 survived for more than 3 years, co mpared with 20% of patients with tumors 
lacking PD -L1 (Mu et al 2011). Based on these findings, an anti -PD-L1 antibody could be used 
therapeutically  to enhance  anti-tumor immune  responses  in patients  with cancer.  Results of several 
non-clinical studies using mouse tumormodels support this hypothesis, where antibodies directed 
against  PD-L1 or its receptor  PD-1 showed anti -tumor  activity  (Hirano  et al 2005, Iwai  et al 2002, 
Okudaira et al 2009, Zhang et al  2008). 
 
Durvalumab  has been  given  to humans  as part of ongoing studies  as a single  drug or in combination 
with other drugs As of the DCO dates (15Apr2015 to 12Jul2015, durvalumab IB version 8.0), a 
total of 1,[ADDRESS_67324] been enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing durvalumab clinical studies, 
including 20 sponsored and 10 collaborative studies. Of the 1,883 subjects, 1,279 received 
durvalumab monotherapy, 440 received durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab or other 
anticancer  agents, 14 received  other  agents  (1 gefitinib,  13 MEDI6383), and [ADDRESS_67325] been completed or terminated prematurely due to toxicity. 
As of 09Feb2015, PK data were available for 378 subjects in the dose -escalation and dose - 
expansion phases of Study  CD-ON-durvalumab- 1108 following  treatment with  durvalumab 0.1 to 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). The maximum observed 
concentration  (C
max) increased  in an approximately dose-proportional manner  over the dose range 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 12 of 103  
of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg. The area under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 14 days (AUC 0-14) 
increased in a greater than dose- proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg and 
increased dose- proportio nally at ≥ 3 mg/kg. These results suggest durvalumab exhibits nonlinear 
PK likely  due to saturable target -mediated  CL at doses < 3 mg/kg and approaches linearity  at doses  
≥ 3 mg/kg. Near  complete  target  saturation  (soluble  programmed  cell death  ligand 1 [sPD -L1] and 
membrane bound) is expected with durvalumab ≥ 3 mg/kg Q2W. Exposures after multiple doses 
showed accumulation  consistent  with PK parameters estimated  from the first dose. In addition, PK 
simulations indicate that following durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W dosing, > 90% of subjects are 
expected to maintain PK exposure ≥ 40 µg/mL throughout the dosing interval.  
 
As of 09Feb2015, a total of 388 subjects provided samples for ADA analysis. Only 8 of 388 
subjects  ([ADDRESS_67326]  each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg cohorts, and 4 subjects in 10 mg/kg cohort)  were 
ADA positive with an impact on PK/pharmacodynamics in [ADDRESS_67327] in the 3 mg/kg cohort.  
 
1.1.3 Tremelimumab  
 
The non- clinical and clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the 
tremelimumab Investigator’s Brochure (See PDOL appendices).  
 
Tremelimumab is an IgG [ADDRESS_67328] the cytotoxic T -lymphocyte - 
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) also known as CD152 (cluster of differentiation 152). This is an 
immunomodula tory therapy (IMT) that is being developed by [CONTACT_62638].  
 
Binding of CTLA -4 to its target ligands (B7 -1 and B7- 2) provides a negative regulatory signal, 
which limits T -cell activation. Anti- CTLA -4 inhibitors antagonize the binding of CTLA -4 to B7 
ligands and enhance human T -cell activation as demonstrated by [CONTACT_47505] (interleukin 
[IL]- 2 and interferon [IFN] gamma) production in vitro in whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear  cell (PBMC)  cultures  (Tarhini  and Kirkwood 2008). In addition, blockade  of CTLA - 
4 binding to B7 by [CONTACT_14181] -CTLA -4 antibodies results in markedly enhanced T -cell activation and 
anti-tumor activity in animal models, including killing of established murine solid tumors and 
inducti on of protective  anti-tumor immunity.  (Refer to the tremelimumab  IB, Edition 6.0, for more 
information.) Therefore, it is expected that treatment with an anti -CTLA -[ADDRESS_67329] em, increasing anti - 
tumor activity in patients with solid  tumors.  
An extensive program of non- clinical and clinical studies has been conducted for tremelimumab 
both as monotherapy and combination therapy with conventional anticancer agents to support various cancer indications using different dose schedules.  
 
As of the data cutoff dates (1 November 2015 for monotherapy studies and 15 April 2015 to12 July 2015 for combination therapy studies), [ADDRESS_67330] been treated in the ongoing blinded Phase IIb monotherapy Study D4880C00003 [DETERMINE]). In the 3rd 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 13 of 103  
ongoing monotherapy study (D4884C00001), no patients have been treated as of the data cutoff. 
In addition, approximately [ADDRESS_67331] 
received tremelimumab in combination with other anticancer agents in these studies. Details on the safety  profile  of tremelimumab  monotherapy are summarized  in Section  0. Refer  to the current 
tremelimumab IB (version 6.0) for a complete summary of non -clinical and clinical information; 
see Section 6.6 for guidance on management of tremelimumab- related  toxicities.  
 
Tremelimumab exhibi ted a biphasic PK profile with a long terminal phase half- life of 22 days. 
Overall, a low incidence of ADAs (<6%) was observed for treatment with tremelimumab.  
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_67332] additive or synergistic activity (Pardoll 
2012) because the mechanisms of action of CTLA -4 and PD -1 are non- redundant; therefore, 
[COMPANY_008]  is also investigating  the use of durvalumab + tremelimumab  combination  therapy for 
the treatment of  cancer.  
 
Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose -escalation study to establish safety, PK/PDx, and 
preliminary anti -tumor activity of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy in patients 
with advanced  NSCLC.  The dosing schedule  utilized  is durvalumab every 2 weeks (q2w)  or every 
4 weeks (q4w)  up to Week  50 and 48 (12 months), combined with tremelimumab  q4w up to Week 
24 for 7 doses  then every  12 weeks for 2 additional  doses  for up to 12 months. The study is ongoing 
and continues to accrue.  
 
Study  D4190C00006:  As of 20Feb2015, durvalumab PK (n = 55) and tremelimumab  PK (n = 26) 
data were available from 10 cohorts (1a, 2a, 3a, 3b, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 8, and 9) following durvalumab 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) or Q2W dosing in combination with tremelimumab Q4W regimens. An 
approximately dose-proportional increase  in PK  exposure  (Cmax and area  under  the concentration - 
time curve from 0 to 28 days [AUC 0-28]) of both durvalumab and tremelimumab was observed  
over the dose range of 3 to 15 mg/kg durvalumab Q4W and 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W. 
Exposures following multiple doses demonstrated accum ulation consistent with PK parameters 
estimated  from  the first dose. It  is to be noted  that steady  state PK parameters  are based  on limited 
numbers of subjects. The observed PK exposures of durvalumab and tremelimumab following 
combination were consistent with respective monotherapy data, indicating no PK interaction 
between these [ADDRESS_67333] treatment. There was no clear relationship between ADA and the 
dose of either durvalumab or tremelimumab,  and no obvious  association  between  ADA and safety 
or efficacy.  
 
Durvalumab  has also been  combined with other  anticancer  agents,  including gefitinib,  dabrafenib, 
and trametinib. To date, no PK interaction has been observed between durvalumab and these 
Protocol 2016- 0769

agents.  
 
1.2 Research  hypothesis  
 
To determine whether durvalumab plus tremelimumab can be safely administered and may 
induce augmented immunological and clinical responses in patients with metastatic castration - 
resistant prostate cancer.  
 
1.3 Rationale for conducting this  study  
 
As an antibody, that blocks the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, durvalumab may 
relieve PD-L1-dependent  immunosuppressive  effects  and, therefore,  enhance the cytotoxic  activity 
of anti -tumor T -cells. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_62639] -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_67334], which provide early evidence of clinical activity and a 
manageable safety profile (Brahmer et al 2012, Topalian et al 2012). Responses have been 
observed in patients with PD -L1-positive tu mors and patients with PD -L1-negative tumors. In 
addition, durvalumab monotherapy has shown durable responses in NSCLC in Study 1108 (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
 
The rationale for combining durvalumab and tremelimumab is that the mechanisms of CTLA -[ADDRESS_67335] additive or 
synergistic activity (Pardoll 2012). In fact, combining immunotherapy agents has been shown to result in improved response rates (RRs) relative to monotherapy. For example, the concurrent 
administration of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62604] (ORRs) than those obtained with single -agent therapy.  
Importantly, responses appeared to be deep and durable (Wolchok et al 2013). Similar results  have 
been observed in an ongoing study of durvalumab + tremelimumab in NSCLC (Wolchok et al 2013).  
 
1.3.1 Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy dose  rationale  
 
The durvalumab + tremelimumab doses and regimen selected for this study are based on the goal of selecting an optimal combination dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab that would yield 
sustained target suppression (sPD -L1), demonstrate promising efficacy, and have an acceptable 
safety profile.  
 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics data  
Study D4190C00006 included dose cohorts  with both a Q4W  and a Q2W  schedule  of durvalumab 
in combination with a Q4W schedule of tremelimumab. The Q4W schedule was included toalign 
with the Q4W dosing of tremelimumab. PK simulations from durvalumab monotherapy data indicated  that a similar  area under  the plasma drug concentration -time curve  at steady  state (AUC
ss; 
4 weeks) was expected following both 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing with 
durvalumab. The observed durvalumab PK data from the D4190C00006 study were in line with 
the predicted monotherapy PK data developed pre -clinically and in line with that seen in the  first- 
time-in-human (FTIH), single agent study (CD -ON-MEDI4736- 1108) in patients with advanced 
solid tumors. This demonstrates similar exposure of durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4W and 10 mg/kg Q2W, with no alterations in PK when durvalumab and tremelimumab (doses ranging from 1 to 3 
mg/kg) are dosed together. While the median maximum plasma concentration at steady state 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020

(Cmax,ss) is expected  to be higher  with 20 mg/kg Q4W  (approximately  1.5 fold) and median  trough 
concentration at steady state (C trough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(approximately 1.25 fold), this is not expected to impact the overall safety and efficacy profile, 
based on existing preclinical and clinical  data.  
 
Monotonic increases in PDx activity were observed with increasing doses of tremelimumab 
relative to the activity observed in patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy. There was 
evidence of augmented PDx activity relative to durvalumab monotherapywith combination doses 
contai ning 1 mg/kg tremelimumab, inclusive of both the 15 and 20 mg/kg durvalumab plus 1 
mg/kg tremelimumab combinations.  
 
Clinical data  
In Study D4190C00006 various dose combinations have been explored, with doses of 
tremelimumab ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg and doses of durvalumab ranging from 3 to 20 mg/kg. 
Tremelimumab was given on a Q4W schedule whilst durvalumab was explored in both a Q4W 
and Q2W schedule, with the goal of identifying the dose combination that best optimizes therisk: 
benefit profile in an acceptable range of PK and pharmacodynamic values.  
Patients treated with doses of tremelimumab above 1 mg/kg had a higher rate of adverse events (AEs), including discontinuations due to AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and severe AEs. Between 
the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab and 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohorts treated at the Q2W schedule, the number of patients reporting any AE, ≥ 
Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment -related AEs was higher in the 10 mg/kg durvalumab +  
3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort than the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort. 
A similar pattern was noted in the Q4W regimens, suggesting that, as the dose of tremelimumab 
increased above 1 mg/kg, a higher rate of treatment -related events may be anticipated. Further, 
the SAEs frequently attributed to immunotherapy, pneumonitis, colitis and other immune mediated events, were more commonly seen in cohorts using either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of 
tremelimumab compared to the 1 -mg/kg dose cohorts. Together, these data suggest that a 
combination using a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg appeared to minimize the rate of toxicity when combined with durvalumab. As a result, all combination doses utilizing either the 3 or 10-  
mg/kg doses of tremelimumab were eliminated in the final dose selection.  
 
In contrast, cohorts assessing higher doses of durvalumab with a constant dose of tremelimumab 
did not show  an increase  in the rate of AEs.  The data suggested  that increasing  doses  of durvalumab 
may not impact the safety of the combination as much as the tremelimumab dose. Further, safety data between the 10- mg/kg and 20- mg/kg cohorts were similar, with no change in safety events 
with increasing dose of  durvalumab.  
 
In Study D4190C00006, of all treatment cohorts, the cohort of pa tients treated in the 20 mg/kg 
durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab group had a tolerable safety profile, but still showedstrong evidence of clinical activity. No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in this cohort.  
 
Preliminary clinical activity of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination did not appear to change with increasing doses of tremelimumab. The 15-  and 20- mg/kg durvalumab Q4W cohorts 
demonstrated objective responses at all doses of tremelimumab, and increasing doses of 
tremelimumab did not provide deeper or more rapid responses.

Efficacydata suggested that the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort may 
demonstrate equivalent clinical activity to other dose combinations. Of the 14 patients in this 
cohort, there were 4 pat ients (29%) with PR, 4 patients (29%) with SD, and 2 patients (14%)  with 
PD. Two patients were not evaluable for response. 
 
Altogether, the data suggested that a 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose 
combination should be selected for further development.

and clinical information on the durvalumab + tremelimumab combination, including safety,

1.3.2 Rationale for 4 cycles of combination therapy followed by 
[CONTACT_62640]- term follow up on melanoma patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], an anti -CTLA -4 targeting 
antibody (dosed every 3 weeks [q3w] for 4 doses and then discontinued), shows that patients responding to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62605] -term benefit, with a 3 -year OS rate of approximately 22%. 
Furthermore,  the survival  curve  in this population  reached  a plateau  at 3 years  and was maintained 
through 10 years of follow up (Schadendorf et al  2013). 
 
Similar data have been presented for other anti -PD-1/PD -L1 targeting antibodies:  
 
Nivolumab (anti -PD-1) was dosed q2w for up to 96 weeks in a large Phase I dose -escalation and 
expansion study, and showed responses were maintained for a median of 22.94 months for 
melano ma (doses  0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg), 17 months  for NSCLC (doses  1, 3, and 10 mg/kg),  and 
12.9 months for renal cell carcinoma patients (doses 1 and 10 mg/kg) at the time of data analysis  
 
(Hodi et al 2014, Brahmer et al 2014, Drake et al 2013). Furthermore, r esponses were maintained 
beyond treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who stopped nivolumab treatment (either due to protocol specified end of treatment, complete response [CR], or toxicity) for up to 
56 weeks at the time of data analysis ( Topalian et al 2014).  
 
MPDL3280a (anti -PD-L1) and the combination of nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], in which patients 
were dosed for a finite time period and responses maintained beyond treatment discontinuation 
have been reported (Herbst et al 2013, Wolchok e t al 2013).  
 
Similar long term results  may be expected  with use of other  immune -mediated  cancer  therapeutics 
including anti -CTLA -4 antibodies such as tremelimumab, anti PD -L1 antibodies such as 
durvalumab, or the combination of the  two. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Durvalumab monotherapy dose rationale  
 
A durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W is supported by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -vitro data, non- clinical activity, clinical 
PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, and activity data from Study 1108 in patients with advanced 
solid tumors and from a Phase I trial performed in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumor 
(D4190C00002). 
Protocol 2016- 0769

Page 17 of 103  
 
PK/Pharmacodynamic data  
Based on available PK/pharmacodynamic data from ongoing Study 1108 with doses ranging from  
0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W, durvalumab exhibi ted non- linear (dose -dependent) PK 
consistent with target -mediated drug disposition. The PK approached linearity at ≥3 mg/kg Q2W, 
suggesting near complete  target  saturation  (membrane -bound and sPD-L1), and further  shows  that 
the durvalumab dosing frequency can be adapted to a particular regimen given the linearity  seen 
at doses higher than 3 mg/kg. The expected half -life with doses ≥3 mg/kg Q2W is approximately 
[ADDRESS_67336] experienced immune- complex disease following exposure  to 
durvalumab (For further information on immunogenicity, please see the c urrent IB).  
 
Data from Study D4190C00006 (Phase I trial in NSCLC patients using the combination of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab) also show an approximately dose -proportional increase in PK 
exposure for durvalumab over the dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg durvalu mab Q4W or Q2W. (For 
further information on PK observations in Study 006, please see the current IB).  
 
The observed durvalumab PK data from  the combination study  were  well in line with the predicted 
monotherapy PK data (5th median and 95th percentiles) for  a Q4W  regimen. 
 
A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1108 (doses=0.1 to 10 mg/kg 
Q2W or 15 mg/kg (Fairman et al 2014). Multiple simulations indicate that a similar overall 
exposure  is expected  following  both 10 mg/kg Q2W  and 20 mg/kg Q4W  regimens,  as represented 
by [CONTACT_62641]  (4 weeks).  Median  Cmax,ss is expected  to be higher  with 20 mg/kg  Q4W (~1.5 fold)  and 
median Ctrough,ss is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (~1.25 fold). Clinical activity with the 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing regim en is anticipated to be consistent with 10 mg/kg Q2W with the 
proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W expected to (a) achieve complete target saturation in majority  of patients;  (b) account  for anticipated  variability  in PK, pharmacodynamics,  and clinical 
activity  in diverse  cancer  populations;  (c) maintain  sufficient PK exposure  in case of ADA  impact; 
and (d) achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal antitumor activity in animal models. 
 
Given the similar area under the plasma  drug concentration- time curve (AUC) and modest 
differences in median peak and trough levels at steady state, the observation that both regimens 
maintain complete sPD -L1 suppression at trough, and the available clinical data, the 20 mg/kg 
Q4W and 10 mg/kg Q2W regimens are expected to have similar efficacy and safety profiles, supporting further development with a dose of 20 mg/kg Q4W. 
 
Clinical data

information including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics at the 20mg/kg Q4W regimen.

1.4 Benefit/risk and ethical  assessment  
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_67337] time in -human, single -agent study (Study 1108) in patients with advanced solidtumors. Data 
from Study 1108 were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2014 Congress. 
Overall,  456 of 694 subjects treated  with durvalumab 10 mg/kg  Q2W  were  evaluable  for response 
(defined as having ≥ 24 weeks follow -up, measurable disease at baseline, and ≥ 1 follow -up scan, 
or discontinued due to disease progression or death without any follow -up scan). In PD -L1 
unselected patients, the objective response rate (ORR), based on investigator assessment per Response  Evaluation Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal  melanoma 
(n = 23) to 20.0% in bladder ca ncer (n = 15), and disease control rate at 24 weeks (DCR -24w) 
ranged from  4.2%  in triple -negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC;  n = 24) to 39.1%  in advanced  cutaneous 
melanoma (n = 23). PD -L1 status was known for [ADDRESS_67338] for bladder cancer, advanced cutaneous 
melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 3 each, 33.3% each), N SCLC (n = 86, 26.7%), 
and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN; n = 22, 18.2%). In the PD -L1- 
positive subset, DCR -24w was highest in advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 3, 66.7%), NSCLC 
(n = 86, 36.0%), HCC and bladder  cancer  (n = 3 each,  33.3%  each),  and SCCHN (n = 22, 18.2%).  
 
Tremelimumab  
 
In a single -arm, Phase II study (Study A3671008) of tremelimumab administered at 15 mg/kg 
every 90 days to patients with refractory melanoma, an RR of 7% and a median OS of 10 months 
in the second -line set ting (as compared to approximately [ADDRESS_67339] supportive care 
reported from a retrospective analysis; (Korn et al 2008) were observed (Kirkwood et al2010). In a randomized, open- label, first -line Phase III study of tremelimumab (administered at 15 mg/kg 
every 90 days) versus chemotherapy (dacarbazine or temozolomide) in advanced melanoma (Study A3671009), results of the final analysis showed an RR of 11% and a median OS of  
12.[ADDRESS_67340] chemotherapy; 
however, these results  were  not statistically  significant  (Ribas  et al 2013).  Additionally,  a Phase II 
maintenance study (Study A3671015) in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had responded 
or remained stable failed to achieve statistical significance. The primary endpoint of PFS at 3 months was 22.7% in the tremelimumab arm (15 mg/kg) compared wit h 11.9% in the best 
supportive care arm (Study  A3671015).

Durvalumab + tremelimumab  
 
The preclinical  and clinical  justification  for this combination as noted in Section  1.1.4 also supports 
the synergy of this combination. Available data, such as those presented by (Wolchok et al  2013), 
suggest that the combination of agents targeting PD -1/PD -L1 and CTLA -[ADDRESS_67341] profound and 
durable benefits in patients with melanoma (Wolchok et al 2013). Of the [ADDRESS_67342] 16 weeks of follow -up were evaluable for response 
(defined as measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 follow -up scan; this included 
discontinuations due to disease progression or death without follow -up scan). Of the 63 evaluable 
subjects,  17 (27%)  had a best overall  response  of PR, 14 (22%)  had SD, 22 (35%)  had PD, and 10 
(16%) were not evaluable. The ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR) was 27% and the 
DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was 49% as assessed by [CONTACT_393]  v1.1.  
 
Current experience with single -agent IMT studies suggests that clinical responses may be restricted 
to a subset of any given patient population and that it might be beneficial to enrich the patient 
population by [CONTACT_62642]. To date, no assay has been established 
or validated, and no single approach has proven accurate, for patient enrichment for IMTs. 
However, independent data from multiple sources using different assays and scoring methods 
suggests that PD -L1 expression on tumor cells and/or tumor infiltrating cells may be associated 
with greater clinical benefit.  
 
Data from ongoing studies with durva lumab and other agents targeting the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway 
suggest, as  shown in a number  of tumor types  (eg, NSCLC,  renal  cell carcinoma,  and melanoma), 
that monotherapy may be more  efficacious (in terms  of ORR)  in patients  who are PD-L1-positive.  
 
Given these findings, a number of ongoing studies are assessing the activity of agents in patients 
with PD -L1–positive tumors. There is also an unmet medical need in patients with PD -L1– 
negative  tumors  that needs  to be addressed.  Data,  as of 27 January 2015 from  Study 006 show  that 
with the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab, the ORR can be increased to 25% in patients 
with PD -L1 negative NSCLC. As patients with PD -L1 positive disease can also have an increase 
in ORR, from 25% with dur valumab monotherapy, to 36% with the combination of durvalumab 
and tremelimumab, the study will enroll all patients with NSCLC, with an emphasis on those 
determined to be PD -L1 negative.  
 
1.4.2  Potential  risks 
Durvalumab 
Potential risks, based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab and related molecules, include 
immune -mediated reactions, such as enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity,  
endocrinopathy, pneumonitis, and neuropathy or neurologic  events. Additional  important  potential 
risks  include  infusion -related  reactions,  hypersensitivity,  anaphylaxis  or serious  allergic  reactions, 
serious infections, and immune complex disease.

Study CD -ON-durvalumab- 1108: The safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy in the 694 
subjects  with advanced  solid  tumors  treated  at 10 mg/kg Q2W  in Study CD-ON-durvalumab-  [ADDRESS_67343] received durvalumab 
monotherapy (not including subjects treated with blinded investigational product) across the 
clinical  development  program.  The majority  of treatment- related  AEs were  manageable with  dose 
delays, symptomatic treatment, and in the case of events suspected to have an immune basis, the use of established  treatment guidelines  for immune -mediated  toxicity.  As of 07May2015, among the 
694 subjects  treated  with durvalumab  10 mg/kg  Q2W  in Study  CD-ON-durvalumab - 1108, a total 
of 378 subjects (54.5%) experienced a treatment -related AE, with the most frequent (occurring in 
≥ 5% of subjects) being fatigue (17.7%), nausea (8.6%), diarrhea (7.3%), decreased appetite (6.8%), pruritus (6.3%), rash (6.1%), and vomiting (5.0%). A majority of the treatment - related 
AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity with ≥ Grade 3  events occurring in 65 subjects (9.4%). 
Treatment -related ≥ Grade 3 events reported in 3 or more subjects (≥ 0.4%) were fatigue (12 
subjects, 1.7%); increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 7 subjects, 1.0%); increased  gamma - 
glutamyltransferase (GGT; 6  subjects, 0.9%); increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 5 
subjects, 0.7%); and colitis, vomiting, decreased appetite, and hyponatremia (3 subjects, 0.4% 
each). Six subjects had treatment -related Grade 4 AEs (upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 
increased AST, dyspnea, neutropenia, colitis, diarrhea, and pneumonitis) and [ADDRESS_67344] had a 
treatment- related Grade 5 event (pneumonia). Treatment -related serious adverse events (SAEs) 
that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects were colitis and pneumonitis (3 subjects each). A majority of the 
treatment- related  SAEs  were  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  and resolved  with or without  sequelae.  AEs that 
resulted  in permanent  discontinuation of durvalumab were  considered as treatment related  in 
18 subjects (2.6%), with colitis being the most frequent treatment- related AE resulting in 
discontinuation (3 subjects). A majority of the treatment- related AEs resulting in discontinuation 
of durvalumab were ≥ Grade 3 in severity and resolved with or without sequelae.  
 
Study  D4191C00003/ATLANTIC:  The safety  profile  of durvalumab  monotherapy  in Study CD- 
ON-durvalumab- 1108 is generally consistent with that of Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC in 
subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non -small -cell lung canc er (NSCLC) treated with 
durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. As of 05May2015, 264 of 303 subjects (87.1%) reported any AE in Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC. Overall, events reported in ≥ 10% of subjects were dyspnea 
(18.8%), fatigue (17.8%), decreased appetite (17.5%), cough (14.2%), pyrexia (12.2%), asthenia 
(11.9%), and nausea (11.2%). Nearly two- thirds of the subjects experienced AEs that were Grade 
1 or 2 in severity and manageable by [CONTACT_62643] 2016- 0769

durvalumab study protocols. Grade  3 or higher  AEs were  reported  in 107 of 303 subjects (35.3%). 
A total of 128 subjects (42.2%) reported AEs that were considered by [CONTACT_62644]. Treatment -related AEs (all grades) reported in ≥ 2% of subjects were 
decreased appetite (6.6%); fatigue (5.9%); asthenia (5.0%); nausea (4.6%); pruritus (4.3%); diarrhea, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and pyrexia (3.3% each); rash (2.6%); weight 
decreased (2.3%); and vomiting (2.0%). Tre atment -related Grade 3 AEs reported in ≥ 2 subjects 
were pneumonitis (3 subjects) and increased GGT (2 subjects). There was no treatment -related 
Grade 4 or 5 AEs. Ninety- four of 303 subjects (31.0%) reported any SAE. SAEs that occurred in 
≥ 1.0% of subject s were dyspnea (6.6%); pleural effusion, general physical health deterioration 
(2.3%  each);  pneumonia  (2.0%);  hemoptysis, pulmonary embolism (1.3%  each);  and pneumonitis, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], disease progression (1.0% each). Nine subjects had an SAE considered by [CONTACT_62645].  Each  treatment- related  SAE  occurred  in [ADDRESS_67345]  each with 
the exception of pneumonitis, which occurred in 3 subjects. Fifteen of 303 subjects (5.0%) have died due to an AE (pneumonia [3 subjects]; general  physical health deterioration, disease 
progression, hemoptysis, dyspnea [2 subjects each]; pulmonary sepsis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], cardiopulmonary arrest [verbatim term (VT)], hepatic failure, and sepsis [[ADDRESS_67346] each]). None 
of these events was considered related to durvalumab. Twenty- three of 303 subjects (7.6%) 
permanently discontinued durvalumab treatment due to AEs. Events that led to discontinuationof durvalumab in ≥ [ADDRESS_67347]  each.  
 
Tremelimumab  
 
Potential risks, based on the mechanism of action of tremelimumab and related molecules 
(ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) include potentially immune -mediated gastrointestinal (GI) events including 
enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, abdominal pain, dehydration, nausea and v omiting, and 
decreased appetite (anorexia); dermatitis including urticaria, skin exfoliation, and dry skin; 
endocrinopathies including hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyperthyroidism and 
hypothyroidism; hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis and increased serum ALT and AST; 
pancreatitis including autoimmune pancreatitis and lipase and amylase elevation; respi[INVESTIGATOR_62606] (ILD); nervous system events  including 
encephalitis,  peripheral  motor  and sensory  neuropathies, and Guillain -Barré  syndrome;  cytopenias 
including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia; infusion- related reactions; anaphylaxis; 
and serious  allergic  reactions.  The profile  of AEs and the spectrum  of event  severity  have  rema ined 
stable across the tremelimumab clinical program and are consistent with the pharmacology of the 
target.  To date,  no tumor type or stage  appears to be associated  with unique  AEs (except  for vitiligo 
that appears to be confined to patients with melanoma). Overall, 944 of the 973 patients (97.0%) treated with tremelimumab monotherapy as of the data cutoff date of  12

November 2014 (for all studies except D4190C00006 that has a cutoff date of [ADDRESS_67348] been treated in the ongoing blinded Phase IIb Study 
D4880C00003)  experienced  at least 1 AE. The events  resulted  in discontinuation  of tremelimumab 
in 10.0% of patients, were serious in 36.5%, were Grade ≥3 in severity in 49.8%, were fatal in  
67.7%, and were considered to be treatment related in 79.1% of patients. The frequency of any AEs and Grade ≥3 AEs was generally similar across the tremelimumab dose groups. However, a 
higher percentage of patients in the 10 mg/kg every 28 days and 15 mg/ kg every 90 days groups 
compared with the All Doses <10 mg/kg group experienced treatment -related AEs, SAEs, AEs 
resulting in discontinuation of investigational product (IP), and deaths.  
 
Durvalumab + tremelimumab  
 
No safety  studies  in animals have  been  performed  combining  tremelimumab  with durvalumab. As 
both CTLA -[ADDRESS_67349] mechanisms of actions that enhance activation of immune cells, 
their potential to induce cytokine release was tested in a whole -blood assay system. Durvalumab 
and tremelimumab, either alone or in combination, did not induce cytokine release in blood from any donor.  
 
Study D4190C00006: The safety profile of durvalumab and tremelimumab combination therapy in the 102 subjects with advanced NSCLC in Study D4190C00006 is general ly consistent with that  
observed across 177 subjects treated  with durvalumab and tremelimumab  combination  therapy (not 
including subjects treated with blinded investigational product). As of 15Apr2015, 95 of 102 
subjects (93.1%) reported at least 1 AE. All  subjects in the tremelimumab 3 and 10 mg/kg dose 
cohorts experienced AEs; subjects in the durvalumab 20 mg/kg and tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W 
cohort  experienced  the lowest  AE rate (77.8%). Treatment -related  AEs were  reported in 74 of 102 
subjects (72.6%), with events occurring in > 10% of subjects being diarrhea (27.5%), fatigue 
(22.5%), increased  amylase and pruritus  (14.7%  each),  rash (12.7%), colitis  (11.8%), and increased 
lipase  (10.8%). Treatment -related  ≥ Grade  3 AEs reported in ≥ 5% of subje cts were  colitis  (8.8%), 
diarrhea (7.8%), and increased lipase (5.9%). Five subjects reported treatment-  related Grade 4 
events (sepsis, increased ALT, and increased AST in [ADDRESS_67350]; increased amylase in 2 subjects; myasthenia gravis  in [ADDRESS_67351];  and pericardial  effusion  in [ADDRESS_67352])  and 2 subjects had treatment - 
related Grade 5 events (polymyositis and an uncoded event of neuromuscular disorder [VT]); the Grade  [ADDRESS_67353].  There  were  2 
subjects (both in the MEDI4736 20 mg/kg + tremelimumab 3 mg/kg Q4W cohort) with dose - 
limiting toxicities (DLTs): [ADDRESS_67354] with Grade 3 increased amylase and Grade 4 increased lipase. Fifty -six subjects (54.9%) reported SAEs, with 
events  occurring in > 5% of subjects  being colitis  (9.8%)  and diarrhea  (7.8%).  Thirty - six subjects 
(35.3%) experienced treatment -related SAEs. Twenty -seven subjects (26.5%) permanently 
discontinued treatment due to AEs. Treatment -related  AEs resulting in discontinuation in ≥ 2 
subjects were colitis (7 subjects), pneumonitis (5 subjects), diarrhea (3

subjects), and increased AST (2 subjects).Additional  safety results from this study are presented 
in Sec tion 0 and the durvalumab IB. 
 
In the literature (Wolchok et al 2013), using the combination of the same class of drugs (eg, anti -
PD-1 and anti -CTLA4 antibodies), specificall y nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a study  involving 
patients with malignant melanoma, the safety profile of this combination had shown occurrences 
of AEs assessed by [CONTACT_62646] -related in 93% of treated patients, with the most 
frequent  events  being rash (55%  of patients),  pruritus  (47%  of patients),  fatigue  (38%  of patients), 
and diarrhea (34% of patients). Grade 3 or 4 AEs, regardless of causality, were noted in 72% of 
patients,  with Grade  3 or 4 events  assessed  by[CONTACT_62647]- related  in 53%.  The most 
frequent of these Grade 3 or 4 events assessed by [CONTACT_62646] - related include 
increased lipase (in 13% of patients), AST (in 13%), and ALT levels (in 11%). Frequent Grade 3 
or 4 selected AEs assessed by [CONTACT_62646] -related in the combination therapy 
included hepatic  events (in 15% of patients),  GI events (in 9%),  and renal  events (in 6%).  Isolated 
cases of pneumonitis and uveitis were also  observed. 
 
Fixed Dosing for durvalumab and tremelimumab  
 
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from a Phase 1 
study ( study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid tumors ). 
Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight (W T) on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_27643] (5th, 
median  and 95th percentiles)  using the population PK  model. A fixed  dose of  750 mg was selected 
to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were 
simulated using body WT distribution of 40–[ADDRESS_67355] variability with fixed dosing regimen.  
 
Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 
through Phase 3 ( N=654; doses= 0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or Q90D; metastatic melanoma) [Wang 
et al. 2014]. Population PK model indicated minor impact of body WT on PK of tremelimumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The WT-based  (1 mg/kg  Q4W)  and fixed  dosing (75 mg/kg Q4W; based  on 
median body WT of ~75 kg) regimens were compared using predicted PK concentrations (5th, 
median  and 95th percentiles)  using population PK model  in a simulated  population of [ADDRESS_67356]  been  reported by [CONTACT_2312]  [Ng et al 2006,  Wang  et al. 2009, Zhang et al, 2012, 
Narwal et al 2013]. Wang and colleagues investigated [ADDRESS_67357] variability in 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters (Zhang et al 2012). 
 
A fixed  dosing approach is preferred  by [CONTACT_62648]. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure a nd variability, we 
considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a 
fixed dose of 750 mg Q2W durvalumab (equivalent to 10 mg/kg Q2W), 1500 mg Q4W 
durvalumab (equivalent  to 20 mg/kg Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W  tremelimu mab (equivalent  to 1 mg/kg 
Q4W) is included in the current  study. 
 
Fixed dosing of durvalumab and tremelimumab is recommended only for subjects with > 30kg body weight due to endotoxin exposure. Patients with a body weight less than or equal to 30 kg should be dosed using a weight -based dosing schedule.

Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled patients are presented in Section 4.3  
 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his enrollment code cannot be reused. 
Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  
 
4.3 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study Treatment and/or  Study

An individual subject will not receive any further investigational product if any of the following 
occur in the subject in question:  
1. Withdrawal of consent or lost to  follow -up. 
2. Adverse event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12440], contraindicates 
further dosing. 
3. Subject is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria for study 
participation at study entry and continuing investigational therapy might constitute a safety  risk.

treatment is normally expected to continue to participate in the study unless they specifically withdraw their consent to further participation in any study procedures and assessments  
Subjects who are permanently dis continued from further receipt of investigational product, 
regardless of the reason (withdrawal of consent, due to an AE, other), will be identified as having 
permanently discontinued treatment.  
 
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving inv estigational product will be 
followed for safety per Section 10.[ADDRESS_67367] to follow -up or 
enrolled in another clinical study. All s ubjects will be followed for survival. Subjects who 
decline to return to the site for evaluations will be offered follow -up by [CONTACT_62652] 2 as an alternative.  
 
4.4 Replacement of subjects  
 
A total of 20 biomarker -evaluable patients are planned to be enrolled on this trial. The number 
is small as a proof -of-concept study utilizing immune biomarkers as important secondary 
endpoints. To be evaluable for the secondary objectives, a patient needs  to receive 2 doses of

6.2 Dose and treatment  regimens  
 
6.2.1 Treatment  regimens  
 
Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy  
 
Patients in the combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab portion of the regimen will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w and 75 mg  tremelimumab  via IV infusion q4w for up to 
4 doses. Subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs) related to combination dose therapy (Part 1) that do not meet dose discontinuation criteria, may proceed to durvalumab monotherapy dosing (Part 2) without comple ting all 4 combination doses. A minimum of two combination cycles are 
required to proceed to durvalumab monotherapy. Additional durvalumab monotherapy doses will be given to complete  a total of 13 treatment  doses  (including combination  therapy).  Tremelimum ab 
will be administered first. Durvalumab infusion will start approximately [ADDRESS_67373] cycle, subsequent 
infusion observation periods can be conducted at the Investigator’s  discretion.  
 
Durvalumab monotherapy  
 
Starting on [ADDRESS_67374] approximately 1 hour. The observation period following  infusion  will be at (suggested [ADDRESS_67375] infusion).  
 
6.2.2 Criteria for  retreatment 
 
Retreatment is allowed (once only) for patients meeting the retreatment criteria below. The same treatment guidelines  followed  during the initial 12-month treatment period  will be followed  during 
the retreatment  period, including the same dose and frequency of treatments  and the same  schedule 
of assessments.  
 
Patients may undergo retreatment in 2 clinical scenarios, described below: 
 
1. Patients who achieve and maintain disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the  end 
of the 12-month treatment period may restart treatment with the combination upon evidence of 
PD, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, during follow -up. 
 
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67376] 2 dosing of cycles of the combination  of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab  portion of the regimen  (with  clinical  benefit  per Investigator judgment),  but 
subsequently have evidence of PD during the durvalumab monotherapy portion of the 
regimen, with or without confir mation according to RECIST 1.1, may restart treatment 
with the  combination.  
 
o Before restarting treatment, the Investigator should ensure that the patient: Does 
not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate continuing trea tment will not further benefit the  patient  
 
o Still fulfils the eligibility criteria for this study, including re -consenting to restart 
durvalumab and tremelimumab  
 
o Has not have received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy after their 
assigned treatment discontinuation.  
 
o Has had a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting treatment; all 
further scans should occur with the same frequency as during the initial 12 months of treatment until study treatment is stopped (maximum of 12 months of further treatment).  
 
During the retreatment period, patients receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab may resume 
durvalumab dosing at 1500 mg q4w with  75 mg of tremelimumab  q4w for up to 4 doses.  Subjects 
experiencing adverse events (AEs) related to c ombination dose therapy that do not meet dose 
discontinuation criteria, may proceed to durvalumab monotherapy dosing without completing all 
4 combination doses. Patients will then continue with durvalumab monotherapy (a minimum of 
two combination cycles ar e required to proceed to durvalumab monotherapy) at [ADDRESS_67377] dose of combination therapy (up to a total of 11 durvalumab monotherapy doses).  
 
Treatment through progression is at the Investigator’s discretion, and the  Investigator should 
ensure  that patients  do not have  any significant, unacceptable,  or irreversible  toxicities  that indicate 
that continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient. A patient with a confirmed 
progression receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab cannot continue therapy or obtain retreatment 
if dosing is ongoing in the combination portion of therapy (q4w  dosing)  and progression occurs  in 
a target lesion that has previously shown a confirmed  response. 
 
A patient  with confir med progression cannot  continue  therapy or obtain retreatment  with a regimen 
if dosing for the same regimen is ongoing and the progression occurs in target lesions that have previously shown a confirmed response of complete response or partial  response.  
 
Patients who the IND Office and/or the Investigator determine may not continue treatment will 
enter follow -up. 
 
Study drug preparation of durvalumab and tremelimumab 
 
Based on average body WT of 75 kg, 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) 
and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) is included in the current study.  
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67378] be prepared by [CONTACT_18413]’s designated IP 
manager using aseptic technique.  
 
If in-use storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. Infusion 
solutions must be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to commencement of 
administration . 
 
No incompatibilities between durvalumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have been observed. Dose of 1500mg durvalumab for patients >30 kg will be administered using an IV bag 
containing 0.9%  (w/v)  saline  or dextrose, with a final durvalumab  concentration  ranging from 1 to 
20 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2 - or 0.22- μm in -line filter. 
Remove 30.0 mL of IV solution from the IV bag prior to addition of durvalumab. Next,  
30.1 mL of durvalumab (ie, 1500 mg of durvalumab) is added to the IV bag such that final concentration is within 1 to 20 mg/mL (IV bag volumes 100 to 1000 mL). Mix the bag by [CONTACT_62654]. 
 
Patient  weight  at baseline should be used for dosing calculations  unless  there  is a ≥10%  change  in 
weight. Dosing day weight can be used for dosing calculations instead of baseline weight per institutional  standard.  
 
Calculate the dose volume of durvalumab and tremelimumab and number of vials needed for the 
subject to achieve the accurate dose.  
 
Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by [CONTACT_62655] a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of 
durvalumab, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes  (±5 minutes),  using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in-line filter.  Less than 55 minutes 
is considered a deviation. 
 
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV solution (0.9% [w/v] saline equal to the priming 
volume of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete 
the infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document 
if the line was not flushed . 
 
Standard infusion time is [ADDRESS_67379] be prepared by [CONTACT_737]’s designated 
IP manager using aseptic technique.  
 
It is recommended that the prepared final IV bag be stored in the dark at 2ºC -8°C (36°F -46°F) 
until needed. If storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. 
The refrigerated infusion solutions in the prepared final IV bag should be equilibrated at room 
temperature for about [ADDRESS_67380] 
been observed. Doses of 75 mg tremelimumab for patients >30 kg will be administered using an 
IV bag containing 0.9%  (w/v)  saline or dextrose,  with a final tremelimumab  concentration ranging 
from 0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2 μm  or 
0.22 μm in- line filter. Remove 3.8 mL of IV solution from the IV bag prior to addition of 
tremelimumab. Next, 3.8 mL of tremelimumab (ie, 75 mg of tremelimu mab) is added to the IV 
bag such that final concentration is within 0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL (IV bag volumes 50 to 500 mL). Mix the bag by [CONTACT_62656].  
Patient  weight  at baseline should be used for dosing calculations  unless  there  is a ≥10%  change  in 
weight. Dosing day weight can be used for dosing calculations instead of baseline weight per 
institutional  standard.  
 
Tremelimumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by [CONTACT_62657] n via an infusion pump into a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of 
tremelimumab, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes  (±5 minutes),  using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in-line filter.  Less than 55 minutes 
is considered a deviation. 
 
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of 0.9% (w/v) saline equal to the priming volume of 
the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the 
infusion a ccording to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document if 
the line was not flushed.

dosing  schedule  
 
 
6.2.4 Monitoring of dose  administration  
 
Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs (blood 
pressure and pulse) at the times specified in the Study Protocol.  
In the event of a ≤Grade 2 infusion -related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event and re -initiated at 50% of the initial 
rate until completion of the infusion. For patients with a ≤Grade 2 infusion -related reaction, 
subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial rate. Acetaminophen and/or an 
antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator. If the infusion -related reaction is ≥Grade [ADDRESS_67382] be available for verification by [CONTACT_456]'s 
study site monitor during on- site monitoring visits.  
 
Potentially hazardous materials such as used ampules, needles, syringes and vials containing hazardous liquids should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner and therefore will not be retained for drug accountability purposes.  
 
Study drug should be dispensed under  the supervision of the investigator  or a qualified  member  of 
the study- site personnel, or by a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. Study drug will be supplied only to 
subjects  participating  in the study. The site will account  for all investigational  study  drug dispensed 
and also for appropriate  destruction.  
 
6.3 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management 
 
6.3.1 Durvalumab and tremelimumab  
 
For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of durvalumab 
the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
 
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the  agent 
suspected of causing the toxicity where  required).  
• If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be given to 
continuing the same dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab along with appropriate 
continuing supportive care. If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted 
for durvalumab and tremelimumab (see Table  3). 
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of 
the approach taken.  
 
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab or tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued. 
 
Following the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab or tremelimumab can be modified based on toxicities observed. Dose reductions are 
not permitted . 
 
Based on the mechanism of action of  durvalumab or tremelimumab leading to T -cell activation 
and proliferation, there is the possibility of observing immune related Adverse Events (irAEs) 
during the conduct of this study. Potential irAEs include immune -mediated enterocolitis, 
dermatitis, hep atitis, and endocrinopathies. Subjects should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of irAEs. In the absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or 
symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy should be considered t o be 
immune -related.  
 
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67383] (AESIs) are detailed in 
Table 3. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 other version.

treatment. Concurrent medications related to co -morbidity (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc.) will 
be recorded in Prometheus. The name, dose, date star t and stop (as accurately as possible) along 
with indication of the medication will be collected. 
 
Supportive medications, pre -medications routinely prescribed prior to chemotherapy or 
immunotherapy infusion to mitigate reactions, hydration, or routine sur gical drugs will not be 
recorded in the Prometheus. 
 
Restricted, prohibited, and permitted concomitant medications are described below. See Table 3 
for guidance on management of IP -related toxicities.  
 
7.2.1 Permitted concomitant medications  
 
Investigators may p rescribe concomitant medications or treatments (e.g., acetaminophen, 
diphenhydramine) deemed necessary to provide adequate prophylactic or supportive care except

8.2.2 Informed consent for donated biological  samples 
 
Withdrawal:   
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated samples, the samples will be disposed 
of/destroyed, and the action  documented. As collection  of the biological  samples is an integral  part 
of the study, then the subject is withdrawn from further study  participation.  
 
Waiver  
The additional correlative research involves reviewing medical records of patients who were treated at 
the MD Anderson Cancer Center on this trial.  The samples which will be used were previous ly collected 
on other laboratory trials with signed informed consent.  The trials with available samples are:  LAB02 -
152, PA13-0291, PA13-0247, PA11-0852, PA12-1099, PA15-0956.  Now that patients have completed 
treatment phase it would be difficult to obta in additional informed consent. We are requesting a waiver 
of informed consent and waiver of Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information for 
the retrospective portion of this study. A Waiver of Informed Consent and a Waiver of Authorizat ion is 
requested because the data review and sample analysis involve no additional diagnostic or therapeutic 
intervention, as well as no direct patient contact.  It would be impractical to obtain additional consent 
from patients because they are no longer in treatment, have died or may be lost to follow -up.   
 
The Principal Investigator:  
 
• Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study site,  are 
immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented  
 
• Ensures the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 52 of 103  
consent immediately and that samples are disposed/destroyed, the action documented and 
the signed document returned to the study site 
• Ensures that the subject is informed about the sam ple disposal.  
 
8.3 Other assessments 
 
8.3.1 ECOG performance  status  
 
ECOG performance status will be assessed at the times specified in the assessment schedules 
() based on the following:  
0 = Fully active; able to carry on all pre -disease performance without restrictions  
1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, for example, light housework or office work 
2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self -care, but unable to carry out any wor k activities. Up and 
about more than 50% of waking hours. 
3 = Capable of only limited self -care; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours 
4 = Completely disabled; cannot carry on any self -care. Totally confined to bed or chair  
5 = Dead  
 
9.[ADDRESS_67398] 48 weeks and then every 12 weeks 
until confirmed PD. 
Additional imaging may be performed at any time to confirm suspected progression of disease. 
Study films (abdominopelvic CT/MRI and bone scan) should be read on site. The principal investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a sub- investigator will evaluate the images for all subjects for the duration of the 
study.  
 
The same imaging method used for an individual subjects at baseline should be used throughout 
the entire study for that subject, unless for medical reasons the method must be changed (e.g. 
inability to receive contrast agent).  
 
If a subject is unable to return for restaging scans due to symptoms of progressive disease, he may  
have scans done by a local facility. These scans should be sent to the investigator for review. 
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67399] version 1.1:  
 
• To be considered measurable, soft tissue tumor deposits (other than lymph nodes) must 
be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a minimum size of 10mm by [CONTACT_62663] (scan slice thickness no greater than  5mm).  
• To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable a lymph node must be ≥15mm 
in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_28842] (scan slice thickness no greater than 
5mm).  
• All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15mm shor t axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions will 
be considered non-measurable.  
 
9.1.2 Calculation of tumor  burden  
 
• At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters (Σp- diam) of all index lesions (up to 5 lesions per organ, up to 
10 lesions in total that are representative of all involved organs) is calculated and 
recorded. Non- measurable tumor lesions will be  recorded.  
• At each subsequent tumor assessment, the Σp- diam of the index lesions and of new, 
measur able lesions (up to 5 new lesions per organ, up to 10 lesions in total that are 
representative of all involved organs) are added together to provide the total tumor burden:  
o Tumor burden= Σp- diam index lesions + Σp- diam new, measurable  lesions  
• Non-measurabl e tumor lesions should also be recorded at baseline and at each  subsequent 
tumor  assessment.  
• At the end of study for that subject, maximum percent reduction from baseline in tumor 
burden will be  graphed  
 
9.1.3 Definition of radiographic PD for soft tissue tumor  deposits 
 
• An increase in tumor burden of ≥ 20% relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor 
burden, including the baseline Σp- diam if that is the smallest on study). In addition to  the 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 54 of 103  
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an a bsolute increase of at least 5 
mm. 
• In patients classified as having PD within [ADDRESS_67400] tremelimumab dose, 
confirmation of PD by a second scan ≥ 4 weeks later in the absence of rapid clinical 
deterioration will be required, as long as the patient does not show other signs or 
symptoms of disease progression as judged by [CONTACT_11168].  
• The appearance of one or more new lesions (measurable or non -measurable) will not be 
considered evidence of PD as long as all of the following criteria are  met: 
o The increase in tumor burden remains <20% relative to  nadir.  
o There are no signs nor symptoms of disease progression (including 
laboratory parameters, e.g. worsening liver function tests attributable  to 
liver metastases) as judged by [CONTACT_093].  
o There is no further increase in tumor burden observed in a  repeat, 
consecutive assessment obtained ≥ 4 weeks later.  
o For non- measurable tumor lesions an increase in overall disease burden 
comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to  declare 
PD for measurable disease (i.e. ≥20%) will be considered evidence of  PD. 
o If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the 
date of the initial scan.

9.2.1 Definition of radiographic PD for bone tumor  deposits  
 
• Radiographic disease progression for bone lesions is defined as the appearance ≥2 new 
areas compared to the baseline bone scan that can unequivocally be attributed to prostate 
cancer (i.e. not attributable to healing or flare of pre -existing  lesions).  
• Confirmation of PD by a second scan ≥4 weeks later in the absence of rapid clinical 
deteri oration will be required, as long as the patient does not show other signs or 
symptoms of disease progression as judged by [CONTACT_11168].  
• Equivocal progression on bone scan must be confirmed by [CONTACT_15210]  (e.g. 
CT or MRI) and/or confirmato ry bone scan ≥4 weeks  later.  
• If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of  the 
initial scan.

9.4 Definition of progression of disease  
 
For the purposes of this study, progression of disease (PD) is a composite endpoint, consisting of 
clinical deterioration and/or radiographic progression as defined below. Subjects with PSA 
progression alone will not be considered to have PD.  
 
9.4.1 Clinical deterioration  
 
Clinical deterioration is defined as any symptomatic clinical event attributable to disease 
progression that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], indicates that the subject is not benefiting from study treatment. Examples include:  
 
• Need for palliative radiation  involving more than one  site 
• Surgery or kyphoplasty to any neoplastic bone  lesion  
• Cancer associated persistent decrease in performance status (eg, lasting for more than  14 
days) of at least 2 points from baseline  
• New bladder outlet or ureteral obstruction  attributable cancer  progression  
• Any change of anti -neoplastic therapy for prostate  cancer  
 
9.4.2 Radiographic  progression 
 
Radiographic progression in soft tissue tumor deposits and/or bone as defined in (Sections 9.1.3 
and 9.2.1) above will be considered evidence of disease progression.  
 
PSA progression alone will not be used to define progression.

10.1 Safety Parameters  
 
10.1.1  Durvalumab + tremelimumab adverse events of special  interest  
 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and may require close moni toring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_62664]. An AESI may be serious or non- serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of  this investigational product. 
 
AESIs for durvalumab and tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring 
and/or interventions such as steroids, imm unosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. 
These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy. An immune -related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an adverse event  that 
is associated  with drug exposure  and is consistent  with an immune -mediated  mechanism  of action 
and where there is no clear alternate aetiology . Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) 
data, as appropriate, should be used to support an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be 
made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the  irAE.  
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 57 of 103  
 
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an irAE, the 
Investigator should promptly contact [CONTACT_38234].  
 
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab include:  
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• ALT/AST increases / hepatitis /  hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (i.e. events of encephalitis, peripheral motor  and 
sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia  gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy (i.e. events of hypophysitis, adrenal insuffic iency, and hyper - and 
hypothyroidism)  
• Dermatitis  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis -  increased serum lipase , increased  serum 
amylase)  
Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the current version 
of the durvalumab and tremelimumab Investigator Brochure. For durvalumab and tremelimumab, 
AESIs will comprise the  following:  
 
Pneumonitis  
AEs of pneumonitis are also of interest for [COMPANY_008], as pneumonitis has been observed with 
use of anti -PD-1 mAbs (but not with anti -PD-L1 mAbs). Initial work -up should include a high-  
resolution CT scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry. Pulmonary consultation is highly recommended. Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -related AEs (irAEs) 
including pneumonitis are provided in Table 3.  
 
Infusion reactions  
AEs of infusion reactions (also termed infusion -related reactions) are of special interest to 
[COMPANY_008] and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring from the start of IP infusion up to [ADDRESS_67403] been reported with anti -PD- 
L1 and anti -PD-1 therapy (Brahmer et al 2012). As with the administration of any foreign protein 
and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be caused by [CONTACT_62665],  including acute  anaphylactic  (IgE-mediated)  and anaphylactoid reactions against  the 
mAbs and serum sickness. Acute allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result  in 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 58 of 103  
 
death. Acute allergic reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, 
fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness. Guidelines for the 
management of patients with hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) and infusion-  
related reactions are provided in Table 3.  
 
Hepatic function abnormalities (hep atotoxicity) 
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent  increase in total bilirubin to be greater  than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent  findings  are those 
that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow -up investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_62666]/ or whether there is objectiveevidence that 
clearly supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with  distended 
gallbladder) or an agent other than the IP. Guidelines for management of patients with hepatic function abnormal ity are provided in Table  3. 
 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE when tremelimumab is used as monotherapy.  In rare cases,  colon perforation  may occur  that requires  surgery (colectomy) 
or can lead to a fatal outcome  if not properly  managed. Guidelines  on management  of diarrhea  and 
colitis in patients receiving tremelimumab are provided in Table  3. 
 
Endocrine disorders  
Immune -mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper - and 
hypothyroidism. Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated endocrine 
events are provided in Table 3.  
 
Pancreatic disorders  
 
Immune -mediated pan creatitis includes autoimmune pancreatitis, and lipase and amylase 
elevation. Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated pancreatic disorders 
are provided in Table  3. 
 
Neurotoxicity 
Immune -mediated nervous system events include encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory 
neuropathies, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis. Guidelines for the management of patients 
with immune -mediated neurotoxic events are provided in Table 3.  
 
Nephritis  
 
Consult with Nephrologist. Monitor for sig ns and symptoms that may be related to changes in  renal 
function (e.g. routine urinalysis, elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased creatinine clearance, 
electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, proteinuria, etc.) Patients should be thoroughly  
evaluated  to rule out any alternative  etiology  (e.g., disease  progression, infections  etc.). Steroids  
should be considered  in the absence of clear  alternative  etiology even  for low grade  events (Grade 2), 
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67404] of this study. 
Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], BMS -936558 (anti -PD- 
1 mAb), and BMS -936559 (anti -PD-L1 mAb) and may include i mmune -mediated enterocolitis, 
dermatitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicity), pneumonitis, and endocrinopathies (Hodi et al 2010, 
Brahmer et al 2012, Topalian et al 2012). These AEs are inflammatory in nature and can affect any  
organ. With  anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA -4 combination therapy, the occurrence of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_62612]. Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of irAEs. In the absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an 
immune -related etiology should be considered for signs or s ymptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy. In addition to the dose modification guidelines 
provided in Table  3, it is recommended  that irAEs  are managed  according  to the general  treatment 
guidelines outlined for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134] (Weber et al 2012). These guidelines recommend the following:  
 
• Patients should be evaluated to identify any alternative  etiology. 
 
• In the absence of a clear  alternative  etiology, all events  of an inflammatory  nature 
should be considered immune  related.  
 
• Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_62613] -grade  events.  
 
• Systemic corticosteroids  should be considered  for a persistent  low-grade  event  or 
for a severe event.  
 
• More potent immunosuppressive should be considered for events not  responding 
to systemic steroids (eg, infliximab or mycophenolate).  
 
• If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, 
the Investigator should immediately contact [CONTACT_38234].

Dose  Modifications  Toxicity Management  
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be madeto 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_67406] dose of study drug/study 
regimen  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related  AE 
following resumption of  dosing  
Grade  1 No dose  modification  
Grade  2 Hold  study drug/study regimen dose until Grade  2 resolution to 
Grade  ≤1. 
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.  
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper.  
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:  
1. The event stabilizes and is  controlled.  
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical  judgement.  
3. Doses of prednisone are at ≤10 mg/day or equival ent. 
Grade  3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen 
may be permanently discontinued.  Please refer  to guidelines  below.  
Grade  4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen.  
Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels, hold study drug/study 
regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, study 
drug/study regimen may be continued or resumed.  
Note: For Grade 3 and above asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels hold study 
drug/regimen and if complet e work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, may 
continue or resume study drug/regimen  It is recommended that management of irAEs follows the guidelines presented in this 
table:  
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant medications, and  infections).  
− In the absence of a clear  alternative  etiology,  all events  should be considered 
potentially immune  related.  
− Symptomatic  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_62614]-grade  (Grade 
1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events.  
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) 
events,  promptly  start prednisone  1 to 2 mg/kg/day  PO or IV equivalent.  
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of 
taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [eg, up to 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization  or improvement  of 
symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28 days of taper).  
− More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg, infliximab) (also refer to the individual sections of the irAE for specific type of 
immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic  steroids.  
− Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated  for Grade 
3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor  response  
(eg, inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). 
Continuation of study drug/study regimen in this situation should be based 
upon a benefit/risk analysis for that patient.

(asymptomatic,  clinical 
or diagnostic 
observations only; 
intervention not 
indicated)  
Grade 2 
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; 
limitin g instrumental 
ADL)  No dose modifications required. 
However, consider holding study 
drug/study regimen dose as clinically 
appropriate and during diagnostic  work- 
up for other etiologies.  
 
Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grad e ≤1.  
• If toxicity worsens, then treat  as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.  
• If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate  study 
drug/study regimen will be based 
upon treating physician’s clinical 
judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper.   
For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only): 
− Monitor and closely  follow  up in 2 to 4 days for  clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
laboratory work- up and then as clinically indicated.  
− Consider pulmonary and infectious disease  consult.  
 
 
For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms): 
− Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
− Promptly start systemic steroids (eg, prednisone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV  equivalent).  
− Reimage as clinically  indicated.  
− If no improvement within 3  to 5 days, additional  workup 
should be considered and prompt treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day started  
− If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_62615] 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF  inhibitors  
(eg, infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label for general guidance before using infliximab.  
− Once the patient is improving, gradually taper steroids  over 
≥28 days and consider prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals,  
  or anti-PCP treatment  (refer  to current  NCCN  guidelines  for

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes  
(such as Guillain -Barre 
and myasthenia gravis) Any Grade  General  Guidance  For Any  Grade:  
− The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients 
may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that 
can result  in substantial morbidity or in the worst  case,  death. 
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27567], and signs of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_62619].  
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the 
diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding 
effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the  neuraxis. 
Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is 
essential to have a low thres hold to obtain a neurological 
consult.  
− Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg, electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_62620] a neurology consultation.

10.3 Study recording period and follow -up for adverse events and serious 
adverse  events  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded from t ime of signature [CONTACT_62686], throughout  the treatment period and including the follow -up period  ([ADDRESS_67410] 
dose of durvalumab +  tremelimumab).  
 
During the course of  the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each 
subject. Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events 
continue after discontinuation/study completion.  
 
If a subject discontinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and therefore continues to have tumor assessments (per Table 2), drug or procedure -related SAEs must be 
captured until the patient is considered to have confirmed PD and w ill have no further tumor 
assessments.  
 
The investigator is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject returns to baseline status,  or until the condition  has stabilized  with the expectation  that it will remain  chronic, 
even if t his extends beyond study participation.  
 
Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_62671], but without  further  recording  in Prometheus. After 
[ADDRESS_67411] -related SAEs will continue to be 
followed for  safety.  
 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune retains the right to request additional information for any subject with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
 
Post study events  
 
After the subject has been permanently withdrawn from the study, there is no obligation for the  
investigator to actively report information on new AE or SAEs occurring in former studysubjects after the 90 -day safety follow -up period for patients treated with durvalumab + tremelimumab. 
However, if an investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after the subject has been  permanently  withdrawn  from study, and he/she  considers  there  is a reasonable possibility that 
the event is related to study treatment, the investigator should notify the study sponsor and [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Drug  Safety.

10.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse  vents  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting for MD Anderson -sponsored IND Protocols  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused  death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life  functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
 
Important  medical  events that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening, or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or  at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR  312.32). 
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse 
events.  Any important  medical  event  can and should be reported  as an SAE  if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND  Office.  
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review  Board  Policy  for Investigators  on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse  Events  for 
Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or 
unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 
working days of knowledge of the  event).  
• All life-threatening  or fatal  events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND  Office.  
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 82 of 103  
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for 
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC  IRB.  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_67412] returned to baseline, progression of the event has 
stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_67413]  be reported  to the IND Office.  This may include 
the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
10.4.1  Reporting to FDA  
 
• Serious adverse even ts will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_62672] (Safety 
Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR  312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_62625], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_67414], or to the study procedure(s) . The reporting period for SAEs is [ADDRESS_67415] dose 
of durvalumab + tremelimumab or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy. The investigator  and/or Sponsor are responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or the 
Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  
 
The investigator and/or sponsor must inform the FDA, via the M.D. Anderson SAE form, of any 
serious  or unexpected  adve rse events that occur  in accordance with the reporting  obligations  of [ADDRESS_67416]  be faxed  to [COMPANY_008] at  the time the event  is reported to the FDA.  It 
is the responsibility of the sponsor to compi[INVESTIGATOR_62492] a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines and to ensure that these 
reports are also submitted to [COMPANY_008] at the s ame time.  
 
* A cover page should accompany the M.D. Anderson SAE form indicating the  following: 
 
• “Notification from an Investigator Sponsored  Study”  
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 83 of 103  
• The investigator IND number assigned by [CONTACT_62673] 
• The investigator’s name [CONTACT_62687]  
• The trial name/title and [COMPANY_008] ISS reference number (ESR -15-[ZIP_CODE])  
 
* Sponsor  must  also indicate,  either  in the SAE  report  or the cover  page, the causality  of events  in 
relation to all study medications and if the SAE is related to disease progression , as determined 
by [CONTACT_62674].  
 
* Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by [CONTACT_62675]’s designated 
mailbox:  AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astraz eneca.com  
• 
• If a non- serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must 
also be provided to [COMPANY_008] and the FDA.  
• Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA still need to  be 
reported to AstraZen eca using the MD Anderson form for serious adverse events. This 
information should be reported on a monthly basis and under no circumstance less 
frequently than quarterly. 
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_67417] dose of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab safety follow -up period must be reported as follows:  
 
• Death  that is clearly  the result  of disease  progression should be documented but and 
be reported as an  SAE.  
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under study, 
the AE causing  the death  must  be reported  to as a SAE  within  24 hours  . The report 
should contain a comment regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, 
if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of  death.  
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a  SAE.  
Deaths that occur following the protocol -defined 90- day post -last-dose of Durvalumab safety 
follow -up period  will be documented as events  for survival  analysis,  but will not be reported as an 
SAE.  
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67418] receiving a dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab in excess of 
that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
 
Any overdose of a study subject with durvalumab + tremelimumab, with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety e- mailbox. If the 
overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded as an AE (see Section 10.3). Overdose  
does not automatically  make  an AE serious,  but if the consequences  of the overdose  are serious,  
for example  death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  the event  is serious  and must  be recorded  and reported as an 
SAE (see Section 10.3). There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose of 
durvalumab or  tremelimumab.  
 
The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
 
10.5.2  Hepatic function abnormality/Hy’s Law  
 
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and 
occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3×ULN toget her with total bilirubin ≥2×ULN may need to be 
reported as SAEs. Hepatic function abnormality (as defined in Section 10.1.3.) in a study subject, with or without associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function 
abnormal” within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety using the designated Safety e- mailbox (for contact 
[CONTACT_3031]), unless a definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has been confirmed.  
 
• If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is 
unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study subj ect 
will be based on the clinical judgment of the  investigator.  
 
• If no definitive  underlying diagnosis  for the abnormality is established,  dosing of the study 
subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow -up investigations and inquiries must be 
initiated by [CONTACT_62676].  
 
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_62677]/MedImmune.  
Protocol 2016- [ADDRESS_67419] dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or [ADDRESS_67420] dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the longer time  period. 
 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_67421] dose 
should, if possible, be followed up and documented. The patient fathering the child will be asked 
to provide information.  
 
10.5.4  Disease  progression  
 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which  the IP is being studied. It may be an increase  in the severity  of the disease under 
study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as diseaseprogression 
and not an AE. Events  that are unequivocally due to disea se progression  should not be reported as 
an AE during the  study  
 
10.5.[ADDRESS_67422]  been 
identified after the patient’s inclusion in this study.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_67423] one follow -up for clinical  outcome  measures.  Patients  
who do not meet this level of evaluability will be described separately to establish  any 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 86 of 103  
trends in patient evaluability and comparability of compliant patients with the intended patient 
population based on available information.  
 
11.2 Methods of statistical  analyses  
 
11.2.1  Primary safety analyses  
 
For the interim safety monitoring described below, an extreme toxicity (TOX) will be defined as 
any grade [ADDRESS_67424] 8 weeks of therapy (2 cycles) with one 
exception. Any grade [ADDRESS_67425] grade and the ultimate attribution within the patient. Exploration of these measures by [CONTACT_5265] m ay also be presented.  
 
11.2.2  Efficacy  analyses  
 
Efficacy of this combination will be measured by [CONTACT_62678]- free survival (PFS), 
radiographic PFS, and maximal decline of PSA from baseline. PSA PFS, radiographic PFS, and 
time to maximal PSA decline will start at the first day of treatment and will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier. The numeric PSA value at maximal decline will be summarized by a boxplot and 
as a scatter plot of maximal decline by [CONTACT_62679].  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_67426] one dose of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab, even if the patient is not evaluable for the efficacy or biomarker endpoints. Based 
on the method of Thall et al. (1995) continual monitoring after the 6th patient is planned. 
Calculations were performed in Multc Lean 2.1.  
 
Denote the probability of TOX by Θ E. We assume Θ E ~ beta (0.8, 1.2). Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_62626]: Pr( Θ E > 0.40 | data) >0.90. That is, we will stop  
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 87 of 103  
if, at any time during the study, we determine  that there  is more  than a 90% chance that the extreme 
toxicity rate is more than 40%, a constant rate that is the maximum acceptable for TOX. The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_62627]. Continual monitoring will be carried out monthly after the 6th patient is treated 
according t o the following  table:  
 
Table 4. Toxicity monitoring rules (after the 6 patient is treated)  
 
If there are this many patients with TOX:  5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 
Stop if there are this many or fewer 
patients treated with ≥1 dose of study drug:

MDACC Investigational New Drug (IND) office will review Efficacy/Toxicity data with 
Principal Investigator (and statistician if needed) at a predetermined interval as indicated next: The first analysis will occur after the first [ADDRESS_67428] while being able to accrue within 6 
months. No formal hypotheses are planned. These patients will form the basis of designing a 
hypothesis -driven study in the future. However, we can make a statement about what might be 
detected  in secondary  endpoints  at this sample size. The association  between  CD3  change  and PSA 
PFS will be explored with a Cox model with CD3 as a continuous measure. Assuming  that

Page 89 of 103  
75% (80%) of patients will progress by [CONTACT_2054], [ADDRESS_67429] 80% power to 
detect a regression coefficient of 0.72 (0.70) at a 2- sided 5% significance level, assuming the 
change  in CD3  has a standard deviation of 1. The regression  coefficient  of 0.72 (0.70)  is equivalent 
to a hazard  ratio of 2.1 (2.0)  or a doubling of risk per unit increase in CD3  (Calculations  performed 
in NCSS -PASS 2005). This would hold true for both biomarker and any model of PSA P FS or 
Radiological/Clinical PFS.  
 
Even if fewer than [ADDRESS_67430] ing such information in future trials will be valuable.

APPENDIX  1. ACTIONS REQUIRED IN CASES OF INCREASES IN 
LIVER BIOCHEMISTRY AND EVALUATION OF HY’S  LAW  
Introduction  
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately report 
cases of Hy’s Law. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of 
elevated liver biochemistries. Specific guida nce on the managing liver abnormalities can be 
found in Section   and  of the  protocol. 
 
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a pati ent meets potential 
Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. 
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) crit eria 
are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_62684] (IMP).  
 
The Investigator is responsible for record ing data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting 
Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review 
and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.  
 
Definitions  
 
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) 
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 × Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥2 × ULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study medication, irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP).  
 
Hy’s Law (HL)  
AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. 
 
For PHL and HL, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.  
 
Identification of Potential Hy’s  Law Cases  
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 101 of 103  
In order to identify cases of PHL, it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation 
or in combination:  
 
• ALT ≥3 ×  ULN  
• TBL ≥2 ×  ULN 
The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report, and if the identification 
criteria are met will:  
 
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section Definitions of  this 
Appendix for definition) by [CONTACT_62685]  
 
• Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory  eCRF  
Follow -up 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met 
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
 
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the  guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. 
 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
 
• Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team.  
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss, and agree on an 
approach for the study patient’s follow -up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this 
contact [CONTACT_48887]:  
• Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  
 
• Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed 
with the Study  Physician.  
 
• Complete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available.  
• If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets  serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard report ing procedures. 
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 102 of 103  
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases 
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
 
• No later than [ADDRESS_67450] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:  
 
• If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate  eCRF.  
 
• If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the  eCRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes.  
 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:  
 
• Report an SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes.  
 
− The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria  apply. 
 
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment  of 
“related” should be assigned. 
 
If there is an unavoidable delay of over 3 weeks in obtaining the information necessary to assess 
whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
 
• Report an SAE (report term “Potential Hy’s Law”), applying serious criteria  and 
causality assessment as per  above.  
• Continue follow -up and review accord ing to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review.

Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and 
After Starting Study Treatment 
This section is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatment, having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.  
 
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met the Investigator will:  
 
• Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’  condition# compared 
with the last visit where PHL criteria were  met# 
− If there is no s ignificant change no action is  required.  
− If there is a significant change notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will 
inform the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described is 
Section Potential Hy’s L aw Criteria metof this  Appendix.  
#A “significant” change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of 
the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
 
Actions Required for  Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33099]’s Law  
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already 
met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
 
The requirement to conduct follow -up, review, and assessment of  a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL 
is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:  
 
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to 
be the disease under study, eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe  infection, 
or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study treatment and 
at his or her first on -study treatment visit as described in Section Actions Required When 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study  Treatment?  
If No: follow the process described in Section Potential Hy’s Law Criteria metof this Appendix. 
If Yes:  
Determine if there has been a significant  change in the patient’s condition# compared with when 
PHL criteria were previously met  
• If there is no significant change, no action is  required.  
Protocol 2016- 0769 
July 28, 2020 
Page 104 of 103  
• If there is a significant change, follow the process described in Section Potential  Hy’s  
Law Criteria met of this  Appendix. 
#A “significant” change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of 
the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total b ilirubin) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may 
be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.

and safety data . 
Added exploratory objective, endpoint , and efficacy assessment 
to evaluate tumor response in subjects with RCC using independent imaging review (IIR).  IIR assessment of tumor response for RCC subjects has 
been added to obtain unbiased

administered either as monotherapy, or in combination 
with other checkpoint inhibitors or 
other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
For the previously treated RCC 
subjects , it was specified that PD -
1 treatment progression is defined 
by [CONTACT_692963]: 
a) Has received at least 2 doses of 
an approved anti -PD-1/PD -L1 
mAb  
b) Has demonstra ted disease 
progression after PD -1/PD -L1 as 
defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1.  The initial evidence of disease progression (PD) is to be 
confirmed by a second assessment 
no less than [ADDRESS_1253907] documented PD, in the 
absence of rapid clinical 
progression.  To ensure there is a consistent 
application of the desired pre-study disease progression 
after prior anti -PD-1/PD -L1 
definition in this previously treated RCC subset and to 
decrease the risk of including 
subjects with 
pseudo- progression.  Clinical Protocol Synopsis,

 • To investigate the relationship between candidate efficacy biomarkers and anti -tumor activity 
of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab:  
a. To evaluate the relationship between programmed cell death protein 1 ligand ( PD-L1) 
expression levels and other relevant biomarkers (eg,  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, T -cell 
repertoire, ribonucleic acid [RNA] signature [CONTACT_385502]) in tumor samples and anti-tumor 
activity of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab.  
b. To evaluate differences in tumor tissue characteristics in biopsies taken post treatment with 
lenvatinib  in combination with pembrolizumab versus baseline.  
Study Design 
Overall Design:  
This is a multicenter, open -label study with a Phase 1b and a Phase 2 component.  
Phase 1b - MTD :  This phase will determine and confirm the MTD  of lenvatinib in combination 
with pembrolizumab.  Subjects in Phase 1b will have one of the following tumors: non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma, EC , urothelial carcinoma (UC), squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck , or melanoma.   Ten to 30 subjects will be enrolled in Phase 1b.  
The dose of 1 of the 2 study drugs, pembrolizumab, will not change during the MTD phase, while 
the second study drug, lenvatinib, will start at 24 mg and then be reduced, if necessary, to either 20 mg or 14 mg.  
Phase 2 - Expansion:  Subjects will be assigned by [CONTACT_894841]  1 of 6 cohorts to receive the 
MTD , which was established as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)  in the P hase 1b portion of 
this study , (lenvatinib 20 mg/day orally  + pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks [Q3W] IV ) to 
assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in the selected tumor-typ es.  Each cohort will 
consist of subjects with 1 of the tumor types listed in the Phase 1b section above.  
For subjects in Phase 1b and Phase 2, toxicity will be managed by [CONTACT_3532], dose reduction and/or treatment discontinuation in accordanc e with prespecified  dose modification 
instructions.  Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject choice, withdrawal of consent, completion of 35 treatments (approximately 2 
years) with pembrolizumab , lost to follow up or discontinuation of this study by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor .  
Patients can receive up to 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab.   Subjects 
who discontinue  pembrolizumab for any reason  and are still receiving lenvatinib study drug will be 
transitioned to commercial lenvatinib if local country regulations permit .  Subjects who discontinue 
pembrolizumab after 35 treatments may continue treatment with lenvatinib alone unless any other criteria above apply.  
Phase 1b - MTD:   Dosing will begin  at the full dose of both drugs due to the well -established 
safety profiles of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, the non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_51140], and 
the desire to treat patients at doses shown to be effective in previous studies. Lower dose levels of  
lenvatinib will be explored as necessary depending on observed toxicity.  Phase 1b will begin with 
Dose Level 1 ; lenvatinib 24 mg/day orally and pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks IV will be 
administered to subjects with selected solid tumors on a 21-day t reatment cycle.  Two dose de-
escalation steps are included: Dose Level 2 (lenvatinib 20 mg/day orally + pembrolizumab 200 mg 
Q3W, IV) and Dose Level 3 (lenvatinib 14 mg/day orally + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W, IV).  
For determination of MTD, only dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of treatment will be assessed.  The determination of the DLT will be made jointly by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor and 
investigators after safety data from each d ose level have been reviewed.  
If 0 of 3 subjects in a given dose level cohort experiences a DLT , then 7 more subjects will be 
enrolled into that dose level  to confirm the MTD.  If 1 of 3 subjects has a DLT, then 3 more

Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 23 of 155  
 subjects will be enrolled into that dose level  for a total of 6 subjects.   If only 1 of these 6  subjec ts 
has a DLT, then 4 more subjects will be enrolled into that dose level  to confirm the MTD.  
If 2 or more subjects at a dose level experience a DLT, then, following consultation with the PIs 
the study will proceed with enrollment in the next defined lower  dose ( Dose Level  2 or 3), with 
dose reduction of lenvatinib to 20 or 14 mg once a day , respectively, in combination with 200 mg 
pembrolizumab Q3W.  
For confirming the MTD, DLTs and intolerable toxicities (that cannot be managed with dose 
interruption and/or reduction) during the first cycle of treatment for the [ADDRESS_1253938] 3 weeks (Cycle 1) of treatment.  If the MTD is not confirmed at a dose level, 
then enrollment will proceed to the next lower dose level .  The  sponsor and investigators will 
review all subjects’ safety and clinical data to jointly determine the RP2D of the combination of lenvatinib with pe mbrolizumab.  
If [ADDRESS_1253939] a DLT in Dose Level 3, enrollment in the study will stop.   
A DLT is defined as any of the following:  
• Any of the hematological or nonhematological toxicities noted in the table below considered to 
be at least possibly related to lenvatinib and/or pembrolizumab occurring during Cycle 1.  
• Failure to administer ≥ 75% of the planned dosage of lenvatinib as a result of treatment -related 
toxicity during Cycle 1 . 
• Subjects who discontinue treatment due to treatment -related toxicity. 
• Greater than 2 week delay in starting Cycle 2 because of a treatment -related toxicity, even if 
the toxicity does not meet DLT criteria.

Only toxicities with a clear alternative explanation (eg, due to disease progression) or transient 
(≤72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms 
based on investigator determination can be deemed a non-DLT.  
All subjects enrolled in Phase 1b will be assessed for DLTs during the DLT assessment window of Cycle 1 (Treatment Phase).  Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to completing the Treatment Phase for any reason other than DLT will be replaced.   Once they complete the 
Treatment Phase, each subject still receiving study treatment will transition into the Extension Phase.  Tumor assessments will continue during the Extension Phase .  As of Amendment 09, t umor 
assessments will continue during the Extension Phase as per local standard of care but not less frequent than every 6 months.
  Tumor assess ments will not be collected during the Follow -Up 
period of the Extension Phase .  
 
Phase 2 - Expansion: 
After the MTD is confirmed , and depending on the safety and efficacy observed , 6 cohorts will be 
enrolled.  Each of these cohorts will enroll subjects with only 1 type of tumor (ie, NSCLC ,

Study Phases  
The study will be conducted in 3 phases:   a Pretreatment Phase, a Treatment Phase, and an 
Extension Phase.  
The Pretreatment Phase will last no longer than 28 days and includes:  
A Screening Period , to obtain informed consent and establish protocol eligibility, and a  Baseline 
Period , to confirm protocol eligibility prior to treatment.  
The Treatment Phase will begin with the administration of the first dose of study drug to the first 
subject in Cycle 1 and will continue in 21-day (3 -week) cycles.  The Treatment Phase consists of 1 
treatment period as described below.  
Treatment Period  
Phase 1b :  The Treatment Period for each subject ends after completing  Cycle 1 of treatment or 
they discontinue early.  Those subjects who discontinue study treatment in Cycle 1 transition to the 
Off Treatment (Off -Tx) V isit of the Follow -up Period of the Extension Phase.  Those who 
complete Cycle 1 transition to the Treatment Period of the Extension Phase.   
Phase 2 :  The Treatment Period for each subject ends after completing  [ADDRESS_1253946] discontinue s early.  Those who discontinue study  treatment before completing 8 cycles 
transition to the Off -Tx Visit of the Follow -up Period of the Extension Phase.  Those that complete 
8 cycles transition to the Treatment Period of the Extension Phase.   
Extension Phase  
The Extension Phase consists of a treatment period and a follow -up period.  
Treatment Period  (Extension Phase):  Subjects still receiving study treatment at the end of the 
Treatment Phase will continue to receive the same treatment .  Those subjects that discontinue study 
treatment transit ion to the Off -Tx Visit of the Follow -up Period of the Extension Phase.   Note that 
all AEs must be captured for [ADDRESS_1253947] dose of study treatment .  
Follow -up Period (Extension Phase):  
As of Amendment 9, the Follow -Up Period will consist of the Of f-Tx Visit.  No further visits will 
be conducted.  The sponsor has decided to terminate survival follow -up for all subjects currently in 
survival  follow -up.  Survival follow -up data will no longer be collected after the Off -Tx Visit and 
after [ADDRESS_1253948] of care.  Subjects will be followed 
every 12 weeks (±1  week) for survival and subsequent anticancer treatments.   The sponsor may

General g uidelines for holding periods of lenvatinib due to procedures : 
For minor procedures , lenvatinib should be stopped 2 days before the procedure and restarted 
2 days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.  Needle biopsies 
(fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_894824]) are usually considered minor pr ocedures.  
For major procedures , lenvatinib should be stopped at least 1 week ( 5 half-lives) before the 
procedure and then restarted once there is clear wound healing and no risk of bleeding, but at least 
[ADDRESS_1253972] igator to determine if it is a major or minor 
procedure.  Usually a major procedure implies general anesthesia.  
 
Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab dose interruption for subjects who experience pembrolizumab-related toxicity will 
be in accordance with the table b elow.  
Adverse events (AEs) (both nonserious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These AEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must  be withheld for drug-related toxicities

an imaging core laboratory (ICL)for archiv ing and potential independent analysis.  As of 
Amendment 3, tumor assessment scans for the EC  subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_3530] .  As of 
Amendment  5, tumor assessment scans for the renal cell carcinoma subjects will also be assessed 
by [CONTACT_3530].  As of Amendment 08, for subjects enrolled in the RCC cohort who were previously treated 
with anti-PD -1/PD -L1 m Ab, available pre-Baseline scans that demonstrate previous progression, 
will be collected by [CONTACT_894847], and potential future independent review.  
As of Amendment 0 8,  scans acquired after data cutoff for final efficacy analysis, in any cohort, 
will no longer be sent to the imaging core lab.   As of Amendment 09, pre -baseline scans for RCC 
subjects are not required.  
Tumor assessments will be carried out during the Pretreatment Phase and then every 6 weeks 
(during the sixth week; counting from C1D1) until Week 24, then  every [ADDRESS_1253976] of care but not less 
frequent than every 6 months.   Tumor assessments will not  be collected during the Follow -Up 
period of the Extension Phase .  Magnetic resonance imaging /MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis and of other known sites of disease will be obtained at Screening (within 28 days prior to Cycle 1  Day 1), at all tumor assessment time points, and as indicated clinically   and as per local 
standard of care.  Color photographs containing a millimeter  scale must be taken of all skin lesions 
being used as target lesions.  Historical standard of care scans that are performed with scanning 
parameters consistent with the requirements for this protocol within [ADDRESS_1253977] for head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis; 
however, the chest must be assessed using CT.  Chest disease may not be followed using chest x -
ray.   
A brain scan (CT with contrast or MRI pre- and post -gadolinium) must be performed at Screening 
to assess potential  central nervous system  (CNS ) disease and/or metastases.  For subjects with 
previously treated eligible brain metastases, a brain scan must be performed at all tumor assessment 
time points.  For all subjects, a follow -up brain scan must be performed to confirm immune -related 
complete response (irCR) within 1 week of response confirmation, or if clinically indicated.   
The tumor  assessment schedule should not be affected by [CONTACT_427694]. 
Subjects going Off -Tx without disease progression will also undergo tumor assessments per the 
Schedule of Procedures/Assessments until disease progression is documented or another anticancer therapy is initiated.   
The same method of assessment must be used at all -time  points as was used at Screening. 
Throughout the study it is critical that the same imaging methodology be  applied and contrast be 
consistently provided unless IV  contrast becomes medically contraindicated during the course of 
treatment or the dose of contrast needs to be adjusted based on the subject’s health status.

 Bone scans will be performed at Screening, every 24 weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated, an d at 
confirmation of irCR (except for subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ).  
Lesions identified on bone scans must be verified and followed with correlative cross-sectional 
imaging.    
In order for immune -related stable disease (irSD)  to be considered the best overall response, it must 
occur ≥[ADDRESS_1253978] radiological assessment of tumor response status will be performed at Week 6 (±1 week), unless there is clinical indication warranting ear lier radiologic imaging.  If imaging at Week 6 
shows irSD, treatment will be continued and tumor assessments will be conducted at the next regularly scheduled imaging time  point, ie , at Week 12 (±1 week).  Responses (irPR [ PR] or irCR) 
should be confirmed no less than [ADDRESS_1253979] 4 weeks later, but generally at the next scheduled tumor assessment time point in order to confirm immune -related progression disease (irPD ).  If repeat imaging shows a reduction 
in the tumor burden compared to the initial tumor assessment demonstrating PD, treatment may be 
continued as per treatment schedule.  If repeat imaging confirms irPD , subjects will be 
discontinued from study treatment.  In determining the tumor time  point response, investigators 
should consider all target lesions as well as nontarget  lesions and new lesions.   The decision to 
continue study treatment after the first evidence of PD is at the investigator’s discretion based on 
the clinical status of the subject . 
Subjects may continue receiving study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are 
clinically stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]: 
• Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) indicating 
disease progression  
• No decline in ECOG PS  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease  
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg , cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention  
If irPD is confirmed and the subject is experiencing extraordinary clinical benefit, the site must 
contact [CONTACT_894848].  
Tumor assessments per modified RECIST 1.1 will follow Eisenhauer , et al.  (2009) ; however, up to 
10 target lesions, up to 5 per organ, may be selected (as opposed to a maximum of 5 target lesions, up to 2 per organ).  
Pharmacokinetic:  
Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib will be measured.   
Dose-normalized PK profile for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab from this study 
will be compared graphically to that from patients with different tumor types from completed 
studies of those  receiving lenvatinib monotherapy . 
Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacogenomic:  
Blood and Tissue Biomarkers:  Blood samples for the development of exploratory predictive 
biomarkers will be collected prior to the first dose of study drug, on Cycle 1 Day 15, and on D1  of 
all subsequent cycles during Treatment Phase, and at the Off-Tx  assessment.  Subjects will be 
required to provide an archival tumor tissue sample and/or a fresh biopsy of tumor before t reatment 
for biomarker analyses (p atients with inaccessible tumors for biopsy specimens can be enrolled 
without a biopsy upon consultatio n and agreement by [CONTACT_456]).   For s ubjects in the NSCLC

 cohort every effort is to be made to obtain a fresh  biopsy of tumor at the beginning of Cycle 2 
(optional for other cohorts on study) if they have recovered adequately from the biopsy taken prior 
to starting therapy and to provide the acquired tissue for these biomarker analyses.  Biomarker discovery and/or validation will be performed to identify blood or tumor biomarkers that may be 
useful to predict subject response to lenvatinib and/or pembrolizumab, as determined by [CONTACT_894849] -related and/or safety -related outcomes as well as for potential use in diagnostic 
development.  Blood samples from subjects receiving lenvatinib  and pembrolizumab may be 
analyzed using global p roteomic methods, enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
multiplex bead -based immunoassay, or other assays/methods or new technology.  In addition, 
biomarkers identified in other lenvatinib  clinical studies may also be assessed in the biomarker 
samples  collected from subjects enrolled in this study.  The decision to perform exploratory 
biomarker analysis may be based on the clinical outcome of th is study and/or the signals observed 
in other clinical studies  or other information available at that time.  
Archived, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)  tissue or a newly obtained biopsy will be 
collected from all subjects for potential assessment of mutations and other genetic alterations 
and/or proteins including PD -1/PD -L1 status and other relevant biomar kers (eg , tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes, T-cell repertoire, ribonucleic acid [RNA] signature [CONTACT_385502]) which may be important 
in the development and progression of cancer as well as for potential use in diagnostic development.  Appropriate technology/methodologies will be used based on the amount of tumor tissue available.  
For all tumor types except NSCLS, optional fresh paired tumor biopsies will be collected  from 
consented subjects to examine markers including markers of target engagement, relevant pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and potential markers of response.  Fresh biopsies should be limited 
to readily accessible tumor lesions (eg, skin , peripheral lymph nodes , liver metastases that can be 
readily accessed using CT guidance).  Subjects should have t he biopsy before administration of the 
first dose of study drug and at a time point [ADDRESS_1253980] dose (if they have recovered 
adequately from the biopsy taken prior to starting therapy) .  For NSCLC , every effort is to be made 
to obtain a fresh  tumor biops y; subjects will have fresh tumor biopsies collected  from consented 
subjects before administration of the first dose of study drug and at a time point [ADDRESS_1253981] dose (if they have recovered adequately from the biopsy taken prior  to starting therapy).  
A blood sample for peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and plasma isolation will be collected from 
enrolled subjects.  Cell free nucleic acid isolated from plasma samples may be used to obtain 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and explore tumor genetic alterations such as mutations observed 
in archival tumor samples as well as those which develop during drug treatment.    
In Phase 2, as of Amendment 4, a blood sample for nucleic acid analysis will be collected for 
potential asse ssment of gene expression profiling .  In Phase 2, as of Amendment 3, a blood sample 
will be collected for potential pharmacodynamic s and pharmacogenomic s analysis.  Variation in 
lenvatinib exposure or the occurrence of AE s observed in the study population may be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_3541] –nucleotide polymorphisms with PK, safety, or pharmacodynamic data.   Genomic 
DNA extracted from blood samples may be used to confirm whether the DNA sequence variants 
observed in DNA extracted from tumor material are limited to the tumor, for potential microsatellite instability analysis, and for potential immune response monitoring.  
As of Amendment 0 6, available known mutation status including mismatch repair (MMR) or 
microsatellite instability (MSI) status will be collected  on the case report form . 
Data obtained will be used for research to assist in developi[INVESTIGATOR_894826].  The DNA will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not

standard deviation (SD), median, and range (minim um and maximum) unless otherwise specified. 
Laboratory  test results will be  summarized using [ADDRESS_1253989] line treatment versus other subjects with prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  For the renal cell carcinoma cohort, safety subgroup analyses may  be presented for 
treatment naïve subjects, subjects who were previously treated with an anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapy , 
and subjects who were previously treated without an anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapy . 
Sample Size Rationale  
Phase 1b: A sample size of 10 to 30 subjects will be enrolled to assess MTD.  This is not based on statistical power considerations.  
Phase 2:  A sample size of [ADDRESS_1253990] sufficient follow -up to be evaluated for response.  The decision to expand enrollment will be 
based on the results of 2  interim analyses , which will spend β= 0.012 and β= 0.[ADDRESS_1253991] and 
second interim an alyse s, respectively.  Based on an assumption of H
0:  16% ORR and H 1:  34% 
ORR, at 2-sided α = 0.02, this design will give 97% statistical power with [ADDRESS_1253992] 
interim analysis (N = 21), if there are more than 3 responses, then  approximately 40 additional 
subjects will be enrolled.  At the second interim analysis (N = 60), if there are more than 12 
responses, approximately 60 additional subjects will be enrolled.  If there are 12 or fewer 
responses, the sponsor may decide whether  to expand enrollmen t based on clinical outcome, eg ,

7 INTRODUCTION  
Study E7080-A001-111, which will be conducted in patients, has 2 goals.  One is to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of the combination of a programmed cell 
death protein 1 ( PD-1) inhibitor (pembrolizumab) with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
lenvatinib.  The second is to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in selected tumors.  
7.1 Indication  
7.1.1 PD-1 Inhibitors and Pembrolizumab 
Antitumor immunity is often ineffective due to the tight regulation associated with the maintenance of immune homeostasis ( Stagg , 2013).  Recent studies have shown that cancer 
cells, as well as stromal cells and immune cells in the cancer microenvironment can upregulate expression of the B7 family of inhibitory molecules.  These are peripheral membran e proteins found on activated antigen presenting cells ( Coico, et al., 2003).  
Compelling evidence indicates that B7 proteins can suppress T ‑cell responses ( Chen, 2004; 
Sharpe and Freeman , 2002) aiding tumor immune evasion.  These negative signals are 
largely provided by [CONTACT_894856] B7- family.  One of these is PD -1, also known as 
B7‑H1.  PD- 1 limits T cell effector functions within tissues by [CONTACT_894857]8 T cell responses.  By [CONTACT_894858]-1, tumor cells bloc k 
antitumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.  Indeed, expression of the PD-1 
ligand ( PD-L1) has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in melanoma and 
hepatocellular carcinoma ( Topalian, et al., 2012; Gadiot, et al., 2011; Gao , et al., 2009 ). 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001 -111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 52 of 155  
 Clinically, blockade of PD-1 or PD-L1, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) , has 
demonstrated substantial clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, RCC, non-
small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC), bladder, head and neck cancers, and other tumors ( Philips 
and Atkins, 2015; Robert, et al., 2014; Hamid and Carvajal, 2013; Brahmer , et al., 2012).  
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD- 1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and programmed 
cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1.  Pembrolizumab has an acceptable 
preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure. 
Pembrolizumab has demonstrated initial clinical efficacy in single arm monotherapy trials in 
subjects with NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma (UC) , 
gastric cancer, triple negative breast cancer and Hodgkin’s Lymphoma as determi ned by 
[CONTACT_30530].  Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted in these tumor types as well as a number of other advanced solid tumor indications and hematologic malignancies.  For study details please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
7.1.2 Lenvatinib  
Lenvatinib is an oral, multi–TKI active against ret proto -oncogene, vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor
 (VEGFR)1–3, FGFR1 –3, a stem cell factor receptor ( KIT), and 
platelet -derived growth factor receptor α ( Yamamoto, et al., 2014; Tohyama, et al., 2014; 
Okamoto, et al., 2013; Matsui , et al. , 2008a; Matsui, et al., 2008b).  It is approved in the US 
for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine- refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, and in combination with everolimus for 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma following 1 prior antiangiogenic therapy.  In the 
EU, lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally 
advanced or metastatic, differentiated ( papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, 
refractory to radioactive iodine , and in combination with everolimus for the treatment of 
adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma following 1 prior vascular endothelial 
growth factor- targeted therapy .  As outlined below, data from Phase 2 clinical studies 
showed lenvatinib has antitumor activity in multiple other tumors.  
In patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, treated with lenvatinib 24 mg once daily + best supportive care, lenvatinib was found to be active with longer survival in these subjects who had had 2 or more lines of prior treatment.  O verall survival 
(OS)  was the primary objective of this study.   
In a study (E7080-G000- 204) to evaluate the antitumor activity  of lenvatinib 24 mg orally 
once daily in female subjects with surgically unresectable endometrial carcinoma (EC)  who 
have disease progression following 1 prior platinum-based, systemic chemotherapy regimen, the ORR ( complete response [CR] + partial respon se [PR]) was 14.3% based on the 
assessments by [CONTACT_551274] (IRR), the primary endpoint of the study.  The 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001 -111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 53 of 155  
 ORR based on investigator assessments was 21.1% , indicating that lenvatinib is active as a 
second -line treatment in subjects with ad vanced EC. 
A study was conducted to determine the activity of lenvatinib in previously treated subjects 
with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma (E7080-G000-206).  The primary endpoint of the study was ORR, based on IRR assessment for the intent -to-treat (ITT) population.  The 
ORR was 8.6% in subjects with melanoma not harboring the V600E BRAF mutation and 9.0% in subjects with melanoma harboring the activating BRAF mutations (mainly the V600E mutation).  All were PRs . 
7.[ADDRESS_1254014] of combining lenvatinib with PD-1/L1 mAbs has been investigated in the CT26 colorectal cancer syngeneic model PD -L1 mAb) as well as the LL/2 lung cancer syngeneic 
model (PD-1 mAb) (Data on F ile).  Combination treatment with lenvatinib and PD -1/L1 
mAb showed significant and superior antitumor effects compared with either compound alone.  Tumor-a ssociated macrophage (TAM) cells express PD -L1 at a higher level than 
cancer cells in the CT26 syngeneic model , and lenvatinib significantly decreased the TAM 
population (Data on F ile).  Because TAM cells produced interleukin 10 (IL -10) and 
transforming growth factor, beta 1 ( TGF β) (Noy and Pollard, 2014), lenvatinib might 
increase antitumor immunity in the CT26 model and up- regulate the effect of the PD -1 signal 
inhibitors.  
For the assessment of MTD, the lenvatinib doses selected are 24 mg, 20 mg, and 14 mg once 
a day ( QD) all in conjunction with 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks ( Q3W ).  24 mg is 
the recommended  dose for locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine -
refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (LENVIMA Package Insert /SmPC ).  [ADDRESS_1254015] and second doses in lenvatinib’s dose reduction scheme for all tumors 
(except hepatocellular carcinoma) for which data are available.   
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W.  Based on the totality of 
data generated in the Keytruda
® development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose 
of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type.  As outlined 
below, this dose is justified by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose - and exposure- efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W )  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit-risk including OS at 200 mg 
Q3W across multiple indications  
• Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from pharmacokinetic [ PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically- based PK 
analysis) at 200 mg Q3W  
Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with melanoma and NSCLC , covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously 
treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all- comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and 
in combination with chemotherapy).  Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001 -111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 54 of 155  
 Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies 
compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006).  All of these studies demonstrated flat dose- and exposure- response relationships 
across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5-fold difference in exposure.  
The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied.  Subsequently, flat dose -exposure-response relationships were also observed in other 
tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming [ADDRESS_1254016] tumor PD- 1 saturation over a 
wide range of tumor penetration and PD-1 expression.  This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD-1 saturation in both blood and tumor. 
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of 
body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight- based dosi ng, with considerable overlap 
in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose.  Supported by [CONTACT_131877], and given that fixed-dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.  
No dose reduction is allowed for pembrolizumab in this study.

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
Overall Design: 
E7080-A001-111 is a multicenter, open- label  study in subjects with selected solid tumors .  
All subjects in the study will receive lenvatinib and pembrolizumab while participating in the 
study.  The study has 2 phases, Phase 1b and Phase 2.  In Phase 1b, 10 to 30 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in 1 to 3 dose levels to determin e the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) .  In Phase [ADDRESS_1254017] interim analysis (N = 21), if there are more than 3 responses, then approximately 40 additional subjects will be enrolled.  At the second interim  analysis (N = 60), if there are more than 12 
responses, approximately 60 additional subjects will be enrolled.  If there are 12 or fewer responses, the sponsor may decide whether to expand enrollment based on clinical outcome, eg, ORR and DOR.   
The renal  cell carcinoma cohort may be further expanded to approximately 145 total renal 
cell carcinoma ( RCC) subjects to allow for approximately [ADDRESS_1254018] 
received 1 or 2 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_160062] d an anti -programmed cell death protein 1
 (PD)-
1/PD -L1 mAb.  The decision to expand enrollment will be based on the results of [ADDRESS_1254019] when 22 subjects (11 treatment naïve and 
11 previously treated without an anti- PD-1/PD -L1 mAb) have sufficient follow-up to be 
evaluated for response.  At the first interim analysis (N = 22), if there are more than [ADDRESS_1254020] progressed on treatment with an anti- PD-1/PD -L1 mAb , 
administered either as monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
, and as of Amendment 07, the regimen with an anti- PD-1/PD -L1 mAb must 
be the most recent therapy .  PD -1 treatment progression is defined by [CONTACT_845367]:  
a) Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti- PD-1/PD -L1 mAb  
b) Has demonstrated disease progression after PD -1/PD -L1 as defined by [CONTACT_44852] (RECIST ) v1.1. The initial evidence of disease 
progression (PD) is to be confirmed by a sec ond assessment no less than  [ADDRESS_1254021] documented PD 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001 -111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 57 of 155  
 c) Progressive disease (PD) has been documented within [ADDRESS_1254022] dose of 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 mAb (refractory disease) or ≥[ADDRESS_1254023] dose of 
anti-PD-1/PD- L1 mAb (late re lapses)  
The second interim analysis will include these [ADDRESS_1254024] sufficient follow -up to be evaluated for response.  At  the second interim 
analysis, whether the 
previously treated renal cell carcinoma subset  will be further expanded will 
be decided  based on cl inical review of both efficacy and safety data.  
For subjects in Phase 1b and Phase 2, toxicity will be managed by [CONTACT_3532], dose reduction, and/or treatment discontinuation in accordance with the dose modification instructions outlined in  Table [ADDRESS_1254025] choice, withdrawal of consent, completion of 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab, lost to follow up or discontinuation of this study by [CONTACT_456].  Patients can receive up to 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab.  
Subjects who discontinue pembr olizumab after 35 
treatments may continue treatment with lenvatinib alone unless any other criteria above apply.   
Subjects who discontinued  pembrolizumab for any reason  and are still receiving lenvatinib study 
drug, will be transitioned to commercial lenva tinib if local country regulations permit.  
Phase 1b - MTD : 
Dosing will begin at the full dose of both drugs due to the well- established safety profiles of 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, the nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_51140], and the desire to treat patien ts at doses shown to be effective in previous studies.   Lower dose levels of 
lenvatinib will be explored as necessary depending on observed toxicity. 
Phase 1b will determine and confirm the MTD of lenvatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  Subjects in Phase 1b will have one of the following tumors: non- small cell 
lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, EC , UC, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck 
(HNSCC) , or melanoma .  The dose of 1 of the 2 study drugs, pembrolizumab, will not 
change during the MTD phase, while the second study drug, lenvatinib, will start at 24 mg and then be reduced, if necessary, to either 20 mg or 14 mg.  Phase 1b is illustrated in Figure 
1. 
Phase 1b will begin at  Dose Level  1: lenvatinib 24mg/day orally and pembrolizumab 200 mg 
every 3 weeks, IV will be administered to subjects with selected solid tumors on a 21 -day 
treatment cycle.  Two dose de- escalation steps are included: Dose Level  2 (lenvatinib 
20 mg/day orally + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W, IV) and Dose Level  3 (lenvatinib 
14 mg/day orally + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W, IV).  For determination of MTD, only 
dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), as defined in Table [ADDRESS_1254026] been reviewed.  
If 0 of 3 subjects in a given dose level cohort experiences a DLT, then 7 more subjects will be enrolled into that dose level  to confirm the MTD.  If 1 of 3 subjects has a DLT, then 3

Phase 2 – Expansion: 
Subjects will be assigned by [CONTACT_894861] 1 of 6 cohorts ( minimum of 10 or 20 evaluable 
subjects per cohort) to receive the MTD , which was established as the RP2D  in the Phase 1b

9.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The study design follows well- established designs for Phase 1b/2 oncology studies, including 
ongoing studies featuring co-administration of oncology drugs with different mechanisms of action and PD -1 inhibitors.  The design allows for rapid identification of tumors types which 
will respond to the combination of a TKI with a PD-1 inhibitor.  The tumor types to be studied in this study ( NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, EC , UC, HNSCC, or melanoma ) have 
shown response to lenvatinib and/or a PD-[ADDRESS_1254048] meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

at least 1 week and they reached the normal body mass index ( BMI ) (if the weight loss occurred but  it is still 
above normal BMI, they can restart the study treatment at a lower dos e once the weight has been stable for at 
least 1 week). Normal BMI should be used as the new baseline for furt her dose reductions.

f. Refer to Table 3  for adjusted dose.  
g. For asymptomatic Grade ≥3 elevations of amylas e and lipase, the sponsor’s medical monitor should be consulted 
to obtain permission to continue treatment.  
 
General guidelines for holding periods of lenvatinib due to procedures: 
For minor procedures, lenvatinib should be stopped 2 days before the procedure and restarted 
2 days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.  Needle biopsies (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_894824]) are usually considered minor 
procedures. 
For major procedures, lenvatinib should be stopped at least 1 week (5 half- lives) before the 
procedure and then restarted once there is clear wound healing and no risk of bleeding, but at 
least 2 week s after the procedure.  It is up to the investigator to determine if it is a major or 
minor procedure.  Usually a major procedure implies general anesthesia.

Eisai  
Final: [ADDRESS_1254073] 1 week before C1 D1.  Early detection and effective 
management of hypertension are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and reductions.   
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP ≥90 mm  Hg) is confirmed on [ADDRESS_1254074]’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice.  For previously normotensive subjects, appropriate antihypertensive  therapy should be started when systolic BP ≥ 140 mm  Hg or 
diastolic BP ≥[ADDRESS_1254075], is preferred  (Kilfoy , et al., 2009).  
Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a subject is at imminent risk to develop a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complications of uncontrolled hypertension (eg, BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg, significant risk factors for ca rdiac disease, 
intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant co-morbidities).  Once the subject has been on the same hypertensive medications for at least 48 hours and the BP is controlled, lenvatinib should be resumed as described below. 
During the Treat ment Period, both in the Treatment Phase and in the Extension Phase, 
subjects with systolic BP ≥ 160 mm  Hg or diastolic BP ≥ [ADDRESS_1254076] their BP 
monitored on Day 15 or more frequently as clinical indicated until systolic BP has been 
≤150 mm Hg and diastolic BP has been ≤ 95 mm Hg for 3 consecutive months.  If a repeat 
event of systolic BP ≥ 160 mm  Hg or diastolic BP ≥[ADDRESS_1254077] 
resume the Day 15 evaluation until systolic BP has been ≤ 150 mm  Hg and diastolic BP has 
been ≤ 95 mm Hg  for 3 consecutive months. 
The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mm Hg confirmed on repeat measurements after 1 hour: 
1. Continue lenvatinib and institute antihypertensive therapy for subjects not already receiving antihypertensive medication 
2. For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or 1 or more agents of a different class of antihypertensive should be added. 
3. If systolic BP ≥ 160 mm  Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mm  Hg persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_3059], then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted.  It should be restarted at one lower dose level as specified in Table 3  only when systolic BP

The following guidelines should be followed for the management of Grade 4 hypertension 
(life-threatening consequences): 
• Institute appropriate medical management  
• Discontinue study drug  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 M ANAGEMENT OF PROTEINURIA  
Regular assessment of proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table  8).  Guidelines for assessment and management of 
proteinuria: 
1. Grading will be based on the 24-hour urinary protein result.  Management of lenvatinib administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria according to instructions contained in Table 2,“Dose Modifications for Lenvatinib Treatment- Related Toxicity,”  
2. A 24 -hour urine collection (within 72 hours) to verify the grade of proteinuria for protein 
quantitation is required in the following situations: 
− The first (initial) occurrence of ≥2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick while on study drug  
− A subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria occurring on the same lenvatinib dose level 
− When there has been a lenvatinib dose red uction and at the new dose level the urine 
protein dipstick result is 2+, 3+, or 4+ 
3. Urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ should be performed on Day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months. 
Grading of proteinuria should be performed according to CTCAE v4.03 ( Appendix 3) but 
will be based on the 24- hour urine c ollection for total protein result, if a 24 -hour urine was 
performed at that time point.

 For subjects with lenvatinib -related toxicity, the dose reduction and/or interruption 
instructions provided in Table 2 of the study protocol should be followed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 M ANAGEMENT OF HEPATOTOXICITY  
Regular monitoring of liver function tests (eg, alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate 
transaminase [AST], bilirubin levels) should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments and as clinically indicated.  If signs occur indicating a decrease in liver function by 1 grade or more from baseline, the instructions contained in Table 2 of the protocol should be followed, “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions”.  Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If hepatic failure occurs the study drug must be discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1254082] pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, DVT signs including lower- extremity 
swelling, redness and warmth to touch or tenderness.  In case any of these signs or symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such signs and symptoms promptly to the treating physician.  If a thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructions contained in Table 2 
of the protocol should be followed, “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions.” Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring. If a subject experiences life -threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, 
including pulmonary embolism, the study drug must be discontinued.   
[IP_ADDRESS].6 MANAGEMENT OF POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME 
(PRES)  
In clinical studies with lenvatinib, events of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) were reported in less than 1% of lenvatinib -treated subjects.  Posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome is a neurological disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances.  Mild to severe hypertension may be present.  An MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.  Appropriate measures should be taken to control blood pressure.  In subjects with signs or symptoms of PRES, dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuation may be required per instructions included in Table 2.  Please refer to Section 7 of the Investigator's Brochure for further information on lenvatinib, including the full set of special warnings and precautions for use (Section 7.4.4). 
[IP_ADDRESS].7 MANAGEMENT OF HYPOCALCEMIA  
Serum calcium should be monitored every 3 weeks per the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments.  Hypocalcemia should be treated per institutional guidelines (eg, using, as appropriate, calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin D supplem entation) until resolution.

 [IP_ADDRESS].8 MANAGEMENT OF QT PROLONGATION  
Lenvatinib should be withheld in the event of development of QT interval prolongation ≥ 500 
msec.  Lenvatinib should be resumed at a reduced dose when QTc prolongation is resolved to 
<480 msec or ba seline.  Monitor potassium, calcium and magnesium, and replenish as 
appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS].9  MANAGEMENT OF OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW 
Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with lenvatinib and  periodically during 
lenvatinib treatment.  Advise participants regarding good oral hygiene practices.  Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on lenvatinib treatment, particularly in participants at higher risk.  For participants requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ).  Withhold lenvatinib if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of 
adequate resolution. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  (200 mg)  will b e administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion, Q3W (infusions 
lasting between 25 minutes to 40 minutes are acceptable).  The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion and administration of infusion solution. 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. 
Study treatment with pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the 
scheduled D1  of each cycle due to admi nistrative reasons.  
Adverse events (both nonserious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These AEs  may occur shortly after the first dose or 
several months after the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must be withheld  for 
drug- related toxicities and severe  or life -threatening AEs as per  Table 4 below.  See

and/or holidays).  Subjects should be placed back on study treatment within [ADDRESS_1254085]'s study record. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 S UPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES FOR PEMBROLIZUMAB  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional antiinflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses o f steroid tapering 
may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.  The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to 
pembrolizumab, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance.  Refer to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for guidelines regarding dose modification and supportive care.  
It may be necessary to perform additional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.

For the assessment of MTD, the lenvatinib doses selected are 24 mg, 20 mg, and 14 mg QD all in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab Q3W  given IV .  While 24 mg is the 
recommend dose for locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine -
refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (LENVIMA Package Insert /SmPC ),  [ADDRESS_1254086] and second doses in lenvatinib’s dose reduction scheme for all tumors (except hepatocellular carcinoma) for which data are available.  While 2 mg/kg is the recommended dose for pembrolizumab for melanoma ( KEYTRUDA Package Insert /SmPC ), 
a 200 mg Q3W fixed dose regimen is planne d to be used in this study (see Section 7.2 ).  
9.4.[ADDRESS_1254087]  
Lenvatinib will be administered with water orally once  a day (with or without food) in 
21-day cycles at approximately the same time each day.  Treatment cycles will be counted 
continuously regardless of dose interruptions.  On D1 of each cycle, it will be administered approximately within 1 hour after completion of pembrolizumab administration.

 Pembrolizumab will be administered as a dose of 200 mg as a 30-minute IV infusion, Q3W 
(infusion durations of 25 minutes to 40 minutes are acceptable).  The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion and its  
administration.  Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  Study treatment of pembrolizumab may be administered up to [ADDRESS_1254088] be documented by [CONTACT_894868]. 
• Any single agent therapy, and any combination of cytotoxic, hormonal, biological 
targeted agents, and/or humanized antibodies, scheduled to be administered as a preplanned treatment, given concomitantly, sequentially or both, is considered 1 regimen. 
• Planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy (to debulk the tumor prior to surgical intervention) plus postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 regimen. 
• For chemotherapy:  if, due to toxicity, the dosing of one or more of the components must be reduced, or one or more of the components of the regimen must be omitted, or one of the components must be replaced with another similar drug, the changed version of the original regimen is not considered a new regimen.  However, if a new component, dissimilar to any of the original compon ents, is added to the regimen, the new 
combination is considered a new regimen.    
• For prior VEGF/VEGF R-targeted agents, treatment with each agent will be counted 
individually, regardless of the duration of administration.  
• If the treatment is interrupted f or surgery or radiotherapy or any other reason and then 
continues with an unchanged schedule and components, that treatment is considered as 1 
regimen despi[INVESTIGATOR_3085].  
 
All prior medications (including over-the-counter medications) administered [ADDRESS_1254089] during the course of the study (starting at the date of informed consent) until [ADDRESS_1254090]’s health and that is not ex pected to interfere with the evaluation of 
or interact with lenvatinib or pembrolizumab may be continued during the study. 
Treatment of complications or AEs, or therapy to ameliorate symptoms (including blood 
products, blood transfusions, fluid transfusions, antibiotics, and antidiarrheal drugs), may be given at the discretion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of (or to interact with) lenvatinib or pembrolizumab.

 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroidal antiinflamma tory drugs, and low- molecular -weight heparin ( LMWH) 
are permissible but should be used with caution.  Granulocyte colony- stimulating factor  or 
equivalent may be used in accordance with American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO), 
institutional, or national guidelines.  Erythropoietin may be used according to ASCO, 
institutional, or national guidelines, but the subject should be carefully monitored for increases in red blood cell counts. 
The investigator will record on the Adverse Event CRF any AE for which the concomitant 
medication/therapy was administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug –Drug Interactions  
Lenvatinib’s weak in vitro inhibitory and induction potential on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Study No. XT063020) suggests a low risk of lenvatinib interference with the PK of other drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097] P450 enzymes which are co -administered in usual clinic 
practice.  Nonclinical studies identify CYP3A4 as an important enzyme responsible for 
human hepatic metabolism of lenvatinib.  However, c linical studies conducted to test these 
findings showed that co-administration of lenvatinib with CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors or inducers is not of clinical concern (see Appendix 5 for a summary of clinical findings).   
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
pembrolizumab.  Pembrolizumab is a mAb ; pharmacokinetic interactions with le nvatinib 
(and vice- versa) are not expected.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing study .  If there is a clinical indication for any m edication or vaccination 
specifically prohibited during the study , discontinuation from study therapy or vaccination 
may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical Director.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subject on study therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and the subject.

Significant findings at the Screening Visit will be recorded on the Medical History and Current Medical Conditions CRF.  Changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Assessments  
All efficacy endpoints, other than OS, will be based on the tumor assessments performed by [CONTACT_894871] 1.1.   Treatment decisions 
by [CONTACT_894872].   All scans for tumor assessments 
performed during the study should be archived in accordance with the standard local practice.  The scans from Phase 1b must be accessible in the event of a sponsor request to submit them for central review.   For Phase 2, ima ges acquired for tumor assessments will 
be sent to an imaging core laboratory (ICL)for archiv ing and potential independent 
analysis.   As of Amendment 3, tumor assessment scans for the EC subjects will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_3530].  As of Amendment 5, tumor assessment scans for the renal cell carcinoma subjects 
will also be assessed by [CONTACT_3530] . 
 As of Amendment 08, scans acquired after data cutoff for 
final efficacy analysis, in any cohort, will no longer be sent to the ICL . 
Renal Cell Carcinoma PD-1 pre-treated cohort 
As of Amendment 08, for subjects enrolled in the RCC cohort who were previously treated 
with anti- PD-1/PD -L1 mAb, available pre -Baseline scans will be collected by [CONTACT_894873], and potential future independent review. 
Pre-Baseline scans in this context are  as follows: 
• nadir scan on prior anti -PD-1/PD -L1 mAb therapy (additional scans on prior 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 mAb therapy may be submitted if the nadir scan is unavailable ); 
• initial progression on prior approved anti- PD-1/PD -L1 mAb therapy; 
• confirmed progression on prior anti -PD-1/PD -L1 mAb therapy ( preferably no less than [ADDRESS_1254096] documented PD, as of Amendment 7) .  
As of Amendment 09, pre- baseline scans for  RCC subjects are not required. 
Tumor assessments will be carried out during the Pretreatment Phase and then every 6 weeks 
(during the 6th week; counting from C1D1) until Week 24, then every [ADDRESS_1254097]/MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and of other known sites of disease will be obtained at Screening (within 28 days prior to C1 D1), at all tumor assessment time points, and as indicated clinically and as per local standard

Final: [ADDRESS_1254098] head and neck scans performed.  
The computed tomography ( CT) scan should be a diagnostic quality spi[INVESTIGATOR_894830], and the MRI scan should be performed with IV 
gadolinium chelate.  Scans of the neck, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of the body may be 
done with MRI instead of CT, but evaluation of the chest must be done with CT.  If iodinated IV contrast is contraindicated, the chest evaluation  should be done with non- contrast CT, and 
the abdomen and pelvis evaluation should be performed using either CT with oral contrast (without IV contrast) or MRI with gadolinium chelate IV contrast (the latter is preferred). Spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]/multidetector CT should be  performed with a 5-mm contiguous slice reconstruction 
algorithm.  If body MRI scans are performed, contiguous slices of [ADDRESS_1254099] 
(Positron emission tomography [ PET]- CT) combination scanner are not acceptable.   
Ultrasound should not be used for radiographic tumor assessment.  Chest disease may not be followed using chest x -ray.   
A brain scan (CT with contrast or MRI pre - and post-gadolinium) must be performed at 
screening to assess potential CNS disease and/or metastases.  For subjects with previously 
treated eligible brain metastases, a brain scan must be performed at all tumor assessment time points.  For all subjects, a follow-up brain scan must be performed to confirm immune -
related complete response ( irCR ) within 1 week of response confirmation, or if clinically 
indicated.   
The tumor assessment schedule should not be affected  by [CONTACT_427694]. 
Subjects going Off -Tx without disease progression will also undergo tumor assessments per 
the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments until disease progression is documented or another 
anticancer therapy is initiated.   
The same method of assessment used at s creening must be used at all time points. 
Throughout the study it is critical that the same imaging methodology be applied and contrast 
be consistently provided unless IV contrast becomes medically contraindicated during the course of treatment or the dose of contrast needs to be adjusted based on the subject’s health status.   
Bone scans will be performed  for all sub jects (except for subjects with HNSCC) at screening, 
every 24 weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated, and at confirmation of irCR . A bone scan 
(
99m-technetium polyphosphonate scintigraphy, whole body bone MRI, or 18F-NaF-PET) to 
assess bone metastases wi ll be performed within 6 weeks prior to C1D1 (historical scans are 
acceptable) and then every 24 weeks (within that 24th week) from C1D1 for all tumor types except for HNSCC, or sooner if clinically indicated.  For those visits where the bone scan

Final: [ADDRESS_1254100]/MRI scans (ie , Weeks 48 
and 72), the bone scan should be added to the closest CT/MRI time point (eg , Weeks 51 and 
69).  In subjects whose body CT/MRI scans indicate that irCR has been achieved, except for 
subjects with HNSCC, a bone scan will be required at confirmation of irCR to exclude new bone metastases.  The same methodology and acquisition techniques used at screening should be used throughout the study to ensure comparability. Lesions detected on bone scans must be followed with cross-sectional imaging.     
In order for immune -related stable disease (irSD) to be considered the best overall response, 
it must occur ≥ [ADDRESS_1254101] radiological assessment of tumor response status will be performed at Week 6 
(±1 week), unless there is clinical indication warranting earlier radiologic imaging.  If 
imaging at Week 6 shows irSD, treatment will be continued and tumor assessments will be conducted at the next regularly scheduled imaging time point, ie,  at Week 12 (±1 week).  
Responses ( immune -related partial response [ irPR] or irCR [complete response]) should be 
confirmed no less than [ADDRESS_1254102] 4 weeks later, but generally at the next scheduled tumor assessment time point in order to confirm immune -related progression disease ( irPD ). If repeat imaging shows 
a reduction in the tumor burden compared to the initial tumor assessment demonstrating PD, treatment may be continued as per treatment schedule.  If repeat imaging confirms irPD , 
subjects will be discontinu ed from study treatment.  In determining the tumor time point 
response, investigators should consider all target lesions as well as nontarget lesions and new lesions.   
The decision to continue study treatment after the first evidence of PD is at the Invest igator’s 
discretion based on the clinical status of the subject as described in Table 6 below.   
Subjects may continue receiving study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they 
are clinically stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) indicating disease progression  
• No decline in ECOG PS 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease  
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg , cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention

A schedule of biomarker sampling is shown in the  Schedule of Procedures/Assessments 
(Table 8  and Table 9 ).   
Blood samples for the development of exploratory predictive biomarkers will be collected prior to the first dose of study drug, on C1D15, and on D1  of all subsequent cycles during 
Treatment Phase, and at the Off- Tx assessment.  Subjects will be required to provide an 
archival tumor tissue sample and/or a fresh biopsy of tumor before treatment for biomarker analyses (patients with inaccessible tumors for biopsy specimens can be enrolled wit hout a 
biopsy upon consultation and agreement by [CONTACT_456]). For s ubjects in the NSCLC cohort 
every effort is to be made to obtain a fresh biopsy of tumor at the beginning of C2 (optional for 
other cohorts on study) if they have recovered adequately from the biopsy taken prior to starting therapy and to provide the acquired tissue for these biomarker analyses.  Biomarker 
discovery and/or validation will be performed to identify blood or tumor biomarkers which 
may be useful to predict subject response to lenvatinib and/or pembrolizumab, as determined by [CONTACT_894874]- related and/or safety -related outcomes as well as for potential use 
in diagnostic development.  Blood samples from subjects receiving lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab may be analyzed using global proteomic methods, enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex bead- based immunoassay, or other assays/methods 
or new technology.  In addition, biomarkers identified in other lenvatinib clinical studies may also be assessed in the biomarker samples collected from subjects enrolled in this study.  The decision to perform exploratory biomarker analysis may be based on the clinical outcome of this study and/or the signals observed in other clinical studies or other information available at that time.  
Archived, formalin- fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue or a newly obtained biopsy will 
be collected from all subjects for potential assessment of mutations and other genetic alterations and/or proteins including PD -1/PD -L1 status and other relevant biomarkers (eg, 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, T- cell repertoire, ribonucleic acid [RNA] signature [CONTACT_385502]), 
which  may be important in the developme nt and progression of cancer as well as for 
potential use in diagnostic development.  Appropriate technology/methodologies will be used based on the amount of tumor tissue available.  
Note:  For PD -1/PD -L1 status, submission of FFPEtumor tissue sample block s are preferred; 
if submitting unstained slides, the slides should be freshly cut and submitted to the 
testing laboratory within 14 days from the site slide sectioning date; otherwise, a new specimen will be requested.  
As of Amendment 06, available known m utation status , including mismatch repair (MMR) or 
microsatellite instability (MSI) status , will be collected  on the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ).

 For all tumor types except NSCLC, optional fresh paired tumor biopsies will be collected 
from consented  subjects to examine markers including markers of target engagement, 
relevant pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and potential markers of response.  Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible tumor lesions ( eg, skin; peripheral lymph nodes; liver 
meta stases which can be readily accessed using CT guidance).  Subjects should have the 
biopsy before administration of the first dose of study drug and at a time point [ADDRESS_1254105] dose (if they have recovered adequately from the biopsy taken prior to starting therapy).   For NSCLC every effort is to be made to obtain a fresh tumor biopsy; subjects will 
have fresh tumor biopsies collected from consented subjects before administration of the first dose of study drug and at a time point [ADDRESS_1254106] dose (if they have recovered 
adequately from the biopsy taken prior to starting therapy). 
As of Amendment 01, a blood sample for peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and 
plasma isolation
 will be collected from enrolled subjects.  Cell free nucleic acid isolated from 
plasma samples may be used to obtain circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) and explore tumor 
genetic alterations such as mutations observed in archival tumor samples as well as those 
which develop during drug treatment.  
In Phase 2, as of Amendment 4, a blood sample for nucleic acid analysis will be collected for 
potential assessment of gene expression profiling.  In Phase 2, as of Amendment 3, a blood sample will be collected for poten tial pharmacodynamics and pharmcogenomic analysis.  
Variation in lenvatinib exposure or the occurrence of AE s observed in the study population 
may be evaluated by [CONTACT_3541]–nucleotide polymorphisms with PK, safety, or pharmacodynamic data.  Genomi c DNA extracted from blood samples may be used to 
confirm whether the DNA sequence variants observed in DNA extracted from tumor material are limited to the tumor, for potential microsatellite instability analysis, and for potential immune response monitoring.  Data obtained will be used for research to assist in developi[INVESTIGATOR_894832].  The DNA will not be used to determine or predict 
risks for diseases that an individual subject does not currently have.  Any sample or 
derivatives (DNA, RNA, and protein) may be stored for up to [ADDRESS_1254107] in any research scientific questions related to lenvatinib/pembrolizumab, cancer and/or for potential diagnostic development.

 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1254108].   For this study, the investigational products are 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab.  
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product ( Note:  Every sign or 
symptom should not be listed as a separa te AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE.) 
• Any new disease or exac erbation of an existing disease. However, worsening of the 
primary disease should be captured under efficacy assessments as disease progression rather than as a n AE.  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol- required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg , ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study drug 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)  
• An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study drug, or withholding of study drug, whether pr escribed in the protocol or not .
 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF and for [ADDRESS_1254109] dose of study treatment . Subjects 
who fail s creening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen failure 
reported.  SAEs will be collected for [ADDRESS_1254110] dose of study treatment and reported on the Survival CRF. 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.  
Abnormal ECG ( QTc) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc interval is more than 450 ms 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001 -111

Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 95 of 155  
 and there is an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline.  Any ECG abnormality that the 
investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such. 
Progression of malignant disease (PD) sh ould not be recorded as an AE  in studies where it is 
included as an endpoint for underlying disease.  If the progression leads to an untoward 
medical occurrence (increased pain, pleural effusion, etc), then this medical occurrence should be the AE . 
All AEs  must be followed for [ADDRESS_1254111]’s last dose, or until resolution, 
whichever comes first.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, 
to stabilization.  
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_256391].  
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be graded on a 5 -point scale according to Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Event ( CTCAE v 4.03) ( Appendix 3) .  Investigators will report CTCAE grades 
for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing severity).   
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the event  
• The presence of nonstudy, treatment- related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event  
Classification of Causality  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the following question: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE? Yes (related)  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility. 
No (not related) A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility.

 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1254112] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie , the subject was at immediate risk of death fro m the AE  as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug)  
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations.  
Events of clinical interest for this study  include: 
1.  an elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is greater than or equal to 3 × ULN and 
an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is  greater than or equal to 2 × ULN and, at 
the same time, an ALP  laboratory value that is less than 2 × ULN, as determined by 
[CONTACT_13149]- specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing. 
Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The study site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can  be found in the Investigator Trial 
File Binder (or equivalent).   It may also be appropriate to conduct additional 
evaluation for an underlying etiology in the setting of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and ALP  that do not meet the criteria noted 
above.  In these cases, the decision to proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Director.  However, abnormalities of liver blood tests that do no t meet the criteria 
noted above are not events of clinical interest  for this trial.  
In addition to the above, events associated with special situations include pregnancy or 
exposure to study drug through breastfeeding; and AEs associated with study drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medication error.  These events associated with special situations are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet one of the above criteria.  All AEs associated with  special situations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.   
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.

 All hematology, blood chemistry (including pregnancy test, as applicable), and urinalysis 
samples are to be obtained prior to study drug administration and results reviewed prior to administration/dispensing of study drug at the beginning of each treatment cycle.  
A laboratory abnormality  may meet the criteria to qualify as an AE as described in this 
protocol (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 and the CRF Completion Guidelines (CCG) .  In these 
instances, the AE corresponding to the laboratory abnormality will be recorded on the 
Adverse Event CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 V ITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS  
Vital sign measurements (ie , systolic and diastolic BP [mmHg], heart rate  [beats per minute], 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [per minute], body temperature [in centigrade]), and weight ( kg) will be 
obtained at the visits designated i n the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 8  and 
Table 9 ) by a validated method.  Blood pressure and heart rate  will be measured after the 
subject has been resting for [ADDRESS_1254114] 5 minutes apart.  
For subjects with an elevated BP ( ie, systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg), 
confirmation should be obtained by [CONTACT_894875] a minimum of 1 -hour apart.   
Subjects with systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ [ADDRESS_1254115] their BP 
monitored every 2 weeks (on D1  and Day 15 or more frequently, as clinically indicated) until 
systolic BP has been ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP has been ≤95 mmHg for 3 consecutive months.  See subsection for management of hypertensive subjects ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2).  
Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only.   
[IP_ADDRESS].5 P HYSICAL EXAMINATIONS  
Physical examinations including oral examinations will be performed as designated i n the 
Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 8  and Table 9 ).  Documentation of the physical 
and oral examination will be included in the source documentation at the site.  Only changes from screening physical or oral examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will 
be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.

 An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see  
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1) and th e CCGs .  In these instances, the AE corresponding to the ECG 
abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. 
QT prolongation has been seen in some lenvatinib studies.  Monitor electrocardiograms 
every cycle (as specified in the Schedule of Assessments) in patients with congenital long QT 
syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics.   Refer to the 
Lenvatinib package insert.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7 E CHO CARDIOGRAM OR MULTIPLE GATED ACQUISITION SCAN  
A MUGA scan ( using technetium -based tracer ) or an echocardiogram will be performed to 
assess LVEF as designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 8  and Table 
9).  MUGA or echocardiogram scans should be performed locally in accordance with the 
institution’s standard practice .  MUGA scans are the preferred modality; however, whichever 
modality is used for an individual subject at baseline should be repeated for all subsequent LVEF assessments for that subject.  LVEFs as assessed by [CONTACT_113805].  Investigator assessment will be based upon institutional reports.  
All scans performed during the study should be archived in accordance with the standard local practice .  They must be accessible in the event of a sponsor request to submit them for

Optional fresh paired tumor biopsies will be collected at the baseline and the beginning of Cycle 2 from consented subjects (additional separate consent required) to examine markers including markers of target engag ement, relevant pharmacodynamic  biomarkers, and potential markers of response.   
r. Collection of blood sample to obtain plasma, serum, or other components to be used for biomarker studies.  Samples will be obtained at baseline, C1D15, D1 of all subsequent cycles up to and including C18, and at the off-treatment assessment.  
s. Subjects with NSCLC require a newly obtained tumor biopsy for biomarker analysis which must be obtained prior to the first dose.  If an archival tumor sample for biomarker analysis is not available from subjects with RCC, EC, UC, M, or HNSCC, then a newly obtained tumor biopsy must be obtained prior to the first dose.  If a newly obtained 
biopsy is required, it is preferred that the biopsy is obtained from a non-target lesion.  Subjects  must have recovered adequately from the biopsy prior to starting therapy .

markers including markers of target engagement, relevant pharmacodynamic  biomarkers, and potential markers of response.  
r. Collection of blood sample to obtain plasma, serum, nuclei c acid , or other components to be used for biomarker studies.  Samples will be ob tained at baseline, C1D 15, D1 
of all subsequent cycles up to and including C18, and at the off-treatment assessment.  
s. For subjects with NSCLC, every effort is to be made to obtain  a newly obtained tumor biopsy for biomarker analysis which must be obtained prior to the first dose.  If an 
archival tumor sample for biomarker analysis is not available from subjects with RCC, EC, UC, M, or HNSCC, then a newly obtai ned tumor biopsy  must be obtained prior to 
the first dose.  If a new biopsy is obtained, it is preferred that the biopsy is obtained from a non- target lesion.  Subjects must have recovered adequately from the biopsy prior 
to starting therapy .

Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 115 of 155 
 Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24 hours of its 
receipt.  If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s assessment of causality, this 
should also be noted on the follow- up SAE form.  
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_123273][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, and other documents requested by [CONTACT_456]. 
The investigator must notify his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE in writing, if 
required by [CONTACT_1385].  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to the sponsor to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.  
Eisai will provide a Safety Reporting Plan (SRP) for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab.  The plan will address the following:  
• Holder of the Global Safety Database 
• Procedures and timelines for the processing of SAEs 
• The distribution of expedited SAE reports  
• Responsibility for submission to Health Authorities and notifications to investigators and  the EC/IRB 
• Adverse Events of Special Interest reports including pregnancy reports, and overdose 
• Case closure 
• SAE reconciliation  
• Translation of source documents  
• Schematic of work flow and t imelines  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding 
Any pregnancy in which the estimated date of conception is either before the last visit or within [ADDRESS_1254163] be reported .  
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study treatment.  
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous abortion are considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same time frame and in the same format as all other SAEs (see  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Events Associated with Special Situations  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 R EPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG 
OVERDOSE , MISUSE , ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer to AEs as sociated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by [CONTACT_760].  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:  
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study drug in an amount higher than 
the protocol-defined dose  
Misuse  Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with the 
protocol  
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug 
accompanied by [CONTACT_894878].   
All AEs associated with overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error should be captured  on 
the Adverse Event CRF  and also  reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) even if the AEs do not meet seri ous criteria.  Abuse 
is always to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or 
medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF. 
Note:  Overdose for pembrolizumab is defined as a dose greater than 5 times the 200 mg 
dose. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Reporting  
The sponsor must inform investigators and regulatory authorities of repor table  events, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (ie , within

Eisai  
Final: 30 July 2021  Confidential  Page 117 of 155 
 specific time frames).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE 
information in the manner described above. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Breaking the Blind 
Not applicable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_3210] a third party acting on behalf of the sponsor to regulatory authorities in compliance with local and regional law and established guidance.  The format of these repor ts will be dictated by [CONTACT_879454].  
All studies that are conducted within any European country will comply with European Good Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28/EC and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.  All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported, as required, to 
the competent authorities of all involved European member states. 
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects  
A subject may elect to discontinue the study at any time for any reason.  All subj ects who 
discontinue the study are to complete the study’s early discontinuation procedures indicated 
in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 8  and Table 9 ). 
The investigator will promptly explain to the subject involved that the study will be discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by [CONTACT_2319], phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment  compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs 
and symptoms.   
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for 1 of these primary 
reasons: AE (s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, progression of disease, withdrawal of 
consent, pregnancy, study terminated by [CONTACT_3211], or other.  In addition to the primary reason, the subject may indicate 1 or more secondary reason(s) for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be collected on the Subject Disposition CRF.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 P RIMARY ENDPOINTS  
Primary Efficacy E ndpoint for Phase 1b:  
The primary objective of Phase 1b is to determine the DLTs, MTD, and to establish the 
RP2D.  The efficacy endpoints in Phase 1b will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_894880].  No statistical comparison will be performed.   
 
Primary  Effica cy Endpoint for Phase 2:  
The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate ORR
(Week 24)  in each of the cohorts using 
irRECIST .  ORR (Week 24)  is defined as the proportion of subjects who have best overall 
response ( BOR) of irCR (Week 24)  or irPR (Week 24)  as of the Week [ADDRESS_1254168] completed 8 cycles of treatment, discontinued due to disease progression, 
developed unacceptable toxicity, withdrew consent, or the study is terminated by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 S ECONDARY ENDPOINTS  (BOTH PHASE 1B AND PHASE 2) 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be ORR, PFS, OS, DCR, CBR, DOR,  and durable SD  
rate (SD ≥ 23 weeks) by [CONTACT_894851].  The secondary eff icacy endpoints are 
defined as follows.  
• ORR  is defined as the proportion of subjects who have BOR of irCR or irPR at the time 
of data cutoff.   
• PFS is defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first 
documentation of confirmed disease progression or death (whichever occurs first).   If a 
subject has not experienced disease progression or death, then the subject’s data will be censored at the date of the last available tumor assessment.  
• OS is measured from the start date of the tr eatment period until date of death from any 
cause. Subjects who are lost to follow-up and the subjects who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the subject was last known alive.  
• DCR  is defined as the proportion of subjects who have BOR of irCR or irPR or irSD 
(duration of irSD ≥ 5 weeks).  
• CBR  is defined as the proportion of subjects who have BOR of irCR or irPR or durable 
irSD (duration of irSD ≥ 23 weeks). 
• DOR  is defined as the time from the date the criteria are met for an irCR or irPR 
(whichever is recorded first) to the date the disease progression is objectively

more than 3 responses, then approximately 40 additional subjects will be enrolled.  At the 
second interim analysis (N = 60), if there are more than 12 responses, approximately 60 additional subjects will be enrolled.  If there are 12 or fewer responses, the sponsor may decide whether to expand enrollment based on clinical outcome, eg, ORR and DOR.  If the expansion beyond 60 subjects does not happen, this design for the EC  cohort has 
approximately 86% power at 2- sided 𝛼𝛼 = 0.02.  The boundaries for the decision to expand

Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001-111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: [ADDRESS_1254198] are: 
• IrRECIST allows the site to select up to ten (10) target lesions at baseline, five (5) per 
organ, if clinically relevant via CT/MRI scans or by [CONTACT_894891].  The ability to continue treatment, if clinically stable, until repeat imaging 
scans ≥ 4 weeks later (in most cases at the next scanning time point  6 weeks later) to 
confirm immune -relater p rogressive disease (irPD) 
irRECIST Lexicon  
1.  Baseline Assessments  
Measurable 
(Target) lesions  
 Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a minimum size of: 
• [ADDRESS_1254199] diameter (LDi) by [CONTACT_28842] (or no less 
than double the slice thickness) for non- nodal lesi ons and ≥15 mm in 
short axis (SDi) for nodal lesions  
• 10 mm in LDi for clinical lesions (must be measured using electronic calipers)  
• Identify up to 10 lesions, not more than 5 from one organ system. 
Lymph nodes are considered one organ system 
• Likely to be reproducible across all time points 
• Representative of tumor burden 
• May include lesions in previously irradiated areas ONLY if there is demonstrated progression in that lesion after irradiation  
• Sum of diameters (SOD) of all target lesions including nodal and 
non-nodal are reported as baseline SOD , which is used for assessing 
tumor response at follow-up time points 
Bone lesions 
 Regardless of the imaging modality, blastic bone lesions will not be  
selected as target lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with a 
measurable soft tissue component ≥10 mm can be selected as target 
lesions.  
Cystic and 
Necrotic 
Lesions as Target Lesions Lesions that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected  as target 
lesions. The LDi of such a lesion will be added to the SOD of all target 
lesions at baseline. If other lesions with a nonliquid/nonnecrotic component are present, those should be preferred. 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001-111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: [ADDRESS_1254200] will consider information on the anatomical sites of previous intervention (eg, previous irradiation, 
RF-ablation, TACE, surgery).  Lesions undergoing prior intervention will 
not be selected as target lesions unless there has been a demonstration of progression in the lesion. 
Nonmeasurable (Non target) 
lesions  
 Nontarget lesions will include:  
• Measurable lesions not selected as target lesions.  There is no limit to 
the number of nontarget lesions that can be recorded at baseline 
• Other types of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic 
tissue, but are difficult to measure in a reproducible manner.  These 
include bone metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, malignant ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill -defined 
abdominal masses, etc.  
• Multiple non target lesions from the same organ may be captured as 
a single item on the eCRF ( eg, multiple liver metastases)  
Nontarget lesions should be reported as present at baseline  
SOD baseline  Sum of diameters at baseline = LDi of all non -nodal + SDi of all nodal 
target lesions  
2.  Time  point Assessments After Baseline  
Target lesion 
measurements Locate image that optimizes the LDi of the non -nodal target lesion or SDi  
of target node(s).  There is no need to go to an identical slice from baseline.  
Measure the respective LDi and SDi for all target lesions and calculate time point SOD (SOD 
timepoint ). 
Special consideration for target lesions:  
• If target lesion is too small to measure, a default value of 5mm 
should be entered on eCRF. 
• If target lesion is 5 -10mm, actual diameter should be entered in the 
eCRF .  
• If target lesion splits into [ADDRESS_1254201] of that lesion . 
• If two target lesion merged to form one lesion than LDi of one 
should be entered as “ 0mm ” while the other lesion should have the 
diameter of the merged lesion . 
Nontarget 
Lesion 
Assessment  
 Nontarget lesions are evaluated qualitatively as present, absent, not 
evaluable (NE) or unequivocal progression.  The response of nontarget lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR.   
Nontarget lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments.  Only a 
massive and unequivocal worsening of nontarget lesions alone, even in 
the presence of stable disease or a partial response in the target lesion is 
Clinical Study Protocol   E7080 -A001-111 
 
 
Eisai  
Final: [ADDRESS_1254202] be used by [CONTACT_978] . 
• May include a lesion in an anatomical location that was not scanned 
at baseline ( ie, brain)  
• Should be unequivocal and not due to differences in scanning 
technique 
• If equivocal, should be assessed at next time point ; if present, irPD 
is the date the lesion was first seen (not the date confirmed)  
3.  irRECIST Overall Tumor Assessment  
  
irCR • Complete disappearance of all measurable and nonmeasurable 
lesions (from baseline) and there are no unequivocal new lesions 
(unconfirmed irCR).  
• Lymph nodes must decrease to < 10 mm in SDi. 
• Confirmation of response is required ≥ 4 weeks later, preferably at 
next time point, to be considered a confirmed irCR. 
irPR  • If the SOD timepoint of TLs decreases by ≥30 % compared to 
SOD baseline  and there are no unequivocal new lesions, and no 
progression of nontarget disease, it is an irPR (unconfirmed).  
• Confirmation is required ≥ 4 weeks later,  preferably at next time 
point, to be considered a confirmed irPR. 
irSD  Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD.  
• If the sum of the TLs and the status of the nontarget lesions do not 
reach the criteria to meet irPR or irPD (increase ≥20% and at least 5 
mm absolute increase in SOD compared to nadir†) the response is irSD.  
• irSD = neither 30% decrease compared to SOD
baseline  or 20% 
increase  and at least 5 mm absolute change compared to nadir.  
• †SOD nadir: Lowest measure SOD of TLs at any time point from 
baseline onward.  
irPD  Minimum 20% increase and a minimum 5 mm absolute increase in SOD compared to nadir, or irPD for nontarget lesion(s) or unequivocal new lesion(s).  
• Confirmation of progression is recommended at a minimum of [ADDRESS_1254203] irPD assessment (preferably at next tumor assessment time point ). 
The decision to continue study treatment after the first ev idence of PD is 
at the investigator’s discretion based on the clinical status of the subject

Subjects may continue receiving study treatment while waiting for 
confirmation of irPD if they are clinically stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory 
values) indicating disease progression  
• No decline in ECOG performance status  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease  
• Absence of pr ogressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg , cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention

been correlated with single -concept (MedDRA) terms.  
The CTCAE  v4.03 grading refers to the severity of the AE.  The CTCAE  grades 1 through 5, 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, are based on this general guideline: 
Grade  CTCAE Status  
1 Mild:  asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate:  minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening: 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling, limiting 
self-care ADLb 
4 Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to adverse event 
ADL = activities of daily living, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  
a:  Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
b:  Self -care A DL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.

 Appendix 4 [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Cardiac Disease 
Classification  
The NYHA  Cardiac Disease Classification provides a functional and therapeutic 
classification for the prescription of physical activity for heart failure patients based on  
cardiac functional capacity.  Based on NYHA definitions, subjects are to be classified as 
follows:  
Class  NYHA Status 
Class I:  Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical 
activity; ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain.  
Class II:  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity; 
they are comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
Class III:  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of activity; they are 
comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], 
dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
Class IV:  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical 
activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or angina syndrome 
may be present even at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.  
NYHA = [LOCATION_001] Heart Association.

 Appendix 5 Clinical Studies Evaluati ng Drug –Drug Interactions 
with Lenvatinib  
Nonclinical studies identify CYP3A4 as a potentially important CPY isozyme responsible for 
metabolism of lenvatinib.  Clinical studies were conducted to test these findings.  
Simultaneous CYP3A4/ P-gp inhibition by [CONTACT_763088] (15% to 19%) increases 
systemic exposure to lenvatinib ( Shumaker , et al., 2015) .  Since no change was observed in 
half- life, t max, or lag time (t lag), the slight increase in systemic exposure is probably related to 
a decrease in first pass metabolism.  However, since the magnitude of change is small, co -
administration of lenvatinib with CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors is not of clinical concern.  
The influence of P-gp inhibition on lenvatinib PK has been investigated.  P-gp inhibition was 
accomplished by [CONTACT_3252]-administering a single dose of rifampin with a single dose of lenvatinib.  
Preliminary results suggest P -gp inhibition increases systemic exposure to lenvatinib 26% to 
32%.  Thus, co- administration of lenvatinib with P -gp inhibitors only causes a small increase 
in lenvatinib exposure.  
The influence of simultaneous P-gp and CYP3A4 induction on lenvatinib PK has been 
investigated.  Examination of simultaneous P-gp and CYP3A4 induction on lenvatinib PK was accomplished by [CONTACT_894892] 21 days ( Shumaker, et al., 2014 ).  A 
single dose of lenvatinib was co -administered with the 15th dose of rifampin.  Based on 
preliminary data, simultaneous P- gp and CYP3A4 induction minimally altered lenvatinib 
exposure as mean C
max increased about  8% while AUC decreased about 7%.  Co-
administration of lenvatinib with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers is not of clinical concern.

Eisai  
Final: [ADDRESS_1254206] biologic samples collected for 
pharmacodynamic, PG, and other biomarker analysis.  These samples may be used for 
discovery and validation to identify biomarkers that may be used for exploratory evaluation of response and/or safety- related  outcomes as well as for use in diagnostic development. 
The PG samples may be used to identify genetic factors that may influence a subject’s exposure to the study drug, as well as genetic factors that may have an effect on clinical response or potential AEs related to study treatment, and to explore the role of genetic 
variability in response.  Samples may be analyzed to determine a subject’s genotypes or sequence for a number of genes or non-coding regulatory regions.  The research may include the investigation of polymorphisms in genes that are likely to influence the study drug pharmacokinetics or therapeutic response. 
Collection of the pharmacodynamic, PG, and other biomarker samples will be bound by [CONTACT_894893].  Sample collection for pharmacodynamic, PG, and other biomarker analysis is required as per the study protocol unless the collection  and use of the samples is prohibited by [CONTACT_427950].  
Sample Collection and Handling 
The samples will be collected according to the study flow chart.  If, for operational or 
medical reasons, the genomic DNA blood sample cannot be obtained at the prespecified visit, the sample can be taken at any study center visit at the discretion of the investigator and site staff.  
Security of the Samples, Use of the Samples, Retention of the Samples  
Sample processing, for example DNA and/or RNA extraction, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], sequencing, or other analysis will be performed by a laboratory under the direction of the sponsor.  Processing, analysis, and storage will be performed at a secure laboratory facility to protect the validity of the data and maintain subject privacy. 
Samples will only be used for the purposes described in this protocol.  Laboratories 
contracted to perform the analysis on behalf of the sponsor will not retain rights to the samples beyond those necessary to perform the specified analysis and will not transfer or sell those samples.  The sponsor will not sell the samples to a third party.  
Samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the completion of the study (defined as submission of the clinical study report to the appropriate regulatory agencies).  At the end of the storage period, samples will be destroyed.  Samples may be stored longer if a health authority (or medicinal product approval agency) has active questions about the study.  In this special circumstance, the samples will be stored until  the questions have been adequately 
addressed.

Final: [ADDRESS_1254207] of future testing, all samples collected will be single or double coded (according to the ICH E15 guidelines) in order to maintain subject privacy.  
Right to Withdraw  
If, during the time the samples are stored, a participant would like to withdraw his/her 
consent for participation in this research, Eisai will destroy the samples.  Information from any assays that have already been completed at the time of withdrawal of consent will continue to be used as necessary to prot ect the integrity of the research project.  
Subject Privacy and Return of Data 
No subject-identifying information (eg, initials, date of birth, government identifying 
number) will be associated with the sample.  All pharmacodynamic and other biomarker samples will be single coded.  Genomic DNA samples used to explore the effects on PK, treatment response, and safety will be single coded .  Genomic DNA samples that will be 
stored for long-term use (defined as 15 years after the completion of the study) will be double coded.  Double coding involves removing the initial code (subject ID) and replacing with another code such that the subject can be re-identified by [CONTACT_2363] [ADDRESS_1254208] access to the “key.”  Clini cal data collected as part of the clinical trial 
will be cleaned of subject identifying information and linked by [CONTACT_3256] “key.” 
The sponsor will take steps to ensure that data are protected accordingly and confidentiality 
is maintained as far  as possible.  Data from subjects enrolled in this study may be analyzed 
worldwide, regardless of location of collection. 
The sponsor and its representatives and agents may share coded data with persons and 
organizations involved in the conduct or oversigh t of this research.  These include:  
• Clinical research organizations retained by [CONTACT_456]  
• Independent ethics committees or institutional review boards that have responsibility for this 
research study  
• National regulatory authorities or equivalent government agencies  
At the end of the analysis, results may be presented in a final report which can include part or 
all of the coded data, in listing or summary format.  Other publication (eg, in peer- reviewed 
scientific journals) or public presentation of the study results will only include summaries of the population in the study, and no identified individual results will be disclosed.

Therefore, these results will not be disclosed to the patients or their physicians.  
If at any time, pharmacodynamic, PG, and/or other biomarker results are obtained that may have clinical relevance, IRB review and approval will be sought to determine the most appropriate manner of disclosure and to determine whether or not validation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified setting will be required.  Sharing of research data with individual patients should only occur when data have been validated by [CONTACT_427951]- approved laboratories.

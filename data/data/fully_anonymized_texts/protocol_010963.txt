INTRODUCTION
 
 
Transbronchial Lung Biopsy 
 
General Considerations
 
Transbronchial Lung Biopsy (TBLB) is one of the most important applications of flexible 
bronchoscopy. The procedure, initially introduced by [CONTACT_481246] 1965 for use via a rigid 
bronchoscope 
(1)
, became more widely performed after it was adapted for use with the flexible 
bronchoscope in the early 1970s 
(2)
 
for the evaluation of localized as well as diffuse pulmonary 
disease. Today, TBLB is regularly performed by 69% of practicing physicians documented in a 
survey of 1,700 North American pulmonary and critical care physicians 
(3)
. This indispensable 
procedure, which may be performed under fluoroscopic guidance, constitutes a diagnostic 
alternative to percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy, thoracoscopy with forceps lung biopsy, 
and thoracotomy with open lung biopsy. Apart from m
astering the technique, the bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_481118] a thorough understanding of indications, limitations, and immediate complications of 
the TBLB. When properly performed, several studies have established the safety of TBLB in an 
outpatient setting under 
moderate sedation 
(4,5)
. 
 
Biopsy forceps commonly used for TBLB via the flexible bronchoscope are generally of the order 
of 3 mm or smaller in any given dimension. Because of this restriction in size, tissue samples 
obtained via the transbronchial approach are generally 2
–
3 mm in a
ny dimension. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_481119], TBLB provides information regarding pathology that is located beyond the 
cartilaginous airways that may include elements of the small airways of the distal bronchial tree, 
the alveolar space, the vasculature, and lymph
atic structures immediately surrounding the alveoli 
(6)
. Pulmonary diseases that require examination of larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_481120], such as many of the 
idiopathic interstitial lung diseases, are generally not amenable to diagnos
is by [CONTACT_481247]
-
assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy ,which has been shown to have a 
greater diagnostic yield 
(7,8)
, should be pursued. With these limitations in mind, TBLB is useful 
for the diagnosis of a variety of infectious, interstitial, and malignant pulmonary diseases, 
including pulmonary infiltrates in the immunocompromised host 
(9,10)
, sarcoidosis 
(11,12)
, 
eosinophilic lung disease 
(13,14)
, drug
-
induced pneumonitis 
(15)
, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 
(16)
, lung cancer 
(17)
, pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis 
(18,19)
, and acute allograft 
rejection in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(20,21)
. Absolute contraindications for TBLB include 
inability to obtain informed consent, severe or refractory hypoxemia, uncontrolled 
bronchospasm, and unstable cardiovascular condition, including active ischemia and 
uncontrolled arrhythmia. Relative contraindi
cations include uncorrected coagulopathy, platelet 
count of less than 50 K/μL, severe pulmonary hypertension, uncooperative patient, inability to 
control cough, and lack of resuscitation facilities 
(22,23)
. 
 
 
Technique
 
A thorough airway examination usually precedes the TBLB because bleeding after lung biopsy 
may preclude its performance. Adequate control of cough with topi[INVESTIGATOR_481121] 
5
 
 
and systemic administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_481122] 
(24)
.
 
The choice of biopsy site depends on radiological and fluoroscopic findings. Generally, TBLB is 
not attempted from both lungs during the same bronchoscopic procedure on the same date due 
to risk of bilateral pneumothorax. For selection of the site for the 
TBLB in the case of diffuse lung 
disease, some providers prefer to perform the biopsy from the dependent parts of the lungs; 
right and left lower lobes 
(23)
. In an event of bleeding, the blood is more likely to remain 
contained in this area before spi[INVESTIGATOR_481123] 
(25)
. The procedure can be 
performed “blindly” or under fluoroscopic guidance when available. 
 
There is limited information on the optimal number of transbronchial biopsies in various lung 
disease. In general, four to six biopsy specimens are adequate in a majority of patients with 
diffuse lung disease 
(26)
. For acute graft rejection surveillance in lung and lung
-
heart transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], most transplant centers will obtain at least 5 and up to 10 biopsies per procedure 
(20,27)
.
 
 
Hemorrhagic Complications
 
TBLB is generally safe, although severe and life threatening procedure
-
related complications are 
occasionally encountered, most common among them are pneumothorax and procedure
-
related 
hemorrhage. Significant bleeding related to TBLB has been traditionally
 
attributed to laceration 
of a bronchial artery 
(28)
. Established risk factors for clinically significant bleeding following TBLB 
include bleeding diathesis including thrombocytopenia 
(29)
, use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant 
medications 
(30,31)
, pulmonary hypertension 
(32)
, advanced renal failure 
(33)
, and immune 
compromised state 
(34)
. The propensity to bleed following TBLB was also shown to be related to 
the type of forceps used with some evidence suggesting that bleeding complications are less 
common with alligator forceps as opposed to cup forceps 
(35,36)
. According to a recent 
retrospective population
-
based study from the [LOCATION_003] incorporating data from almost 100,000 
patient visits involving TBLB, the overall rate for procedure
-
related clinically significant 
hemorrhage was 0.58% 
(37)
. Another survey from Japan reviewing over 100,000 procedures, 
among them 57,199 forceps biopsies, recorded a bleeding rate of 0.73% 
(38)
. Death related to 
airway bleeding in association with bronchoscopic procedures is exceedingly rare 
(39,40)
.
 
Quantification of TBLB
-
related bleeding is difficult, subjective, and prone to observer bias. 
Although not formally adopted, several grading systems have been suggested for the purpose of 
quantification of procedure
-
related hemorrhage. Most published studi
es use grading systems 
that rely on the amount of mixed blood and bronchial wash fluid in the vacuum suction system 
at the end of the procedure 
(5,38,41,42)
. This method may be prone to measurement errors in 
estimation of the actual extent of blood loss during the procedure due to dilution of blood with 
other airway secretions as well as fluid administered via the bronchoscope working channel such 
as saline. 
A recently published study exploring the safety of percutaneous bronchoscopy
-
guided 
tracheostomy in thoracic transplantation patients suggested a grading system that classifies 
endobronchial hemorrhage as mild, moderate, or severe based on the most proxima
l bronchus 
in the bronchial tree obstructed by [CONTACT_481248] 
(43)
. Among the other grading scales described 
in the literature thus far, the one suggested by [CONTACT_481249]. 
(44)
 
may have to most clinical 
relevance. This scale grades airway bleeding according to the action implemented by [CONTACT_941] 
6
 
 
operator in order to achieve hemostasis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_481124] a 
subsequent study 
(45)
, it seems that a bias may be introduced into this system by [CONTACT_481250]. Indeed, there is lack of agreement in currently availab
le literature 
as to the best approach to achieve control over the bleeding lung. In general, one school of 
thought supports the wedging technique, first described by [CONTACT_481251] 1975 
(46)
, where the 
bronchoscope is wedged into the bleeding bronchus in effort to allow enough time for a clot to 
form and at the same time prevent spi[INVESTIGATOR_481125] 
(23)
. The 
other main school of thought argues for a “back and forth” or “in and out” maneuver that 
includes positioning of the bronchoscope proximal to the bleeding bronchus and suctioning of 
blood as it emerges from the airway in order to avoid coagulation in
 
the airway, which can block 
the suctioning channel and also obscure vision 
(47)
. 
 
As mentioned above, the main danger of TBLB
-
related bleeding is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_481126]
-
involved bronchial tree rather than exsanguination. Therefore, priority should be given to 
prevention of flooding of the airways with blood. Fortunately, m
ost cases of major airway 
bleeding following TBLB can be managed in the bronchoscopy suite. Apart from positioning the 
bronchoscope in the airway as mentioned above, other measures to achieve hemostasis. These 
include placing the patient in a lateral decub
itus position with the bleeding lung in the dependent 
position and application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 4°C saline 
(48)
 
and/or vasopressors such as 
cocaine or diluted epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(49,50)
. The dosing of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481127]. Review of the literature 
revea
ls epi[INVESTIGATOR_481128] 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 and the volume 
of instillation ranges of 0.5 and up to 20 mL 
(22,50
–
52)
. The British Thoracic Society guidelines 
on diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy suggest small aliquots of 1:10,000 diluted epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(49)
. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_481129] a measure of achieving hemostasis was also 
previously described in case series 
(53,54)
. Bleeding refractory to conservative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481130]’s working channel 
(23,49)
. Inability to control bleeding with those interventions 
should prompt securing the airway with endotracheal intubation. Additionally, selective 
intubation of the non
-
bleeding lung and application of an endobronchial blocker may be 
considered along with ad
vanced interventions such as selective bronchial artery embolization 
(55,56)
. 
 
Local practices in University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) for the initial treatment of 
endobronchial bleeding in the bronchoscopy suite includes administration of iced saline in 
aliquots of 5
-
10 mL followed by 1
-
2 mL aliquots of 1:10,000 topi[INVESTIGATOR_481131] (0.1
-
0.2 mg) to a 
maximum of 6 mL (0.6 mg). Additional suggested measures include positioning the patient with 
the bleeding lung in the dependent position and balloon tamponade of the bleeding airway with 
application of a 2
-
4 FR embolectomy balloon
 
catheter (Edwards Lifesciences®) via the 
bronchoscope’s working channel before attempting more advanced methods to allow 
hemostasis.

The Role of Transbronchial Lung Biopsies in Lung Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481132] “gold standard” diagnostic modality 
for the assessment of lung allograft function and specifically acute cellular rejection (ACR) 
following lung transplantation. Most lung transplant programs now pe
rform TBLB for graft 
function surveillance, new onset symptoms, ≥10% decrease in FEV1, assessment of a new lung 
infiltrate on chest imaging, or as a follow
-
up for acute rejection or CMV pneumonitis 
(57)
. Acute 
rejection is an established risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome 
(BOS), and therefore it has been proposed that early detection and treatment is of paramount 
importance 
(58)
. The relatively high incidence of silent rejection or infection in asymptomatic 
patients has lent support for routine surveillance protocols 
(59,60)
. Surveillance protocols vary 
widely between transplantation centers since there is little data to guide the frequency of 
surveillance biopsies. The ACR surveillance protocol in UMMC includes routine bronchoscopy 
with TBLB at one
-
month post
-
transplant and 
then every three months for one year. Additional 
bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_481133], symptoms, or 
results of pulmonary function tests (PFT) 
(61)
. As in the general population, the most common 
complications of TBLB in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481134]. Generally, 
there is evidence that shows a higher propensity for procedure
-
related bleeding in the post lung 
and heart
-
lung tr
ansplant population. Once again, the recorded rate of clinically significant lung 
hemorrhage is highly dependent of the system adopted for grading of the amount of bleeding. 
In an early study by [CONTACT_452771]., bronchoscopy data from 83 lung transplant recipi
[INVESTIGATOR_481135]. The rate of clinically significant procedure
-
related bleeding, defined 
arbitrarily as >50 mL blood loss was 1.9% 
(62)
. Scott et al. prospectively evaluated the yield and 
complications of TBLB in 219 procedures on combined heart
-
lung transplant patients. Blood was 
recovered by [CONTACT_481252] 44% of procedures, while the rate of >100 mL 
procedure related bleed
ing was recorded at 12.3% 
(20)
. Bjørtuft et al. studied the rate of TBLB
-
related bleeding in [ADDRESS_618157] lung or heart
-
lung 
transplantation. The rate of clinically significant bleeding, arbitrarily defined is more than 20 mL, 
was 7.7%. No differe
nce in the rate or volume of clinically significant bleeding was observed 
between transplant and non
-
transplant patients. Interestingly, screening platelet count and 
coagulation tests did not predict bleeding risk in this study 
(63)
. A prospective cohort study 
performed at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions between [ADDRESS_618158] their 
procedure terminated prematurely due to bleeding in comparison to the non
-
transplant patients. 
Bronchoscopy procedu
res, including those where TBLB was performed, were significantly longer 
in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In a logistic regression analysis, worse hemoptysis was associated with 
lung transplant status, older age, and longer procedure time. As in prior studies, bl
eeding risk 
was independent of platelet count, coagulation studies, use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and use of 
immunosuppressive medications 
(64)
. The relation between risk of bleeding and procedure time 
might reflect a technically challenging procedure or in some cases prolongation of the procedure 
by [CONTACT_481253]. Other possible explanations for the increased propensity to bleed 
am
ong lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481136], ACR, or 
BOS or an increase in blood flow to the transplanted lung, particularly in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481137] 
8
 
 
transplants. Evidence from transplantation centers outside the [LOCATION_003] correlates with [LOCATION_003] reported 
numbers. For example, a study in performed in a single institution in Japan recorded a bleeding 
rate of 11% among 206 procedures on 28 lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]
s 
(65)
. Additional relevant 
studies include McWilliams, 2008 (includes additional citations: 1
-
5) and Smith, 2012.
 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_481138], also known as
 
adrenalin
 
or
 
adrenaline, is a non
-
selective agonist of all adrenergic 
receptors, including the major subtypes α1,
 
α2,
 
β1,
 
β2, and
 
β3. β
-
Adrenergic effects are more 
pronounced at low doses and α1
-
adrenergic effects at higher doses
. The rationale for the use of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_481139], minimization, and control of superficial bleeding is derived from its 
vasoconstrictive effect on arterioles and capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], mediated via activation of α1 receptors on 
blood vessel smooth muscle 
(66)
.
 
Although adopted by [CONTACT_481254]
-
related hemorrhage, the use of 
prophylactic instillation of diluted epi[INVESTIGATOR_481140]
-
associated bleeding is no
t established in the medical 
literature. Limited evidence from case series performed in a single institution suggest a beneficial 
effect of prophylactic injection of tranexamic acid into bleeding

prone endobronchial lesions 
such as tumors before attempting
 
endobronchial biopsies 
(67,68)
. 
 
The main body of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of prophylactic topi[INVESTIGATOR_481141], specifically 
endoscopic endonasal and sinus surgery, rhinoplasty, and surgical management of burn injuries. 
During functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and rhinoplasy, common practice involves 
administration of t
opi[INVESTIGATOR_481142] 1:1,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]
-
soaked neuropatties 
as well as intranasal injection of a mixed solution of local anesthetic and 1:100,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(69)
. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing cocaine
-
 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]
-
soaked 
neuropatties in 37 patients found no significant difference in blood loss with cocaine as compared 
to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. In this study, no adverse effects associated with cocaine or
 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_481143] 
(70)
. A non
-
randomized trial comparing cocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_75447] 65 patients 
undergoing rhinoplasty showed similar results 
(71)
. The reported rate of cardiovascular 
complications associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_481144] 0.1% or less 
(72,73)
 
with no deaths reported. In a series of 1,998 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus 
surgery in which 1:1000 diluted topi[INVESTIGATOR_481145], Orlandi 
et al.
 
reported two complications likely associated with the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_341404] (<0.1%). 
Once case involved ECG changes and the other case involved intraoperative hypertension due to 
inadvertent submucosal injection of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_440211] 
(73)
. In a more recent prospective 
series of 19 patients undergoing the same surgery using epi[INVESTIGATOR_481146] 
1:1000, there were no documented cases of altered hemodynamics related to topi[INVESTIGATOR_481147] 
(74)
. A study in 10 burn patients undergoing burn wound excision using 1:[ZIP_CODE] 
diluted epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]
-
soaked gauze wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], did not show a significant increase in 
intraoperative serum concentration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481148] 
(75)
. 
Nonetheless, a different study in burn patients has demonstrated that tachycardia was more 
common in burn patients undergoing surgery where 1:10,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]
-
soaked gauzes were 
used 
(76)
. This finding can be related to the relatively large interface between the applied 
[ADDRESS_618159] profile of 1:10,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]
-
soaked gauzes 
applied prophylactically  for hemostasis during laparoscopic chole
cystectomy 
(77)
.
 
 
Potential Adverse effects of Endotracheally
-
 
and Endobronchially
-
Administered Topi[INVESTIGATOR_481149]. 
Adverse hemodynamic effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481150]. Two 
pharmacokinetic studies in a canine model explored blood concentrations of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481151]. Roberts et al. compared blood concentrations and 
hemodynamic effect of intravenous (IV) versus endotracheal (E
T) instillation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481152] 0.005, 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 mg/kg diluted in 5 mL of normal saline. The 
authors reported that following ET installation, maximum blood concentrations of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481153]
-
tenth of tho
se achieved with an equal dose administered IV. 
Interestingly, while IV administered epi[INVESTIGATOR_481154], ET 
administration was characterized by a more sustained blood concentration. The same 
relationship between IV and ET admin
istration was observed when comparing pharmacological 
effects with the ET route requiring ten times the IV dose in order to result in a significant increase 
in blood pressure 
(78)
. Mazkereth et al. demonstrated significant measurable systemic levels 
when epi[INVESTIGATOR_75447] a dose of 0.02 mg/kg diluted in 2 mL of saline was administered into the 
airways using a catheter. More than a 4
-
fold increase in systemic levels was achieved when 
e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_481155] a catheter as compared with when it was 
administered into the trachea (maximal concentration 8.9±3.2 vs. 2.0±0.4 ng/mL).
 
However, 
neither group demonstrated any significant change in the heart rate, and 
both had similar, minor 
decreases in blood pressure for 2 to 5 minutes with no significant differences in arterial blood 
gases 
(79)
. It is noteworthy that the dose range of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481156]
-
related hemorrhage by a 
factor of [ADDRESS_618160] been made since the 1970s 
(80)
. 
Nevertheless, evidence of such adverse effects are scarce and the currently available data are 
mostly derived from cases where epi[INVESTIGATOR_481157], 
potentially resulting in direct contact [CONTACT_481255][INVESTIGATOR_481158]. Janjua et al. reported a case 
of coronary vasospasm manifesting as chest pain, ST
-
segment elevation, and ectopy induced by 
[CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_84751] 3 mL o
f 1:10,[ADDRESS_618161] between epi[INVESTIGATOR_481159]. Left heart 
catheterization in this patient revealed mild coronary atherosclerosis and he was discharged 5 
days later following an uneventful hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779] 
(81)
. A recent report of two cases implicating 
bronchoscopic administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481160]
-
associated bleeding as the trigger for 
10
 
 
ventricular fibrillation has generated discussion regarding the safety of this technique 
(82
–
84)
. It 
is worth noting that these epi[INVESTIGATOR_481161] a catheter which was positioned in close proximity to a bleeding vessel as well as 
the thin alveolar
-
capi[INVESTIGATOR_481162]. It seems that the volume of diluents used has as much of a significant role on 
determining the magnitude of systemic absorption of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481163]. In one interesting canine st
udy, 1 mg of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481164] 10 mL of normal 
saline administered endotracheally, resulted in higher mean plasma epi[INVESTIGATOR_481165] 1 mL of saline 
(85)
. These results lend 
support to the theory maintaining that a more distal delivery of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481166] a larger volume of instillation likely resulting in carriage of more 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_481167].
 
Unfortunately, there is no study comparing 
different concentrations and/or volumes of installation for bronchoscopic administration of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_481168], let alone prophylactic use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481169]. It is possible that bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_481170]. However, as pulmonary 
organogenes
is occurs by [CONTACT_481256], proximal administration may vasoconstrict 
the vessels feeding the injured vasculature, thus decreasing flow and promoting hemostasis.

Patient Evaluation
 
Patients will undergo all study related procedures, including screening, informed consent, initial 
evaluation, and study intervention, during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481189]. 
 
 
Process of Obtaining Informed Consent
 
Informed Consent will be performed on the day of study recruitment. Eligible PROPHET Study 
patients will be discretely approached by [CONTACT_481263]’s language the aims, methods, potential benefits, and hazards ass
ociated with 
participation in the PROPHET trial. Details of the protocol will be discussed with the potential 
participant at the time of scheduling the bronchoscopy procedure, ensuring adequate time for 
consideration of the protocol (>24 hours from initial
 
discussion). These individuals will then be 
approached with the informed consent form. Whenever possible, the informed consent form will 
be given to the potential participants in advance. The risks, benefits, and alternative will be 
discussed so that the 
decision to participate in the study will be made independently by [CONTACT_481264]. Only a well
-
trained clinical coordinator, the principal investigator, or an associate 
investigator from the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in UMMC will obta
in 
consent. The consent will be obtained using and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved 
consent document. 
 
Any potential participants who cannot consent for themselves will be excluded from the study, 
as defined by [CONTACT_121566] (see above). This includes anyone who will be, or will have 
been, in a stressful, painful, or drugged condition before or dur
ing the consent process or 
otherwise lacks the mental capacity to consent for themselves. We will not obtain consent from 
Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs). We will not enroll minors.
 
Lung transplantation recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481190]

transplantation period. Hence, it is very likely that a patient who is eligible for participation in the 
[ADDRESS_618166] medical history and comorbid co
nditions, indication 
for lung transplant, indication for bronchoscopy with TBLB and possible concurrent procedure(s), 
prior complications related to bronchoscopy or TBLB, current and active medications, most 
recent pulmonary function tests, and most recent
 
report of echocardiogram will be reviewed to 
ensure inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. Recent laboratory data including complete blood 
count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and [ADDRESS_618167] 
intake vital signs obtained. Recent history and physical examinations dated within 30 days of 
procedure will be reviewed or obtained if not available. Participant
s will be monitored under 
telemetry starting with this intake period, during and approximately an hour after conclusion of 
procedure unless procedural complication merit additional closer monitoring. 
 
 
Monitoring Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study
 
Before and after the procedure, on the procedure day, study participants will be monitored in 
the 
UMMC endoscopy peri
-
procedure suite (for outpatients) or in the admitting unit (for 
inpatients). An on
-
call pulmonary physician will be available to assist with any immediate issues.
 
During the procedure, study participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_481265], the performing bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and any additional physicians participating in the 
procedure. We do not anticipate problems requiring withdrawal of pati
ents from the PROPHET 
study once enrolled, other than by [CONTACT_102]’s request. In the event a study subject elects to be 
withdrawn from the study and requests their data to be withdrawn as well, we will comply.
 
 
Study Drug and Placebo Preparation, Packaging, and Randomized Assignment
 
The dosing of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481191]. The 
UMMC does not have a formal policy regarding the prophylactic use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481192]. 
Treatment of airway bleeding with topi[INVESTIGATOR_481193], again, is based mainly on individual operator 
practice and institutional protocols. Dilution 
ratio ranges from 1:1,000 to 1:100,000 and volume 
of instillation ranges from 1 to 20 mL in different reports published across the medical literature 
(22,50
–
52)
. The only guidelines addressing this practice are the British Thoracic Society (BTS) 
guidelines on Diagnostic Flexible Bronchoscopy, which suggest using “small aliquots of 1:10,000 
diluted epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]” 
(49)
. 
 
[ADDRESS_618168] practice during a bronchoscopy 
for a cup of saline 
and a cup of 1:10,[ADDRESS_618169] practice and applies a two
-
step randomization process to ensure 
team blinding. 
 
On day of procedure, a diluted 1:10,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_481194] a member of 
the research team who will not be involved in the allocation of the study drug. To allow for the 
possibility that biopsies possibly will be performed from separate 
airways, two milliliters of 
1:10,000 concentration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_481195] 8 ml of ambient air will be drawn into a two 
syringes (“study drug”). Two separate syringes will be made with 2 ml of sterile saline and 8 ml 
of ambient air (“placebo”). The two s
ets of syringes will be labeled “A” or “B” based on an electric 
coin toss for randomization. A record of the coded syringes and their content will be documented 
in a unique database separate from the study database. In order not to breach blinding, lot 
num
bers for both Epi[INVESTIGATOR_481196]’s 
CRF without disclosing which letter was assigned to each aliquot.
 
As described below, the next step is for a second team member to randomly select one set of 
labeled syringes without the first study team member knowing which was selected, and then log 
the selection. As such, the team remains blinded and only when the two
 
logs are later merged 
will drug assignment be unblinded.
 
 
 
Study Group Randomized Assignment
 
To eliminate bias, two randomization and blinding processes will be employed: in preparing and 
labeling the sets syringes (as described above) and in choosing of the set of syringes at the time 
of the procedure. Those two separate processes will be perform
ed by [CONTACT_481266], each of them blinded to the results of the other procedure: 
 
 
1.
 
Two syringes will be prepared with the study drug (1:10,000 dilution of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) and 
two will be prepared with placebo (sterile saline). The syringes will be randomly labeled 
“A” and “B” based on a computerized electric coin toss and documented in a se
parate 
database as described above. This will be done by a member of the research team who 
will not be participating in the procedure and therefore blinded to the second 
randomization (syringe selection). 
 
2.
 
The syringes will be delivered to the procedure room prior to the procedure. At this time, 
the research team member who is responsible for the syringes will leave the room prior 
to the second randomization point. 
 
3.
 
The bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_481197]/her assistant who is blinded to the drug and placebo 
preparation process will randomly choose “A” or “B” based again on a computerized 
electric coin toss. 
 
4.
 
The chosen set of syringes will be recorded as part of the study database. 
 
[ADDRESS_618170] and 
any 
trainees assisting with the procedure. 
 
2.
 
In addition to informed consent for participation in the study protocol, a formal UMMC 
informed consent for the performance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoscopy
-
related 
procedures, and use of moderate sedatio
n will be obtained. 
 
3.
 
Per local protocol, peri
-
procedurally and during the procedure, the patient’s heart rate, 
electrocardiography rhythm strip, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oxygen saturation will be monitored 
continuously. Blood pressure will be repeatedly measured every 3 minutes. 
Up to 6 liters of 
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula will be given in order to maintain an oxygen saturation 
of >92%. A defibrillator as well as a resuscitation drugs and equipment are available at all 
times in the bronchoscopy suite. 
 
4.
 
Patient will undergo the procedure in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_481198]. 
Premedication will be performed per local protocol, including inhalation of 5 mL of 4% 
lidocaine via a nebulizer. Gurgling of 2 to 4 mL of 2% liquid lidocaine (20
-
40 mg) for up
per 
airway anesthesia may also be applied depending on the performing bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s 
preference. Moderate sedation will be achieved with a combination of midazolam (maximal 
dose of 6 mg per procedure) and fentanyl (maximal dose of 300 mcg per procedure).
 
Laryngeal and lower airway anesthesia during the procedure will be obtained with the use of 
2 mL aliquots of 2% liquid lidocaine up to a cumulative liquid lidocaine dose of 400 mg. A bite 
block will be used for procedures performed through the transoral a
pproach. For the 
transnasal approach, 2% viscous lidocaine will be applied with a cotton swab to the chosen 
nostril and nasal passage to allow easy advancement of the bronchoscope. 
 
5.
 
Bronchoscopy will be performed with an Olympus BF
-
1T160 or BF
-
1TH190 (Olympus, Tokyo, 
Japan) video bronchoscope under fluoroscopic guidance (OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C
-
arm, GE 
Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, [LOCATION_002]). 
 
6.
 
For the purpose of
 
independent post
-
procedure analysis, the entire procedure from insertion 
of the bronchoscope into the airways until its final retraction will be video
-
recorded on DVD 
media and individually labeled without disclosing study arm assignment. DVDs will be sto
red 
with other individual patient study documents for later review. Access to the stored DVDs will 
be provided only to the PROPHET study research team.
 
7.
 
Prior to biopsy performance 2 mL of 1:10,000 diluted epi[INVESTIGATOR_481199] 8 mL of 
ambient room air or 2 mL of sterile saline solution followed by 8 mL of ambient room air as 
described in “Study Drug and Placebo Preparation” will be instilled into the ta
rget airway by 
[CONTACT_447387][INVESTIGATOR_541]. This process may be repeated once, should the performing 
bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_481200] a different airway. If 
choose to do so, the same study drug will be instilled into both airways. A
ny additional 
biopsies performed, will be done without airway instillation of study drug.

Immediate Post
-
Procedure Surveillance
 
Following retraction of the bronchoscope, fluoroscopy will be performed while the patient is still 
on the bronchoscopy bed in order to try and identify early pneumothorax. The patient will then 
be transferred for recovery in the UMMC endoscopy peri
-
procedu
re suite or in the admitting 
unit. A chest radiograph will be obtained to identify late pneumothorax within two hours of the 
termination of the procedure or later if late symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax appear. Also, 
a repeat ECG will be obtained withi
n two hours of the termination of the procedure or earlier if 
symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia, ischemia, or conduction abnormality appear. The 
patient will also be assessed by a clinician to evaluate for signs and symptoms of pneumothorax 
or sign
ificant pulmonary hemorrhage on the same day of the procedure. Patients will be 
instructed not the drink or eat in the [ADDRESS_618178] pain. Symptomatic patients will be managed as deemed appropriate according to clinical 
judgment and the UMMC bronchoscopy suite guidelines. Management options include 
reassurance, prescription of appropriate medic
ation, referral to the primary care physician, 
referral to the lung transplantation clinic, or referral to a local or the UMMC emergency room.
 
Emergency situations may arise in which it is necessary to unmask treating physicians, emergency 
department personnel, clinic personnel, or the patient to the assigned treatment. Situations that 
require unmasking are expected to be rare. Since epi[INVESTIGATOR_481212] a short half
-
life it will probably 
be already eliminated from the study participant’s circulation by [CONTACT_481272] a 
provider for possible study drug
-
related side effect. It is possible, however, that emergency 
personnel or treating physici
ans might feel it is necessary to know the medication that participant 
was taking to decide upon a rational course of treatment, or to ensure that other medications 
are not given that might adversely interact with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. In such cases the treating me

100,000 patient visits involving TBLB and reported an overall
 
rate for procedure
-
related clinically 
significant hemorrhage of 0.58% 
(37)
. In a second large survey from Japan, Asano et al. reviewed 
over 100,000 procedures, among them 57,199 forceps biopsies, and recorded a bleeding rate of 
0.73% 
(38)
.  These low rates of bleeding likely reflect both insensitive thresholds to define 
bleeding as well as a lower risk population than that of lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
 
Bleeding risk in lung transplantation patients seems to be higher than that of the general 
population, although one must bear in mind the following caveats: (1) most of the currently 
published literature is retrospective and observational in nature; (2) lu
ng transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_481215]; and (3) in most studies to date, the definition 
of clinically
-
significant bleeding was based on the amount of bloody fluid collected in the suction 
container during the procedure. T
his quantification method is prone to much bias since this fluid 
is a mixture of blood, airway secretions, and lavage fluid, and thus may over

estimated the true 
volume of blood loss. Also, the volume of blood loss considered clinically relevant varies acr
oss 
published studies and affects to a great extent on the reported rate of clinically

significant 
bleeding. The most prominent lung transplant studies examining the prevalence of TBLB

related 
bleeding are summarized in the table below:

were compared with the Student’s t-test for normally distributed data with similar 
variance and the Mann-Whitney tests for non-normally distributed data. Proportions 
were compared using Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. Statistical 
significance was set at P<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed based on original

Potential Benefits
We 
hypothesize that prophylactic instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481216]-related hemorrhage, leading to lower rate of prematurely aborted procedure due to
bleeding complications and higher yield of intended biopsies. The participants may, therefore,
have 
direct 
benefit 
from 
participation 
if 
prophylactic 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_481217] a higher diagnostic yield.
No financial reimbursements or incentive for participating in the PROPHET study will be provided.
Potential Risks and Discomforts

of 
care 
and 
not 
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
research. 
Potential 
risks 
and
discomfort 
of 
the 
bronchoscopy 
and 
TBLB 
themselves 
are 
no 
more
than 
what 
the 
participant
would 
undergo 
as 
a 
part 
of 
their 
post-transplantation 
bronchoscopy. 
These 
risks 
include
hemorrhage 
related 
to 
the 
procedural 
maneuvers, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4783], 
pneumothorax 
(i.e.
collapsed lung). These complications are rare (less than <1% of all bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) and can be
expected in any bronchoscopy and TBLB. An experienced bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_102752] a well-trained staff

well 
trained 
to 
handle 
these 
potential 
complications

suite. 
Bronchoscopic 
procedures 
performed 
in 
the 
UMMC
bronchoscopy 
suite 
are 
usually 
performed 
under

more 
than 
what 
the

for 
their 
post-transplantation 
bronchoscopy. 
Conscious 
sedation 
is
generally safe, but can cause nausea and vomiting, ineffective ventilation resulting from airway

Adverse Events Reporting to the IRB 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study, including those observed by [CONTACT_107696], will be recorded. Serious unanticipated problems, defined as complications 
thought to be likely related to the study drug administration and requir
e some intervention, will 
be reported to the IRB as soon as possible but not more than [ADDRESS_618187] learns of the event. Not serious 
protocol deviations will only be reported to the IRB (within [ADDRESS_618188] 
learns of the deviation) if they represent a departure from UMMC policies for the conduct of 
human subject research, adversely affect the health care of subject(s), or compromise the 
interpretation or integrity of the research. Not 
serious protocol deviations that result from 
normal subject scheduling variations or technical issues associated with sampling that do not 
impact the health of the subject or interpretation of the study data will not be reported.
 
Adverse events that are clearly not related to the study procedures, such as those that occur 
prior to initiation of study
-
related procedures, will not be reported to the IRB. Adverse events 
that are expected and thought to be related to the natural histor
y of lung transplantation and its 
comorbidities will not be reported to the IRB.
 
Expected adverse events (sore throat, cough, mild hemoptysis, low
-
grade fever, non
-
life
-
threatening allergic reactions) that do not require intervention will not be reported to the IRB. 
All other adverse events will be reported in aggregate at the time of 
continuing review.
 
Deaths will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_618189]’s status will generate a report. The report will include subject 
identification, date of event, date the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32305], description of event, date 
the event resolved if applicable, type of harm if an
y experienced by [CONTACT_2299], relationship 
harm to the event and date the report was submitted to the IRB and other regulatory authorities.

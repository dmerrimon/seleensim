6 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
 1.1 
Study Design  
 This is a phase Ib, open label study assessing the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with T-DM1.  The population to be studied consists of patients with metastatic HER2 -positive (HER2+) breast cancer previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab.  The 
study will be conducted as a dose de-escalation study, as the common toxicities of the two agents are not overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is declared, 15 additional eligible patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will be entered into an expansion cohort.

BACKGROUND  
 2.1 
Study Disease : Metastatic HER2 -Positive Breast Cancer  
 HER2, also known as neu and c- erbB -2, is an oncogene encoding a tyrosine kinase growth factor 
receptor in the family of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR), and is amplified in approximately 20% of all human breast cancers.  It is an independent predictor of time to rela pse 
and overall survival in multivariable models, and is a marker of poor prognosis.
[ADDRESS_743616].
7-11  Further therapeutic approaches are 
therefore needed.  As described in more detail below, there is evidence that supports using the anti-tumor immune response as a therapeutic target in HER2+ breast cancer, especially 
concurrent with antibody- based therap y. 
 2.2 
Pembrolizumab  
  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_743617] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformatio n has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long- term 
survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD -[ADDRESS_743618] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD- 1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD- 1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of murine PD-1 has been 
resolved .  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T- cell stimulatio n, PD-[ADDRESS_743619] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and C D8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer 
cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double 
negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macr ophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD-1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are consti tutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors.  Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region 
and co ntain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_743620] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD- L1 ser ves to dampen unwarranted T-
cell fun ction in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD- L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T- cell inhibitor.  PD -1 
has been suggested to regulate tumor- specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma 
(MEL) .  This suggests that the PD-1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  Keytruda
TM (pembrolizumab; MK-3475) has recently been approved in the

.   
 Clinical data are derived from an ongoing, first -in-human phase I study (PN001, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy, sponsored by 
.  There are five parts to this study (Parts A-D and F) (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2014).  Part A was a 3+3 dose escalation study in subjects with so lid tumors to evaluate safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics, and to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or preliminary recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds).  Doses were 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W); doses of either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg were also administered every 3 weeks (Q3W).  All 3 dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) were observed; therefore, the MTD was not determined.  The RP2D was determined by [CONTACT_313838], PK, and pharmacodynamic measurements, along with the strength of antitumor activity signals observed.  Pharmacokinetics The half -life (t
1/2) of pembrolizumab is approximately 4 weeks and there is no indication of dose 
dependency or half-life in the three dose groups (1,3, and 10 mg/kg) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  The long t
1/2 supports a dosing interval of every 2 or 3 weeks. 
 There was a dose -related increase in exposure from 1 to 10 mg/kg.  Serum concentrations of 
pembrolizumab were lower by a factor o f approximately 5 in patients receiving 2 mg/kg Q3W 
than in those receiving 10 mg/kg Q3W.  Steady- state trough concentrations were 20% greater in 
the patients receiving 10 mg/kg Q2W than in those receiving the same dose Q3W.  A population pharmacokinetic a nalysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from [ADDRESS_743621] of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab  in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the 

NCI Protocol #:

10 dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optim ally consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients expos ure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well 
tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also redu ce complexity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Data 
The occurrence of ADA has been observed in less than 1% of the patients screened, indicating a low potential of pembrolizumab to elicit the f ormation of ADA.  No impact of ADA on 
pembrolizumab exposure has been observed.  Efficacy  
When treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, the overall response rate (ORR) for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (IPI) -treated patients with melanoma was 25%/27% according to the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/investigator -assessed immune -related response criteria 
(irRC), respectively (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  The ORR for IPI-naïve patients with melanoma was 39%/43% by [CONTACT_393]/investigator- assessed irRC, respe ctively.  The majority of 
responses were seen in patients with melanoma by 16 weeks of therapy; however, some responses have been reported after [ADDRESS_743622]- defin ed progression followed by 
[CONTACT_313839].  The preliminary ORR for 38 patients with non- small cell lung cancer was 21%/24% by 
[CONTACT_393]/investigator -assessed irRC, respectively (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). 
 Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) has suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).    PD-L1 is being investigated as a predictive biomarker for pembrolizumab treatment.  At the [ADDRESS_743623] 1.1 occurred in 4 out of 7 patients with higher levels of PD-
L1 expression (57%, 95% CI 18-90%) versus 2 out of 22 patients with lower levels of PD- L1 
expression (9%, 95% CI 1- 29%).  These data are extremely preliminarily, and PD -L1 is not 
being used for patient selection.  Biomarkers to evaluate immune modulation and markers in the tumor microenvironment, such as

11 T-cell infiltration, the baseline expression of markers of T-cell suppression FoxP3 or the 
immunoregulatory enzyme incoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor biopsies, were 
associated with a high response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.13,[ADDRESS_743624] frequent treatment -related adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, cough, pruritis, 
diarrhea, and rash (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  Most AEs were not considered serious.  The most commonly- reported immune -related AEs were rash, pruritis, vitiligo, hypothyroidism, 
arthralgia, diarrhea, and pneumonitis.  Important identified risks include: pneumonitis, thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), colitis, diarrhea, hepatitis, nephritis, uveitis, rash/pruritis, and neuropathy.   2.3 
T-DM1  
 
T-DM1 mechanism of action  
T-DM1 is a promising anti-HER2 agent, with proven efficacy in the metastatic setting.  T- DM1 
is composed of: trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to domain IV on the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 and inhibits tumor growth in 
vitro  and in vivo via several mechanisms ;
15-17 DM1, a potent anti-microtubule agent derived from 
maytansine; and SMCC, a thioether linker molecule used to conjugate DM1 to trastuzumab.  T-
DM1 retains all of the modes of action of trastuzumab, which include a binding affinity to the HER2 ECD that is comparable to trastuzumab, inhibition of HER2-ECD shedding, inhibition of the HER2 -activated PI3K/Akt signa ling pathway, and mediation of antibody- dependent cell -
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
18  Linkage of a cytotoxic agent to highly specific monoclonal 
antibodies targeting tumor -specific and/or overexpressed tumor- associated antigens focuses the 
delivery of such agents to tumor cells, which creates a more favorable therapeutic window than could be achieved by [CONTACT_566152], and may facilitate combinations with different agents.  After binding to HER2, T-DM1 undergoes receptor- mediated internalization, 
followed by [CONTACT_566153]1 and subsequent cytotoxicity.  Activation of cytotoxicity of the conjugate requires that it be internalized into the cell after binding to HER2.  The non-internalized conjugate remains inactive, thus limiting the systemic toxicity.  
 
T-DM1 clinical efficacy data  
In multiple clinical phase II and III studies, T-DM1 as a single agent has demonstrated robust and clinically meaningful activity, as well as favorable toxicity in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC).  Two phase II studies —TDM4258g and TDM4374g— evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of T -DM1 administered at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg (maximum tolerated dose 
[MTD] in Phase I) every 3 weeks until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity in 
HER2+ MBC who had progressed on previous HER2-directed therapy and conventional chemotherapy.

The clinical benefit rate (CBR) (defined as complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or

and 40.7% by [CONTACT_193384] (95% CI, 31.8%, 50.6%). The median progression- free 
survival (PFS) was 4.6 months by [CONTACT_566154] 
(IRF) assessment. In Study TDM4374g, on the basis of clinical data collected through [ADDRESS_743627] patient had enrolled, the ORR among all treated 
patients was 34.5% (95% CI, 26.1%, 43.9%) by [CONTACT_566155] 32.7% (95% CI, 24.1%, 42.1%) by [CONTACT_3138].  The CBR was 48.2% (95% CI, 38.8%, 57.9%) by [CONTACT_566156] a nd 46.4% (95% CI, 37.1%, 56.1%) by [CONTACT_3138].  The median 
duration of response was not reached (95% CI, 4.6 months, not reached) by [CONTACT_566155] 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.6 months, not reached) by [CONTACT_3138]. In this study population, there was a median PFS of 6.9 months (95% CI:   4.2, 9.5) as assessed by [CONTACT_566157] 
5.5 months (95% CI:   4.1, 7.5) by [CONTACT_107443]. 
 The safety profile of T -DM1 was also similar between the two studies.  In  Study TDM4258g, the 
five most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (65.2%), nausea (50.9%), headache 
(40.2%), epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (35.7%), and pyrexia (34.8%).  Most of these events were Grade 1− 2. The 
three most common Grade 3− 4 AEs observed in this trial were hypokalemia (8.9%), 
thrombocytopenia (TCP) (8.0%), and fatigue (4.5%).  In Study TDM4374g, a total of 49 patients (44.5%) experienced at least one Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_743628] common Grade ≥  3 adverse 
events (by [CONTACT_10607] [MedDRA] preferred terms) were TC P 
(7.3%), fatigue (4.5%), and cellulitis (3.6%).  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 25 
patients (22.7%). No single SAE was reported in more than 4 patients. No Grade ≥  3 left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) events (symptomatic congestive heart failure [CHF] 
and/or left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of < 40%) were reported in either study.  
 
In the randomized phase III EMILIA study, T-DM1 monotherapy proved superior to the approved regimen lapatinib/capecitabine in patients who had progressed on prior trastuzumab and taxane.
21  Median PFS was 9.6 months in the T-DM1 arm compared with 6.4 months in the 
capecitabine and lapatinib arm (HR = 0.65, 95% CI; 0.55 to 0.77; p <0.001), and median overall survival (OS) at the second interim analysis crossed the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_289842] (30.9 months vs. 25.1; HR = 0.68, 95% CI; 0.55 to 0.85; p <0.001). Overall, fewer Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were observed in the T -DM1 arm (40.8%) than in the lapatinib arm (57%). The most 
common Grade ≥  3 adverse events  with T -DM1  were thrombocytopenia (12.9%), elevated AST 
(4.3%) and ALT (2.9%), anemia (2.7%) and fatigue (2.4%).  Based on the EMILIA data, T- DM1 
was recently approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer that has progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy, with superior overall survival (OS) and a better adverse event profile compared to the lapatinib/capecitabine combination.

Rationale  
 Accumulating evidence suggests that the immune system plays an important role in control of HER2+ breast cancer, and works with HER2-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_566133].  High levels of immune infiltrates are observed in HER2 -overexpressing breast cancers.  Recent studies suggest that 
monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab may stim ulate adaptive anti -tumor immunity.  Two 
studies in mice demonstrated that anti-HER2 antibody therapy required adaptive CD8-dependent immunity to mediate its optimal effect.
22,23  It is thought that trastuzumab activates toll- like 
receptor signaling, priming the release of interferon (IFN) and priming IFN -producing CD8+ T 
cells.  In addition, more recent data suggested that each 10% increase in tumor- infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs ) was associated with a significant decrease in distant recurrence in patients 
receiving adjuvant trastuzumab,24 further suggesting the importance of antitumor immunity in 
the HER2+ subset of breast cancer.  In HER2+ breast cancer patients, therefore, combining cytotoxic chemotherapy (which provokes tumor antigen recognition) with anti- HER2 
monoclonal antibodies (which stimulate adaptive immunity) and checkpoint inhibitors (which enhance adaptive antitumor immune responses by [CONTACT_166187] T cell exhaustion) is an attractive, 
rational approach for maximizing the antitumor immune response to advance the treatment of 
HER2 -positive breast cancer.  
 Trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1), as described above, is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) 
composed of trastuzumab (a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular region of HER2), DM1 (an anti-microtubule cytotoxic agent), and a linker molecule.  Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor with promising clinical data in melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer, as 
discussed above, as well as preliminary efficacy data in triple negative breast cancer.
25  The 
combination of pembrolizumab with T- DM1 has the potential to concurrently: (1) stimulate 
tumor antigen recognition through use of a cytotoxic; (2) simulate adaptive immunity and ADCC through use of anti-HER2 antibody therapy; and (3) enhance the anti- tumor autoimmune 
response with an anti- PD-1 antibody.  The proposed study will explore the safety and efficacy of 
this combination in women with advanced HER2+ breast cancer.

the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a tumor specimen, commonly assessed simply by [CONTACT_313845] a standard hematoxylin and eosin- stained slide by a trained 
pathologist, is a significant predictor of both response to therapy and overall disease outcomes in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.

 In melanoma, the solid malignancy currently at the forefront of understanding the anti-tumor immune response, investigation into expression of immune mediators in the peripheral blood is at an early phase.
33  As a correlative study to this trial, we will characterize the immune marker 
profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in enrolled breast cancer patients.  Additiona lly, given the demonstrated clinical significance of TILs in breast cancer specimens, 
we will investigate whether there is a peripheral marker whose level corresponds to TIL percentage.  Lastly, we will evaluate whether there is a correlation between chang es in PBMC 
immune profiles over the course of treatment, and disease response to therapy.  Evidence of a correlation would be of significant interest as it would suggest the potential presence of a predictive biomarker in the peripheral blood.   2.5.[ADDRESS_743633]’s immune defenses, which must balance immune tolerance of beneficial microbes with inflammatory responses against pathogens.

TREATMENT PLAN  
  5.1 
Treatment Regimen  
The study will be conducted as a dose de- escalation study, as the common toxicities of the two 
agents are not overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Each cycle will be 21 days in length.  Six patients will be entered at dose level 1 (Table 1), consisting of T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg IV every 21 days, in combination with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 21 days.  If one or fewer dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are noted within the first six patients, this dose level will be declared the RP2D.  If two or more DLTs are found in the first 6 patients, then 6 additional patients will be entered at dose level -1 (Table 1).  If one or fewer DLTs are noted at dose level -1, then this will be declared the RP2D.  If two or more DLTs are noted at dose level -1, enrollment will be stopped.  No dose changes will be explored for pembrolizumab as it s toxicity  has not been found to be dose-dependent in 
other clinical contexts.  
 The DLT period is defined as [ADDRESS_743650] dose of therapy (i.e. the first cycle of 
therapy ).  All six patients enrolled to the dose level must complete the DLT period before 
additional patients can be enrolled.  Once the RP2D is declared, 15 eligible patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will be entered into an expansion cohort.  Treatment will be administered on an outpati ent basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.1.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  Details of the regimen are described in Table 2.  No investigational or commercial agents other than those de scribed below may be administered with the intent to treat the participant’s 
malignancy.

• Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4579]-existing medical conditions unless listed as prohibited therapy 
below. Any medication intended solely for supportive care (e.g., analgesics, anti-diarrheal, anti-depressants) may be used at the investigator’s discretion. Patients on anti-coagulant treatment should have their platelet count monitored closely during treatment with T -DM1. Anti emetics and anti -diarrheal medications should not be administered 
prophylactically before initial treatment with study drugs.  At the discretion of the investigator, prophylactic antiemetic and anti- diarrheal medication(s) may be used as per 
standard clinical practice before subsequent doses of study drugs. 
• Hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating 
factor) may be used at investigator’s discretion for the primary prophylaxis and/or 
management of treatment -emergent n eutropenia and/or for secondary prophylaxis as per 
NCCN/European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines

However, treatment with granulocyte- colony stimulating factors will not permitted in 
cycle 1 unless the patient has febrile neutropenia and the physician considers its use as clinically indicated. It will be left to the treating physician choice from cycle 2.  
• Bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy to be used in accordance with the approved labeled indication and/or nationally recog nized treatment guidelines.  Participants already 
receiving bisphosphonate/denosumab at the time of study entry can continue the treatment. Participants with new bone metastases documented as part of study screening procedures may begin a bisphosphonate af ter study registration but before initiation of 
protocol therapy. 
• Anticoagulants - Anticoagulation with heparin, heparin derivatives, and/or warfarin may be given at the discretion of the treating physician. Coagulation parameters should be checked at leas t once monthly, or more frequently at discretion of treating physician.  
• Pain medications administered per standard clinical practice are acceptable while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
 
Patients who experience toxicities should be treated symptomatically as clinically indicated.  Medications that are considered necessary for the subject’s welfare and that are not expected to 
interfere with the evaluation of study treatment or be restricted  may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator.   Ancillary treatments will be given as medically indicated.

ion of Progressive Disease 
 Pembrolizumab, like other immunotherapeutic agents, may produce antitumor effects b y 
potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immune responses. The r espons e patterns seen with 
such an approach may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_566137], and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden 
or even the appearance of new lesions.  
 For any  subject who showed first radiologic evidence of progressive disease (PD) by [CONTACT_393] 
1.1 (see Section 11.1.4) and is deemed  clinically stable, it is at the discretion of the investigator 
to continue treating the subject until progression is confirmed at least [ADDRESS_743673] will continue treatment and radiographic scans. Any

 For purposes of PFS assessment on this trial, in addition to radiographic assessment of tumor response or progression, the investigator should taking into account the clinical condition/stability of subjects.  
 Clinically stable is defined by [CONTACT_4868]: 
o Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of labor atory values) 
indicating  disease progression  
o No decline in ECOG performance status 
o Absence of rapid progression of disease 
o Absence of progressive tumor(s) at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention  
 Any subject who showed first radiologic evidence of progressive disease and is deemed Clinically unstable should be discontinued from both study drugs and is not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation.  
 For a clinically stable subject with fir st radiologic evidence of progressive disease 
(ie,unconfirmed progression of disease), it is at the discretion of the investigator to continue treating the subject with the assigned treatment per protocol until progression of disease is  
confirmed on a subs equent scan at least [ADDRESS_743675] will be discontinued from  study treatment. Exceptions may be considered to continue treatment in the presence of

manifesting as elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin; and (2) pneumonitis.  Dose modifications for these toxicities are addressed separately in Section 6.3.  
 For toxicities likely attributable to pembrolizumab alone, concurrent holding of T- DM1  is at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
 Adverse events (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or several months af ter the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug-related  
toxicities  and severe or life- threatening AEs as per Table 4 below.

Adverse Event List for Pembrolizumab  
 
In the pembrolizumab monotherapy trials (P001/P002, P012, P013, and P028, plus the P011 monotherapy arm), the overall incidence of AEs ranged from 83.0% (73 of 88 subjects in P012) to 100% (10 of 10 subjects in P011). The most commonly reported AEs included fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, and anemia. The incidence of drug –related AEs (DRAEs) 
ranged from 39.8% (35 of 88 subjects in P013) to 80.0% (8 of 10 subjects in P011). The most commonly reported DRAEs across all studies were nausea, fati gue, and diarrhea. The incidence 
of Grade 3 -5 DRAEs across studies ranged from 6.8% (6 of 88 in P013) to 12.0% (187 of 1562

43 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event List (s) for T-DM1  
 
Identified and potential risks of treatment with T- DM1 are based on all available nonclinical 
and clinical data relating to T -DM1 as well as clinical toxicities related to its components 
(trastuzumab and maytansine), in addition to other DM1- containing ADC s.   
 Pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiac toxicity (left ventricular dysfunction), infusion -
related reaction/hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia (including thrombocytopenia associated with severe hemorrhage), and peripheral neuropathy are important identified risks with T -DM1 
and are detailed in the subsections below.  Fetal harm and impaired fertility are important potential risks with T -DM1. Guidance on dose modifications are provided in Section 6. 
 Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a  full description of the T- DM1 safety profile, 
warnings, precautions, and guidance.  
 Pulmonary Toxicity Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, some leading to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_566138], have been reporte d in clinical trials with T -
DM1.  Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary infiltrates.  These events may or may not occur as sequelae of infusion reactions.  Patients with dyspnea at rest as 
a result of complications of advanced m alignancy and/or comorbidities may be at increased risk 
of pulmonary events.  Treatment has included administration of steroids and oxygen, as well as 
study drug discontinuation.   Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity, predominantly in the form of asymptomatic increases in the concentrations of 
serum transaminases (Grade 1 −4 transaminitis), has been observed in patients treated  with T -
DM1.  Transaminase elevations were generally transient with peak elevation at Day [ADDRESS_743683] of T-DM1 on transaminases has been observed:  the proportion of patients with Grade 1 or 2 
elevated transam inases increases with successive cycles; however, no increase in the proportion 
of Grade [ADDRESS_743684] dose of T- DM1.  
 Rare cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including death due to drug -induced liver injury (DILI) and 
associated hepatic encephalopathy, have been observed in patients treated with T -DM1.  While 
there is evidence of drug induced liver toxicity in patients treated with T -DM1, its potential to 
cause acute severe liver injury with clinically meaningful changes in liver function is unclear, as the observed cases may have been confounded by [CONTACT_566160]/or underlying conditions.  A contributory role of T -DM1 in these 
cases cannot be excluded  so acute severe liver injury (Hy’s law) remains an important potential 
risk with T- DM1.  A Hy’s law case has the following components:  
 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
44 1. Aminotransferase enzymes are greater than 3  × ULN with concurrent 
elevation of serum TBILI to  > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of 
cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase).  
2. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased 
aminotransferases and serum TBILI, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; 
preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
3. Gross jaundice, clinical disability, or the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566139] -induced (by T -DM1).  
 
Cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver have been identified from liver 
biopsies in patients treated with T -DM1 and presenting with signs and symptoms of portal 
hypertension.  NRH is a rare liver condition characterized by [CONTACT_566161]; NRH may lead to non -cirrhotic portal 
hypertension and also may be fatal.
36  NRH  should be considered in patients who develop 
clinical symptoms of portal hypertension and/or a cirrhosis -like pattern seen on CT scan of the 
liver but with normal transaminases and no other manifestations of cirrhosis or liver failure following long- term treatment with T -DM1.  Diagnosis of NRH can only be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_26745].  
 Cardiac Toxicity  
Patients treated with T -DM1 are at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_566140].  
LVEF  < 40% has been observed in patients treated with T -DM1.   
 Infusion- Related Reactions  (IRRs)/Hypersensitivity  
Infusion -related reactions (anaphylactoid/cytokine release reactions) and hypersensitivity 
(anaphylactic/allergic reactions) may occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been repor ted with T -DM1.  Treatment with T-DM1 has not been studied in patients 
who had trastuzumab permanently discontinued due to an IRR/hypersensitivity; treatment with T-DM1 is not recommended for these patients.   
 Infusion -related reactions (IRRs), characteri zed by [CONTACT_91842]-
flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia- have 
been reported in clinical trials of T -DM1.  In general, these symptoms were not severe.  In most 
patients, these reac tions resolved over the course of several hours to a day after the infusion was 
terminated.  Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic -like reactions) has been observed in clinical 
trials of T -DM1.   
 Patients will be observed closely for infusion related/hyp ersensitivity reactions during and after 
each T -DM1 infusion as detailed in Section 5.3.2.  Pre -medication is allowed according to

Formulation , Preparation, and Storage  
 
Trastuzumab -MCC -DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine, T -DM1) is provided as a single -use 
lyophilized formulation in a colorless 20- mL Type I glass vial closed by [CONTACT_3553] a 
FluroTec- coated stopper and an overseal with flip- off cap.  Upon receipt of T -DM1 vials 
should be refrigerated at 2°C –8°C. All vials of T -DM1 should be handled by [CONTACT_566164] s taff wearing gloves and visually inspected upon receipt to ensure they are 
intact without exterior contamination. Drug from any vials that appear abnormal upon inspection should not be administered to patients.  The lyophilized product should be reconstituted using Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI).  Using a new syringe, 8mL SWFI should be added to the vial and the vial swirled gently until the product is completely dissolved. The vial should not be shaken.  The resulting product contains 20 mg/mL T -DM1, 10 mM sodium succinate, pH 5.0, 60 mg/mL sucrose, 
and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20. Each [ADDRESS_743697] is a clear colorless solution, and is free of particulates before proceeding.  Drug from any vial that appears abnormal upon inspection should not be administered to patients.  Using a new syringe, the in dicated volume of T -DM1 solution should be removed from the 
vial(s) and added to the IV bag containing at least 250 mL of 0.45% sodium chloride (preferred) or 0.9% sodium chloride injection and gently inverted to mix the solution.  A 0.22 micron non-protei n adsorptive polyethersulfone (PES) in- line filter is recommended 
when using 0.45% sodium chloride and required when using 0.9% sodium chloride injection.  The solution of T-DM1 should not be shaken.   The solution of T -DM1 for infusion should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, 
storage times should not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C−8°C (36°F−46°F) for solutions of

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 All patients will be asked to provide archival tumor tissue (either paraffin blocks or 15 unstained slides , ideally 4 micron thickness).  However, if archival tissue is not available or not evaluable, 
that will not be a basis to exclude the patient from any portion of the trial or the planned analysis.  Archival tissue will be used for immune profiling assays to ascertain baseline values in patients who choose not to undergo baseline research fresh tissue biopsy (in the dose de- escalation 
cohort) or in whom there is insufficient tissue or failed testing  of any of the planned assays from 
baseline fresh tissue biopsy.  A baseline research biopsy prior to study therapy is required in the expansion cohort of this trial, and optional in the dose de-escalation cohort.  We plan to use baseline biopsy tissue to perform a number of immune profiling assays. On baseline tumor biopsies, we will perform characterization based on histology (TILs), protein expression, and mRNA expression.    An optional research  biopsy after [ADDRESS_743700] biopsy accessible tumor.  These biopsies will undergo the same characterization testing as described for baseline biopsies .  
 Serial  blood draws for correlative science are required on this trial; blood draws will be obtained 
every 3 weeks on treatment days, prior to the infusion of study drugs, at the end-of- treatment 
visit in patients who go off study for progressive dis ease, and all efforts will be made to obtain a 
sample  at the time of progressive disease from participants who went off study for anything other 
than progressive disease.  We will perform  flow cytometry on these samples to characterize 
protein expression of immune mediators .  Circulating free DNA will be assessed as well.    
 If participants agree, a portion of these specimens will be banked for possible future genomic 
analysis, and other further testing.  All patients will additionally be asked to provide a  stool sample at three separate timepoints: 
prior to treatment, during treatment, and at the time of disease progression. A fourth collection may be requested from patients who experience grade ≥ 2 diarrhea after discussion with the PI. This collection is not required, but is strongly encouraged. These samples will be analyzed for 
microbiota content. Please refer to the separate laboratory manual for stool details including specific collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].

Hypotheses for correlative objectives  
 
• We hypothesize that all breast tumors can be placed in a baseline category of general “immune activity” level based on histologic, protein- based, and genomic analyses.  
• We hypothesize that breast tumors with a higher level of “immune activity” at baseline, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_566166], will have a higher likelihood of responding to 
treatment with T -DM1 plus pembrolizumab. 
• We hypothesize that tumors with a more significant change in “immune activity” over the course of [ADDRESS_743703] a higher likelihood of benefitting from the treatment.  
• We hypothesize that the immune marker profile in the peripheral blood will change over the course of T-DM1 plus pembrolizumab therapy. 
• We hypothesize that a larger increase in markers of immune activity in the peripheral blood will correlate with a better disease response as assessed on concurrent restaging scans  and in terms of best radiographic response at any time on trial. 
• We hypothesize that an immune marker or composite of markers in the peripheral blood at baseline will correspond to TIL percentage in baseline tumor biopsies. 
• We hypothesize that the structure and function of the gut microbiome differs among patients with breast cancer.  
• We hypothesize that the structure and function of the gut microbiome before starting 
pembrolizumab and T- DM1  can be predictive of efficacy of this therapy, with a greater 
microbial diversity, estimated by [CONTACT_313856], being predictive of efficacy. 
• We hypothesize that the structure and function of gut microbiome changes in response 
pembrolizumab-based therapy and can predict the likelihood of response to pembrolizumab plus T- DM1 . 
• We hypothesize that the abundance and functional profile of specific gut bacteria is associated with response to pembrolizumab plus T- DM1 .

 9.6.2 
Immunohistochemistry  
 Tissue will be collected and fixed by 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded.  Four micrometer-thick sections will be cut.  The paraffin blocks and unstained slides will be stored at room temperature.  All immunohistochemical staining will be performed in the Center for Immuno-Oncology Pathology Core at Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer 
Center (DF/HCC) Specialized Histopathology Core.   Formalin fixed -paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor slides will be prepared and H&E stained for 
assessment of TIL in pre- and post- treatment tumor samples.  To identify subsets of different 
immune populations (effector/memory CD8 cells, T regulatory cells, dendritic cells, tumor associated macrophages, and Tie- 2 expressing m onocytes (TEM)), immunohistochemical (IHC) 
staining will be performed on FFPE tumor slices using some or all of the following antibodies: Core set: CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, PD- L2 
Others: CD3, CD4, CD25, FoxP3, Indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase-1 (IDO1), CD11c, CD83, CD86, CD56, CD14, CD16, Tie2 (See also Appendix E) 
 Chen et al
37 describe a semi -quantitative scoring method, which is in accordance with typi[INVESTIGATOR_566142].  Briefly, staining is scored according to intensity (0= no staining, 1=weak staining, 2=moderate staining, 3=strong staining), staining 
patter (M=predominantly cell membrane; C=predominantly cell cytoplasm), and the percentage of cells showing positive staining (0 -100%).  The semi-quantitative scoring is performed for: 1) 
the neoplastic tumor cells and 2) the non- neoplastic infiltrating immune cells.  Significant 
discordant results have been rare during case evaluations.

Flow cytometry, genomic analysis  of biopsy stissue  
 TILs will be isolated from the biopsy specimen and assessed by [CONTACT_566167].   Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression  within tumor biopsy specimens will be assessed using the 
most current and informative methodologies at the time that correlative science is performed on all specimens.  NanoString signatures and comprehensive RNA sequencing may be used.  Potential genes of interest, based on prior immune profiling of breast tumors,
27 include CXCL9, 
CCL5, CD8ACD80, CXCL13, IGKC, CD21, IDO1, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, and FOXP3.  Additional DNA analysis, for example to assess mutation al load and neoantigen burden, may 
also be performed.

Analysis of PBMCs  
 PBMCs will be and used to assess immune cell populations by [CONTACT_4133].   9.6.5 
Analysis of cell -free DNA  
 Blood will be collected at baseline, restaging visits and at time of progression for evaluation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA).  The cfDNA will be banked in the DF/HCC Clinical Trials Core 
laboratory for future research purposes.  The banked samples will be used to analyze DNA, RNA and protein in future studies.   9.6.6 
Analysis of DNA extraction from stool samples  
 Microbial DNA is extracted using the Mag -Bind Universal Pathogen DNA Kit (Omega Bio -
Tek). Briefly, 250 mg of the specimen is transferred to a deep- well pla te for bead beating 
followed by [CONTACT_313859][INVESTIGATOR_313810]’s instructions. Finally, DNA is eluted in 100 uls of Elution Buffer and stored at -80°C until further use. 16S sequencing libraries are generated by [CONTACT_313860] v3 -v4 hypervariable regions of the 16S 
gene in a polymerase chain reaction using primers F341and R785. Resulting amplicons are tagged with unique molecular barcodes that are later used to demultiplex sequencing reads into individual sample buckets. Libraries are loaded on a MiSeq flowcell and sequenced following Illumina’s loading instructions. Sequence data are retrieved from the instrument by [CONTACT_313861].  
 
MicrobiomeDX uses BacPro™, a proprietary algorithm, to inspect and validate sequencing files by [CONTACT_313862], trimming, merging, and quality filtering steps. Paired sequencing reads are merged using an overlap of [ADDRESS_743707] the SILVA database at 99% sequence identity to obtain accurate taxonomic classifications and relative abundances. In parallel, feature tables are constructed to derive alpha

MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, participants with measurable disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_48928].  For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated every [ADDRESS_743719] – Solid Tumors  
 For the purposes of this study, participants  should be re- evaluated for response every [ADDRESS_743720] 24 weeks and then every 9 weeks until progression.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 weeks (+/- 7 days)  following initial documentation 
of objective response. In all participants, the date of progression will be documented as the first 

NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
65 date progression was observed. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international c riteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
    
11.1.[ADDRESS_743721] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
(Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Participants  who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_743722] one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_743723] x-ray or ≥[ADDRESS_743724] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Note : Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_743725] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
66 non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thou ght to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesion s. 
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesi ons will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumo r regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease)  including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3 Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followe d cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diame ter as 
assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[INVESTIGATOR_182556] #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_743726] x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; h owever, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical s pecifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
FDG -PET. While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseli ne, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. (b)  No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the  positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow- up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical 
literature for th e indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake

DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_743727] (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably  with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine) .The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably beginning the day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days total).  For infants and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient, for adolescents 2 drops 
t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d. Participants  and/or parents are asked about exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line i s 
established. The dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 seconds.  
Images from the head to the distal lower extremities should be obtained.  
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar: Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower 
extremities are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours following injection of 10 mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150 μCi/kg, maximum 10 mCi). Anterior views of the distal lower extremities are adequate. A large field of view dual head gamma camera with low energy collimators is preferred.  
 SPECT: Most participants  receiving I -[ADDRESS_743728]/CT may be performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later data and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new les ions are identified by [CONTACT_566169] #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_743729] in selected instances.   
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of thes e techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or s urgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cann ot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_743730] -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to different iate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on s tudy (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on

70 study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be  considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of New Lesion s 
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response reco rded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation ).

Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first da te that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events 
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. 
 
Progression-Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation. 
 
Time to Progression: Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored a t date of last disease 
evaluation for those without progression reported.

below, in addition to response or progression via tumor imaging.  Clinically stable is defined by [CONTACT_4868]: 
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically  significant progression of disease, 
including worsening of laboratory values. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression)

In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased, decreased or stayed stable, site investigators should consider all target lesions a well as non -target lesions.  
 Any subject deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from trial treatment at first 
evidence of progressive disease by [CONTACT_566170].  
 For a clinically stable subject with first radiologic evidence of progressive disease (i.e.  
unconfirmed progression of disease), it is at the discretion of the site investigator to continue treating the subject with the assigned treatment per protocol until progression of disease is confirmed at least [ADDRESS_743735] tumor imaging preformed per protocol, or sooner if clincially

apart demonstrating progressive disease) is clinically stable or clinically improved, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the confirmatory scan, an exception may be considered to continue treatment upon consultation with the principal investigator.  
 The same imaging modality (i.e., CT or MRI), acquisition and technical parameters should be used throughout the study for a given subject.  [IP_ADDRESS] 
Immune -Related Best Overall Response Using irRECIST (irBOR)  
 
irBOR is the best confirmed overall response over the study as a whole, recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumor assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual subject in the study.  For the as sessment of irBOR, all available assessments per subject 
are considered.  
 irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR assessment must be confirmed by a

(PBMCs) from baseline (pre -trial therapy) to on-treatment assessments  
• To explore whether induction of changes in the immunosuppressive and/or immune-
stimulating immune marker profile in PBMCs between baseline and on-treatment 
assessments correlates with disease response to therapy (response assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_743745] ) 
o In terms of response as assessed on serial scans  
o In terms of best response achieved at any time on trial 
• To investigate whether there is an immune marker in circulating PBMCs that corresponds 
to tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage in baseline tumor 
• In the cohort of patients who have re-biopsy at week 6 of treatment:  To characterize 
changes in a broad array of immune markers from baseline (as characterized above ) to 6

Sample size for this trial will depend on the outcome of the dose de-escalation phase. Six to 12 patients will be enrolled in the dose de-escalation phase, and once RP2D is determined, 15 more patients will be  enrolled in an expansion cohort. The operating characteristics of the dose de-
escalation portion of this study are shown below, which provides the probability of declaring the RP2D for a range of underlying true DLT rates. For example, for a toxicity that  occurs in 60% of 
patients, there is less than 5% probability (0.04) of declaring the RP2D.    
True underlying DLT rate  10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 
Probability of declaring RP2D  89% 66% 42% 23% 11% 4% 1% 0.2%  <0.01%  
 With 6 patients treated at the RP2D during dose de-escalation, and 15 patients in the dose expansion cohort (n = 21), the probability of observing at least one serious toxicity event is 89% if the true toxicity rate is 10%, and 66% if the true toxicity rate is 5%.  
 Objective response rate will be estimated among 15 patients in the expansion cohort and patients with measurable disease at screening who were treated at RP2D in the dose de- escalation phase.  
A total of 15 to 21 patients will be evaluable for ORR.  The table below gives the 95% CI (calculated using the exact binomial method) for the ORR estimate in a cohort size of 15 patients, given various true underlying ORR.  For example, if the true underlying response rate is 40% among 15 patients, the 95% CI would be 19-64%.   
True underlying ORR  20% 27% 33% 40% 47% 53% 
95% CI (n=15)  4-48% 8-55% 12-62% 16-68% 21-73% 27-79% 
 We estimate accrual to be 2 per month, and estimate accrual will take 12 -18 months to complete.

Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 The determination of the RP2D under the dose de- escalation scheme is defined in Section 13.1.  
Treatment -related toxicities will be summarized by [CONTACT_566172] 
v4.0 and reported with 90% binomial exact confidence intervals.   13.6

immune -related response (irCR + irPR) will be reported with 95% exact confidence intervals.   
 PFS will be describ ed using the method of Kaplan-Meier, and it will be presented with a 95% 
confidence interval. PFS is defined as the time from study registration to radiographic evidence of disease progression (as defined in Section 5.6) or death due to any cause, whicheve r occurred 
first. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation.  
 Correlative objectives will be descriptive -only, using summary statistics (such as mean, sd, 
median, IQR and range) to give the empi[INVESTIGATOR_566144]. With 15 patients evaluable for immune markers and under a Gaussian assumption to a continuous measure, a 95% confidence interval around a mean will have a width of approximately one standardized unit.   Correlation to responses will be reported as odds- ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals.  Specifically, as an example, we plan to measure PD -L1 
expression by [CONTACT_566173] a continuous variable, and correlate baseline PD -L1 expression and change in PD-L1 expression with response (by [CONTACT_566174]) as an exploratory analysis.  All analysis of Oncopanel in correlation with patient 
outcomes are exploratory and hypothesis- generating. Any promising findings will be exp lored in 
future studies.     13.[ADDRESS_743748] one dose of study medication  at the RP2D will 
be assessed for PFS, and the subset of patients with measurable disease will be assessed for objective response.

90 APPENDIX D  GUIDELINES FOR LIVER BIOPSY  
 
As nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) can be a very subtle diagnosis to make on liver biopsy, every attempt should be made to maximize the amount of tissue obtained. A minimum size of  an 
[ADDRESS_743758] 1.5 cm in length are recommended, if clinically appropriate. In order to diagnose NRH, reticulin and trichrome stains are necessary. Smaller biopsies obtained via a transjugular approach, as well as  smaller biopsy gun needle 
biopsies, are discouraged. Small wedge biopsies are also  discouraged. 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_743759] institutional procedures. The amount of tissue collected may follow the guidelines listed below.  Skin/chest wall: A goal of 2 5-mm punch biopsies will be obtained.  Lymph node: A goal of 5-7 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18- gauge needle.  
 Liver: A goal of 5-7 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18-gauge needle.  Lung: Because of the risk of pneumothorax associated with core needle biopsies of lung nodules, no core biopsies of lung nodules are mandated on this protocol, unless they are clinically indicated.  
Bone: Because the yield of malignant tissue from bone biopsies tends to be relatively low, if a patient has another accessible site of disease (i.e. skin, lymph node, liver), that site should be biopsied preferentially. If bone is the only biopsy- accessible site, then a goal of [ADDRESS_743760] judgment of the physician performing the procedure, are allowed per protocol.  If a patient is undergoing resection of a lesion for clinical reasons (i.e. wedge resection of a new lung lesion for confirmation of diagnosis or re-testing of hormone receptor or HER2 status; or, a resection of a chest wall lesion; or, resection of  a lymph node), then the patient may opt to have a portion of that tissue (roughly equivalent to the goal amount of tissue listed in the guidelines above, i.e. the equivalent of two 5-mm punch biopsies of the skin, or 4-6 18- gauge 
core biopsies) stored for research at the time of the procedure (provided that the tissue is processed as specified), in which case, the patient would not be required to undergo a separate research biopsy at baseline on this protocol.

Dear Research Participant:  
 
You are receiving this letter because you participated in the research study called, “A phase I cancer  
Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination with Trastuzumab -DM1 in Metastatic HER2 -Positive Breast 
Cancer,” and we would like to share some recent changes with you.   
  WHAT HAS HAPPENED?  
 The overall study plan has not changed , however the consent form  for th is study  has recen tly been 
updated to reflect  changes in the regulations regarding the way that  biological specimens  (blood, tissue, 
and stool  (which were  collected for research purposes) ) and data may be  handled. These changes are as 
follows:     
1. Biobanking —biological specimens previously collected from you may be shared with an 
outside lab or collaborator  and will be banked for future research.  
 Biological specimens (such as blood, tissue, bodily fluids, other specimens collected as a part of the study, and any materials that may be derived from these) will be collected and shared with an outside lab or collaborator for analysis. The specimens will not be identifiable. The specimens will be banked for future use.  
 As a part of this study, you previously a greed to provide researchers with a sample of your 
tumor tissue from a prior biopsy, surgery, or procedure. There is a risk associated with submitting this type of tissue for research studies and biobanking. Generally, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_566151] a prior biopsy, surgery, or procedure. This tissue may be used to help 
treat your cancer in the future. There is a small risk that when the tissue sample is submitted to the study or the biobank that your tissue could be used up.    
2. Data Collection —Your data may be shared with an outside collaborator or stored for future 
use.  
 Data will be collected and shared with an outside collaborator for analysis. The data will not be identifiable. The data will be banked for future use.  
  
3. Future use of data and specimens —Your de -identifiable data and/or biospecimens which 
were previously collected during this study may be stored and used for future research.

Your personal information and/or biospecimens collected during this study may be stored and used f or future research.  If so, any personal identifiers will be removed so that the information 
or samples cannot be linked back to you. As a result, we will no longer be able to identify and 
destroy them.  
 
Investigators, including investigators from collaborating institutions, can request this data and samples for new research.  Samples and data may also be shared with outside non -profit 
academic investigators as well as with for- profit pharmaceutical investigators or commercial 
entities, with whom we collabo rate.  
 You will not be asked to provide additional informed consent for the use of your de -identified 
information or samples in future research.  
 
Future research studies may include genetic research.  Your genes are unique to you.  At this 
time, you canno t be identified through this research.  There is a risk that you might be 
reidentified in the future as genetic research progresses.

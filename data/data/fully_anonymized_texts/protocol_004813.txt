BACKGROUND & PROJECT SUMMARY  
Electronic cigarettes (e- cigarettes) have a potential role in smoking cessation and harm 
reduction for tobacco cigarette smokers. As of 2019, the most popular e- cigarette is JUUL, a 
pod type device containing e- liquids with high nicotine content. The goal of this study is to 
better understand the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics responses produced by [CONTACT_143529] e- cigarette, compared to tobacco cigarettes, in e- cigarette and tobacco cigarette 
smokers.  

JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -[ZIP_CODE]   
2 RESEARCH AIMS  
2.1 SPECIFIC AIM  #1 
To categorize the nicotine PK profile (maximum plasma concentration; time to 
maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration- time curve) and 
compare when using the JUUL e- cigarette vs. a tobacco cigarette in a standardized 
manner.  
2.2 SPECIFIC AIM  #2 
To categorize the nicotine PK profile (maximum plasma concentration; time to 
maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration- time curve) and 
compare when using the JUUL e- cigarette vs a tobacco cigarette when using the product 
ad libitum.  
2.3 SPECIFIC AI M #3 
To evaluate various outcomes following JUUL e- cigarette or tobacco cigarette use, both 
with standardized and ad lib use including: heart rate, plasma catecholamines, pulmonary function testing.  
2.4 SPECIFIC AIM  #[ADDRESS_163261] of smoking tobacco cigarettes or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_143514]. Participants will recruited in two groups: primary e- cigarette 
vapers and primary cigarette smokers. The order of assignment to either tobacco cigarettes or the JUUL electronic cigarette will be counter -balanced via a latin square 
design.  
3.2 ENROLLMENT  TARGET  
We will enroll a total of 30 participants, across two groups; [ADDRESS_163262] occasionally used electronic cigarettes and 15 experienced electronic cigarette users who occasionally smoke tobacco cigarettes. We will seek to enroll equal numbers in each group, but will remain flexible during recruitment.  
3.3 STUDY  TIMELINE

6.2 SCREENING  VISIT  
The schedule of procedures for the screening visit will occur across two visits. One

The following will occur prior or during the remote visit : 
6.2.[ADDRESS_163273].  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# [ADDRESS_163274] Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. The personal data form and medical history will not be entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system, but remain source documents.  
Personal Data Form [paper source]  
o This section contains the participant’s contact [CONTACT_143531].  
Medical History [paper source]  
o This section contains information regarding the participant’s medical history, including exclusionary medical and psychiatric  conditions.  
o If any symptoms are endorsed on the Medical History in Section 8,  the 
CRC will follow up with the participant asking:  
 How often and when was  the last time you experienced these 
symptoms?  
 Do you ever take medication for this? If so, how  often?  
o Notes on the Medical History follow -up will be recorded at the bottom 
of the last page of the form to be reviewed by [CONTACT_2362].  
Demographics [direct  EDC , sent 24 hrs before online screening visit] 
o This section contains information regarding the participant’s gender, age, ethnicity, race, and  education 
Use/History/Dependence [direct EDC , sent 24 hrs before online screening 
visit]  
o This section contains information regarding participant’s use of 
nicotine replacement therapy,  tobacco and e-cigarette product  use,  and 
drug/alcohol use  
o Embedded in this section are the following standardized 
questionnaires: Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, Fagerstrom Test 
for Cigarette Dependence, Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence 
Index  
The steps for administering and reviewing questionnaires are found in the 
“Administering Forms and Questionnaires SOP.”  
The following will occur during the in-person visit : 
6.2.3  Consent  Documents 
The participant will be asked to sign the consent form (for an original copy to  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -[ZIP_CODE]   
give to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and two HIPPA forms (one for the Investigator and one for 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). These must be on source.  
 
The HIPPA form must have “entire medical record” checked off in Section B and the optional activities of banking samples checked off & initialed in Section G. Participant will be presented with the Experimental Subjects Bill of Rights.  
 
The e -consent form will be saved on the study server and held by [CONTACT_123894]. The signed consent form will be given to 5B and kept at the CTSI.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_163275] (females only). If positive for illicit drugs without a valid 
prescription, the participant will be dismissed without payment. If positive for 
pregnancy, the participant will be dismissed and paid for the visit. The “Urine Toxicology Screen SOP” and “Pregnancy Screen SOP” are references for these testing processes.  
6.2.5  Physiological  Measures  
The following physiological measures will be assessed:  
• Height and  Weight 
• Blood pressure and heart rate 
Out-of-range blood pressure and heart rates will be re- tested once via manual 
methods at the end of the visit. If still out of range, the participant will be deemed ineligible.  
Steps for these assessments are found in the “Measuring Basic Vitals SOP.”  
6.2.6  Saliva  Collection  
Participants will provide approximately 20mL of saliva for cotinine analysis. The steps for the saliva collection are found in the “Saliva Collection SOP.”  
6.2.[ADDRESS_163276] manager.  
6.2.8  End of Screening  Visit  
At the end of the in- person screening visit, the participant will be asked to fill out a 
“Certificate of Participation” in order to receive compensation for the screening 
visit. The participant will be given a urine sample cup to take home. If eligible, they 
will provide a urine sample in this cup and bring in on the day of their orientation.  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -[ZIP_CODE]   
The participant will be dismissed and the CRC will inform them that they will be 
contact[CONTACT_99017] 1 week with eligibility results from the screening visit.  
The participant’s urine will be discarded and the CRC will store the participant’s saliva in the freezer at the UCSF Tobacco Research Center lab. The saliva samples will be labeled with the Study ID and transferred to the Benowitz Lab at the end of the day on Wednesday afternoons. The CRC will complete a Screening Log on the 
Shared Lab Drive filling in information on the samples dropped off. Cotinine 
results will be expected the following Monday.  
Participant Screening and Enrollment Log Passcode:  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_163277].  
At the remote orientation visit, the following will occur:  
• The CRC will review with the participant 5B location, procedures and reminders  to 
not use combusted marijuana and to not smoke from 10PM the night before their 
5B admission 
• Participants will watch a training video on JUUL  
• Participants will be given two flavors to choose from (menthol and  tobacco)  
• Participants will collect approximately 150 mL of urine. This will be done at home right after the Zoom visit is complete. This will serve as Baseline total nicotine equivalents as a measure of usual daily intake of  nicotine.  
• Participants  will conduct  a “curb -side  pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up/drop  off” their  urine to be aliquoted 
into two 20mL vials; one vial pH  adjusted.  
• They will be given their own JUUL device and selected pods (1 -2) to use for one 
whole day before the 5B admission. This will be done within the same day as the Zoom visit, the day before their 5B  admission.  
• If CTSI CRS is available during the orientation, participant and CRC will go to 5B  for 
nurses to conduct a quick vein check. This is for the nurses to inspect the participant’s veins and ensure a successful access the morning of the study.  
• Participants will be randomized, using a Latin square design, to distinguish which 
ARM the participant will start off first for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143517]  1.

Primary Objectives:  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1080680] patients.   
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1080681] of caregiver distress and burden on overall patient survival and 
length of patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
 
1.4 To identify common characteristics of caregivers who report significantly more  feeling s of 
burden  or distress.   
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Hematopo ietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an established  treatment for certain hematologic 
malignancies1. The process of undergoi ng HSCT is intense and time consuming.  Patients and 
their caregivers are required to commit to several months of treatment  and close follow -up.  At 
our institution, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Northside Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], t he transplant  
process incl udes frequent, if not daily, visits to the clinic, and at times lengthy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785622].  Our program require s patients  to have a full -time caregiver to assist them with 
transportation, treatment compliance, nutritional intake and emotional support.  Patients are not 
allowed to be alone, go to public areas, or independently manage their medications.  Patients are 
most commonly  out of work for extended periods of time.  The need for a caregiver places an 
extra burden on the patient and their l oved ones, as caregivers are not able to work full time 
while caring for an HSCT patient.  Many studies have looked at the quality of life and various 
psychological symptoms in patients undergoing  HSCT.   Studies have analyzed the impact of 
HSCT on patient  health related quality of life (HRQOL) during and after HSCT.  However, l ittle 
is known about the impact of HSCT on spouses/partners or other primary caregivers.  
 
The process of serving as a caregiver for a loved one going through HSCT is rigorous  and 
stressful.  Much of the psychosocial support that exists in transplant centers focuse s on the 
patients with little support for the caregivers.  Friends and family also tend to place emphasis on 
the patient undergoing the treatment and give less attention to the patient’s caregiver.  Even with 
the presence of community support groups and education from the transplant programs, 
caregivers typi[INVESTIGATOR_785623].  Caregivers often express feeling 
the weight of the world on them, as  they are left to worry about everything outside of transplant 
(i.e. finances, child care) , in addition  to being  very concerned with the patient’s health .  They 
feel a sense of responsibility for the  patient improving medically.   
 
More recently, transplan t program s have begun to identify needs of HSCT caregivers.  
Researchers have begun to recognize caregivers as an important and often overlooked participant 
Version 10-16-[ADDRESS_1080682] on the caregiver’s level of burden, 
depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, fatigue and overall distress.  It will also examine if 
caregiver burden leads to  an increase  in the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785624].  In 
addition,  we hope to identify  these caregiver symptoms as they relate to the patient’s overall 
functioning.  Therefore, each patient will also complete self -report measures in orde r to assess if 
the patient’s level of distress impacts the caregivers’ functioning.  The patients will complete 
self-report measures assessing symptoms o f psychological distress, pain and fatigue and these 
scores will be matched to their particular caregiv er.

6.0 A DVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  
 
Adverse events are further defined as “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” 15 
 
Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_785627].   All Adverse Events will be graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0.  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf  
 
Due to the non -treatment nature of this protocol, there are not expected to be any adverse events. 
However, should a patient experience an adverse event that is specifically related to participation 
in this study, the following reporting criteria will apply.  Patients will be followed through Day 
[ADDRESS_1080684] 
within 24 hours of notifi cation of event.  Written report will follow within 10 working days.   
Serious adverse events will be reported for a period of one (1) year post -transplant.   
 
6.2  Definition of Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events:  
Version 10-16-15 
 7  
Serious Adverse Events are defined as one of the following:  
a. Death  
b. Life-Threatening  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged)  
d. Disability  
e. Congenital Anomaly  
f. Requires Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage  
 
Unexpected  is defined as:  
Not previously reported with the agents/devices  or procedures being undertaken.  Symptomatically 
and pathophysiologically related to known toxicity but differs because of greater severity than 
previously reported.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1080685] ICAL CONSIDERATIONS /DATA ANALYSIS  
 
8.1 We will plan to accrue 50 autologous and 50 allogeneic patient /caregiver dyad s. This number 
of patients will be sufficient to perform an initial analysis to examine levels of distress and 
associated outcome variables.  We expect that patients will be accrued over 1-[ADDRESS_1080686] 
on the caregiver’s level of burden, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, fatigue and overall 
distres s.  It will also examine if caregiver burden leads to an increase in the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785626].  In addition, we hope to identify these caregiver symptoms as 
they relate to the patient’s overall functioning.  The analysis will include t -tests to look at 
correlations, as well as more complex statistical procedures (e.g., manova, and multiple 
regression analyses) to identify relationships between variables.

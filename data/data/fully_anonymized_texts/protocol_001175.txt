Abstract:   Among the negative side effects of narcotics is respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].  The risks of respi[INVESTIGATOR_47693] -existing sleep apnea.  The obese patient population 
is predisposed to sleep apnea and are a growing populat ion, increasingly presenting for gastric by[CONTACT_47704] a means to lose the excess weight.  One drug which can decrease the need for narcotics while 
still delivering good pain relief is ketamine.  It is our hypothesis that an intra operative infusion of  
ketamine will decrease the amount of post -operative  narcotics required for adequate pain relief and 
thereby [CONTACT_47705].  
 
Background :  According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), approximately one th ird of American 
adults, about 78.6 million, are obese.  Obesity contributes greatly to healthcare costs in this country 
accounting for $[ADDRESS_50481] with varied efficacy  and long term success rates. With 
caloric reduction as the initial treatment it was found that after 6 months there is a reduction in initial 
body weight of about 8%; however beyond 4 -5 years the amount of weight loss drops off to 4% .[ADDRESS_50482] ric By[CONTACT_47706] “that patients lose about 2/3 to 3/[ADDRESS_50483] 1/2 
of the excess over 5 to 15 years.” [ADDRESS_50484] been shown to provide 
greater and longer lasting weight loss compared to conservative measures such as caloric restriction.  
Among surgical interventions, gastric by[CONTACT_47707] t han vertical 
banded gastroplasty .4   It is therefore probable that anesthesia providers will be seeing an increasing 
number of obese patients presenting for gastric by[CONTACT_47708].  The tremendous healthcare 
costs related to obesity as well as  the high success rate of gastric by[CONTACT_6476] “a loss of 50% of excess weight 
as long as 14 years postoperatively”[ADDRESS_50485] -
operative  narcotic related respi[INVESTIGATOR_47694] 77% of those cases, the patie nt suffered death 
or severe bra in damage.    The review article found that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_47695] “ an obese adult patient with severe OSA 
receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_47696],  oxygen supplementation or 
CPAP” and obese adult patients are the population receiving laparoscopic  gastric by[CONTACT_6476].  In the 
American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Guidelines for the Perioperative Management of  Patients 
with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, the ASA and its consultants make the statement that “the potential for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_47697]”.    The ASA also 
makes the desirability of opi[INVESTIGATOR_47698] i n this population clear by [CONTACT_47709]  “strongly agree that to 
reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents and other modalities (e.g., ice, 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) should be considered if appropriate”.     
 
 One m edication that shows promise in the management of this group is ketamine.  Ketamine is 
a dissociative anesthetic with well documented analgesic properties.     The primary aspect of interest is 
that ketamine delivers pain relief which lasts beyond its expe cted effective time; it was found that 
preemptive administration of ketamine and administration of an infusion throughout abdominal surgery 
resulted in a decrease narcotic requirements when compared to the group who received a bolus of 
ketamine at abdomina l closure; even though both groups had similar pain scores the infusion group had 
a lower narcotic requirement for two days after surgery.[ADDRESS_50486] for the obese population is that  ketamine  maintains functional 
residual capacity (FRC) and increases the rib cage’s contribution to tidal breathing8 making respi[INVESTIGATOR_47699] a concern with ketamine than with narcotic pain medication immediately after the 
surgery, which can be important in a population (obese patients) alrea dy predisposed to sleep apnea.  
 A study performed by [CONTACT_47710] -incisional ketamine along with an in fusion to a single 
dose given post incision closure.  After the surgery, pain scales and amount of narcotic used by [CONTACT_47711] a single bolus of ketamine.[ADDRESS_50487] 
operation.  
 
Specific Aims:   This study will attempt to determine if it is possible to reduce the post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_47700] -operative infusion of ketamine.  This study will 
compare  two groups of patients presenting for gastric by[CONTACT_4897].  The two groups w ill be 
randomized to a control group who will receive a standard, narcotic based pain relief anesthetic and the 
study group which will rece ive an intra operative  ketamine infusion.  After the surgery the patients’ 
narcotic use and pain scores will be followed for [ADDRESS_50488] -operative  narcotic requirements.  
Research Plan :  The study will be a  head to head experiment with one group receiving narcotic 
medication during the surgery and the other group receiving a ketamine infusion .  Both groups will 
receive [ADDRESS_50489] year  and it was estimated that to see a 30% reduction in narcotic use we 
would need two groups of 24, emphasizin g that this would be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  The study by [CONTACT_47712] “cumulative morp hine consumption on D1 and D2 
was reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 40%”.[ADDRESS_50490] Friedman, performs between three and five 
laparoscopic gastric by[CONTACT_47713] a 
reasonable amount of time.  
The ketamine  group will receive 100 mcg of fentanyl at induction of anesthesia  and then no 
further narcotics during the surgery .    During  induction the patient will receive  a 20 mg bolu s of 
ketamine, a dose of propofol deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_47714] a dose of neuromuscular blocking medication  followed by [CONTACT_47715] 5 mcg/kg/min beginning after induction, and ending at the beginning of wound closure.  
The narcotic group will receiv e no ketamine but rather a more standard anesthetic consisting of  
100 mcg of fentanyl,  a dose of propofol deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_47716] a dose of neuromuscular blocking medication  for induction .   Intraoper atively 
only the narcotic group will be  given intraoperative  boluses of fentanyl and 0.3 mg of hydromorphone 
approximately 45 minutes prior to the end of surgery.   
Both groups will receive 1 gram of Ofirmev (acetaminophen) infused over [ADDRESS_50491].  Beginning in the PACU 
amount of narcotics needed to control the patient’s pain (converted to mo rphine equivalent units) and 
pain scores  (a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47701]) will be collected for [ADDRESS_50492] hypersensitivity, 
allergy, or contraindications to fentanyl, propofol, hydromorphone or ketamine ; the medications which 
could be administered in this study.   Patients with cardiovascular disease who cannot tolerate the 
sympathomimetic effects of ketmine and  ASA [ADDRESS_50493] Friedman in his surgical clinic. If they are going 
to require gastric by[CONTACT_47717].   The 
patients will be randomized into the two treatment groups utilizing a computer generated block 
randomization to get groups of equal size in each treatment.  There will be 9 blocks of 6 and 1 block of 4 
in order to evenly divide the 58 patients.  
Patients PHI will be accessed  by [CONTACT_47718].   The only data which will be recorded will be pain scores and narcotic usage during 
the 48 hours after surgery.   Consent for participation in the study will be sc anned into the patient's 
record.  Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_47702] a locked drawer in [CONTACT_47723]'s lock office until 
converted into a digital format , consistent with the department's protocol .  The data will be analyzed 
with the help of the an esthesia departments statistical consultant.  
 
Possible Discomforts and Risks:  The patients will be undergoing gastric by[CONTACT_47719], by [CONTACT_47720], is painful.  They will be given FDA approved medications, consistent with their labeling, during 
the operation to minimize that pain.  Post operatively the patients will be given whatever medications 
they nee d to control their pain.   T he largest potential side effects of ketamine is vivid dreams which 
may be unpleasant, this side effect should be blunted  or avoided by [CONTACT_7416] -operative administration of 
versed.   As ketamine is a standard anesthetic drug, in the event of a temporary state of confusion or 
agitation related to ketamine the PACU would do as they do with any patient who has this reaction to 
ketamine and dim the lights and draw the curtains, allowing the patient to remain calmer  as they wake 
from anesthesia.  If the emergence is too distressing an additional dose of versed may be administered 
to blunt the reaction.   
 
Possible Benefits:   The pa tients could experience satisfactory pain relief while u sing less narcotics a goal 
recommended by [CONTACT_47721].  In receiving less narcotics the patients should have a lower incidence of 
negative side effects of narcotics including respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].   The benefit to future patients will be 
if we are able to show that we can both decrease use of post -operative narcotics while maintaining 
satisfactory pain relief we can utilize this as a standard anesthetic regimen and avoid some of the 
negative  and dangerous  side effects of narcotics .

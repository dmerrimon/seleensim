 Title: Collaborative -care rehabilitation to improve functional outcomes after dysvascular 
amputation 
 
 A. Abstract & Specific Aims  
The primary objective of this project is to determine the efficacy of a collaborative -care, 
home -based exercise program for improving physical function, activity level, and health 
self-management within the first year following dysvascular transtibial amputation. 
Over 1 million Americans currently liv e with lower limb amputation, and the number is expected 
to more than double by 2050.19  The increasing amputation rate is attributed to an aging 
population and increased incidence of underlying causes such as peripheral arter y disease 
(PAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) .19-22  Unfortunately, under-representation of people with 
dysvascular amputation in rehabilitation research has led to a gap in knowledge of how to 1) optimize physical rehabilitation and 2) facilitate successful health self -management for these 
patients .
23 
Due to the lack of research on rehabilitation following dysvascular  lower limb amputations, 
optimal physical rehabilitation is largely undefined.24  Traditional rehabilitation goals  focus  
narrowly on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_477000], emphasizing prosthetic function, 
mobility /gait training, and targeted remediation of physical impairments.24-27  However, t his 
approach neglects underlying comorbidities, chroni c 
physical inactivity, and history of poor health self-
management  which are all  risk factors and contribute 
to poor outcomes of dysvascular amputation. As a 
consequence, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_477001].28-31   
Considering the large, under -represented population 
with dysvascular  transtibial amputation and evidence 
of poor long-term functional outcomes, there is an immediate need to address rehabilitation practice.   
This intervention study will address impaired physical 
function, activity limitation, and health self-
management for people recovering from dysvascular transtibial amputation using innovative collaborative-care, home-based rehabilitation (Figure 1).  
Collaborative-care will pair the participant and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477002]/her physical rehabilitation and health.  In addition, home-based intervention will promote carry-over of rehabilitation gains into the functional setting of the home.   
Participants will  self-monitor  progress  and communicate regularl y with the research team  to 
advance the intervention and address barriers to successful goal achievement .  While outcome 
measures ar e standardized for all participants, intervention selection and incremental goals  will 
be participant -tailored, within specific guidelines, with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477003].  
Results of this study will  quantify the effect size of the proposed intervention and inform future 
research designed to optimiz e intervention, focus examination based on the dominant 
pathophysiology (i.e., DM, PAD, or both), and examine efficacy in other populations (e.g., patients with trans -femoral amputation).  
Specific Aim 1 : The Primary Aim (PA1), on which this trial is powered, and the Primary 
Hypotheses (H1.1 and H1.2) are: 
a) PA1: Determine if the collaborative-care, home-based rehabilitation program improves 
performance-based and participant -report measures of physical function compared to 
standard of care for participants with dysvascular transtibial amputation.   

 
 
4 
 b) H1.1: The rehabilitation program will result in greater improvements in the 
performance-based measures of the Timed Up-and-Go, [ADDRESS_611726] of care at 12 weeks (primary end-point) and persist at 24 weeks 
following initiatio n of intervention.  
c) H1.2: The rehabilitation program will result in higher ratings of participant -reported 
physical function on the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire – Mobility Section, 
Houghton Scale, and Patient -Specific Functional Scale than standard of care at 12 weeks 
(primary end-point) and persist at 24 weeks following initiation of intervention.  
Specific Aim 2 : The Secondary Aim (SA) and Hypothesis (H2) are:  
a) SA: Determine if the collaborative-care, home-based rehabilitation program improves 
physical activity when compared to standard of care for participants with dysvascular transtibial amputation.  
b) H2: The rehabilitation program will result in greater increases in physical activity than 
standard of care at 12 weeks (primary end-point) and persist at  24 weeks following 
initiation of intervention.  
Exploratory Aims :  
1. Exploratory Aim 1 (EA1) and Hypothes es (H3 & H4) are:  
a) EA1: Determine if the collaborative-care, home-based rehabilitation program 
influences the health self -management factors of  self -efficacy for managing chronic 
disease, motivation for exercise, and healthcare use.  
b) While the study will likely be under -powered to find differences related to this aim, the, 
if trends in group differences are seen, data will provide a means for performing a statistical power analysis to determine sample size for future study.  The hypothesized 
trends for group differences are:  
(1)  H3: The rehabilitation program group will tend to have greater positive change in 
ratings on the Self -Efficacy in Managing Chronic Dis ease (SEMCD) questionnaire and 
Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) Interest and Enjoyment Subscales, compared to the standard of care group at 12 and 24 weeks following initiation of intervention.  
(2) H4: The rehabilitation program group will tend to have higher numbers of attended 
healthcare provider appointments and lower numbers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477004] [ADDRESS_611727] of care group.  
2. Exploratory Aim 2 (EA2) and Hypothesis (H4) are:  
a) EA2: Identify factors predictive of physical activity level and disability measured by 
[CONTACT_477020] -reported disability (World Health Organization Disability 
Assessment Schedule 2.0), respectively.  
b) H5: Significant predictors of physical activity and disability will be identified from the 
categories of demographic/anthropometric, activity/mobility, health behaviors, physical 
health, amputated-limb health, contralateral -limb health, cognitive/affective health, and 
healthcare use factors for participants at 24 weeks following intervention, regardless of group assignment.  
 
B. Background and Significance  
B1. Significance.  Limitations in physical function are common following dysvascular major lower 
limb amputation.28,29,31  This is a significant issue considering that dysvascular amputation is 
becoming increasingly more common in the [LOCATION_002].  Dysvascular amputation is 
operationally defined as amputation resulting from severe PAD with critical limb ischemia or 
severe DM with dense distal sensory and motor neuropathy leading to a non-healing wound (or a combination of these two related, but separate pathophysiologies).  The projection of 2.3 million people living with amputation in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_2892] 2050 represents an 
increase of nearly 100% from current values.
[ADDRESS_611728] is that rehabilitation f ollowing 
dysvascular amputation is neither well -defined nor well -studied.24  While the majority of lower 
limb amputations (>80%) are dysvascular,20 available research evidence on functional 
outcomes is largely based on relatively younger populations with traumatic , congenital,  or 
cancer -related amputations.  This study bias limits the knowledge needed to develop 
rehabilitation guidelines for people following dysvascular amputation.23,24,33 
B2. Clinical Importance.  Traditional rehabilitation emphasi zes prosthetic function, mobility /gait 
training, and targeted remediation of physical impairments ,24-27,[ADDRESS_611729] improvement across the 
course of rehabilitation after  amputation,35 long-term functional outcomes are poor.28,29,36 -40  For 
example, 40-50% of patients are not community ambulator s 1 year following dysvascular 
lower limb amputation.28,41  These poor functional outcomes are likely linked to pre -
existing comorbidities and poor vascular health self -management.40,42 
Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_477005].  However, health management is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_477006], 
rather than collaborative between patient and health-care provider.  The presence of vascular 
comorbidities that lead to amputation is an indication in itself of poor patient health self -
management.  Using a patient/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477007].  Evidence indicates 
collaborative approaches to promoting health self -management improve vascular risk factor  
outcomes.
43,44  In addition, home -based intervention can effectively improve physical function 
and activity in people with chronic health problems.45,46  As an example, Vernooij and 
colleagues44 found patient/provider collaboration for managing vascular risk factors led to 
reduced risk factors over a [ADDRESS_611730]. Cory Christiansen (PI) has experience in design, 
implementation, and publication of clinical research studies involving older adult patients with activity limitations related to a variety of age- and health-related problems.

data collection phases.
49,53  In addition, he is currently the PI [INVESTIGATOR_477008] ( Section C2). [CONTACT_477026] is also currently serving as co -investigator in a nearly -complete study examining 
physical activity and biomechanical outcome measures for patients following traumatic transtibial amputation.

C2. Physical Function Outcomes Related to Prosthetic Rehabilitation after Dysvascular 
Transtibial Amputation (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_477009]).  This in-progress pi[INVESTIGATOR_477010] (first 3 months) after dysvascular transtibial amputation.  The study involves  collaboration between rehabilitation clinics at five large regional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477011] 
(The University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Denver Health,  The VA,  Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and Poudre 
Valley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ); with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_477012].  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_477013] 1) demonstrated the PI’s ability to coordinate a multi -site study for a population similar to

 the proposed study and 2) begun to characterize 
physical function over the course of rehabilitation following dysvascular transtibial amputation.  Initial data 
illustrate that patients with dysvascular transtibial 
amputation achieve meaningful gains in physical function measures with standard of care rehabilitation (Table 1).  Yet, g ains are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_477014]; 
reported function is significantly lower 1-[ADDRESS_611732] guided development of the proposed

 based rehabilitation program are to: 1) improve physical impairments with targeted 
exercise, 2) increase physical activity through a home walking program and 3) optimize 
patient health self -management.  The collaborative-care,  home-based rehabilitation program 
was developed based on self -management programs for patients with chronic disease,45,46,[ADDRESS_611734] of care 
guidelines based on professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],34,63,64 and 
clinician input from the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102476] (Table 3).   Physical impairments and 
functional limitations will be individually identified at 
initial testing and interventions chosen with 
collaboration of participant and researcher.  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_242464]/week via phone to discuss progress toward i ndividual intervention 
goals.  Barriers to achieving goals will be discussed and new goals created on a weekly basis during the phone or home visits.   
The exercise program  will be tailored to each 
participant and includes targeted exercise to strengthen trunk, hip, knee, and ankle musculature (Table 3).  Weakness in these muscle groups is identified in the literature
36,65 and by [CONTACT_477021].  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477015], based 
on participant -specific muscle weakness identified during rehabilitation.  The participant (along 
with researcher collaboration) will then identify specific exercises from a menu of progressive 
exercises to target each muscle.  Exercises will be performed at  home independently by [CONTACT_2416], assessed weekly and advanced through participant -researcher interaction, with the 
goal of performing strengthening exercises 3 days/week for 20 minutes/session.  
Other exercises target hip and knee joint contracture prevention, two common joint mobility problems for patients with transtibial amputation.
63  Presence of contractures of the hip and/or 
knee are predictors of poor physical rehabilitation outcome.35  Included are static stretches (e.g., 
prone lying and seated with knee propped into extension) performed 2-3 X/week for 2 minutes each (total 4 minutes).  
The walking program  will be performed all [ADDRESS_611735] 3X/week.  
Initial walk duration will be determined at the first visit and goals set weekly by [CONTACT_477022] a guideline of at least [ADDRESS_611736] improved symptoms, walking 
distance, and quality of life for people with PAD.
45,46   
Health self -management will be promoted in 3 primary ways: 1) action plan development with 
participant -directed goal setting, 2) participant self -tracking of activity (pedometers and exercise 
diary), and 3) participant education on problem -solving skills to manage chronic health 
conditions.  Participants will also monitor their individual health condition (e.g., heart rate, time 
to claudication with walking, blood sugar, and blood pressure).  These data will focus the weekly 
discussions (home or phone) over the 12-weeks.44,66,67 
Control (CTL) Group: CTL group participants will be contact[CONTACT_477023] (phone and 
home visits) as the EXP group (Figure 2) to ensure attention control between groups.  Visi ts will 

 
 
[ADDRESS_611737] of recording problems reported by [CONTACT_2299].  If health or rehabilitation questions 
arise that require professional advice during participant -researcher visits, the participant will be 
referred to his/her healthcare provider.  
D5. Data  Analysis .  Data will be managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; 
which is HIPA A compliant ).68  Primary anal ysis will be group differences in TUG times  (primary 
outcome)  at the 12-week time point.  As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], data will only be analyzed for 
participants with sufficient intervention exposure, defined as six weeks.  For participants who 
withdraw at or beyond six weeks of intervention, an early termination test will be performed and 
carried forward as the end-point.  Participants who withdraw before completing six weeks will be 
lost to follow -up and no imputation will be performed for missing data.   Attempts will be made to 
test all participants at 24-week s.  However, missing 24-week data will not be imputed from the 
[ADDRESS_611738] following the primary end-point (i.e., it is 
expected that both groups would have w orse 24- compared to 12-week outcomes).  Group 
differences will be based on a linear model with TUG as the outcome and explanatory variables being primary medical diagnosis (PAD, DM, or both), rehabilitation site, treatment group, and 
baseline TUG. Group differences will be determined by [CONTACT_477024] I error (α level: 0.05). 
Secondary analyses will include differences at 12-weeks in the other outcomes (2MW, 5mW, 
PEQ-MS 12/5, Houghton Scale, PSFS, Activity level , number of healthc are provider visits, and 
number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85423]) using the same method as for the primary outcome.  A mixed-
effects model with time as a fixed covariate across baseline, 12-, and 24-weeks will be used to evaluate long-term outcomes (24-week) and make inferences regarding the effectiveness of the intervention up to 12-weeks after intervention is complete.  As with the other analyses, 
evaluation of the time trajectory will be conditioned on stratification variables and baseline values of the outcome measure.   Also the mixed-effects model will not include data from 
subjects who drop prior to [ADDRESS_611739], variables will be grouped into demographic/anthropometric, 
activity/mobility, health behaviors, physical health, amputated-limb health, contralateral -limb 
health, and cognitive/affective health, and healthcare use factors.   A hierarchical process will be 
used to screen variables within each group of factors to identify the best predictors within each group.   Finally, the best predictor variables from each group will be entered into a regression 
model to determine models containing subsets of the variables that predict the outcome, based 
on R
2adj.  The most parsimonious model will be identified by [CONTACT_17921] [ADDRESS_611740] models, 
using partial F -tests  
D6. Sample Size Estimate .  Sample size was estimated using TUG means and variances at 
discharge from the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  In addition, literature was used to estimate long-term (> 
[ADDRESS_611741] -amputation) TUG scores for the population.60-62,69,70  Using 12.4 (3.9)  seconds 
mean (SD) TUG time at rehabilitation discharge from the first 14 participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_50382] 19.3 seconds as the average of TUG time reported for patients several months to years 
after amputation, a group difference of approximately 6.0 seconds was expected in TUG times 
at the 12-week time-point (primary end-point).  With this group difference and an estimated SD of 6.0 (effect size = 1.0), 17 participants per group would provide 80% power to identify differences.  The assumption is the EXP  group will maintain or improve TUG times after the 12-
week  intervention and the CTL group will decline toward levels reported in the literature. A 3.4 
second change in TUG represents a minimal detectable change for patients with lower limb amputation.
69  
The goal is to enroll 44 participants  and graduate 17 participants per group (n=34) at the 12-
week test point.  Based on data from the four participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 150 patients will complete 
rehabilitation and achieve functional ambulation following dysvascular transtibial amputation 
 
 
9 
 over the next 3 years.  Based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ( Section C 2), 60% of these patients are 
expected to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (n = 90) and 50% of those will agree to participate 
(n = 45).  A 20% loss to follow -up at 12 weeks (n=34) is estimated, which is  twice the observed 
rates of studies with 12-week end-points that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_477016].   
D7 Outcome Measures .  Participant s will have three test sessions of 1.5 hours each (initial, 12-
week (primary end-point ), 24-week) beginning within three weeks of completing outpatient 
rehabilitation.  All sessions will occur at  the participant’s home or Interdisciplinary Movement 
Science Lab (IMSL) , whichever is more convenient for the participant,  using standardized 
protocols by [CONTACT_21171] .   
• Physical Function Outcomes: Three physical performance tests will be used: the Timed Up-
and-Go (TUG)1, 2-Minute Walk (2MW)2, 5-meter Walk (5mW)3, and Singl e-Limb Stance 
tests.  Self-report measures of physical function include the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire – Mobility Section (PEQ -MS)
4,71, Houghton Scale5, Patient -Specific Functional 
Scale (PSFS)6, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0.   
Each of these are reliable and valid measures for people with chroni c disease.4,62,69,72 -76  
• Activity Measurement : Physical activity will be assessed with physical activity monitors 
(Actigraph) worn for [ADDRESS_611742] session.  These monitors are valid tools for 
measuring rel ative level of activity (e.g., sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous) for various 
patient populations7-9 and are valid and reliable spatiotemporal gait measures for patients 
with lower limb amputation.11,77  
• Self-Efficacy and Motivation: Self -efficacy and exercise motivation will be used as 
descriptive measures related to health self -management.  The Self -Efficacy in Managing 
Chronic Disease (SEMCD)  questionnaire has been used as an outcome for self -
management of various chronic diseases.12,13  The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) 
Interest and Enjoyment Subscale measures participant -reported interest and enjoyment 
related to the intervention.14  Participant compliance with daily health monitoring will be 
tracked as number of days missed/possible days.  
Procedural reliability is critical to the success of the proposed and future studies with multiple 
clinical sites.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_477017].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] 2-3 training sessions, including a training manual, for each 
designated tester. If procedural reliability is below 0.90, additional training sessions will be scheduled.

Treatment 
Regimen for Camostat mesilate  
(Standard dose)  • Camostat  mesilate and placebo  tablets  will be administered  orally, 
one hour prior to eating, and at bedtime. 
• The total duration of treatment is expected  to be 10 days.  
Duration of Study 
Participation  The total anticipated duration of the study for each patient  is 28 days.  
Statistical Methods  To address our primary objective, the AUC SARS -CoV2 viral RNA 
levels during follow- up will be estimated using the linear trapezoidal 
method, and mean  AUC levels compared  between  groups using a linear 
regression model regressin g log(AUC) on treatment arm, site, age, and 
sex. The test will be performed at the two -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_6804] will be performed at the two-sided  alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_6805] 
ratio for shedding cessation will be estimated, along with its 95% confidence interval,  from a Cox proportional hazards model. We will use 
this same approach to model the secondary endpoints of clinical worsening and mortality. If the proportional hazards assumption is not met, we will consider an extended Cox model that relaxes the proportional hazards assumption. The log rank test will also be 
performed.  
The distribution of viral shedding cessation will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and Kaplan- Meier curves will be presented for 
each treatment arm. Median  time to shedding cessation  along with 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment arm.  
 
Median  time to resolution  of symptoms  will be estimated  along  with 95% 
confidence intervals by [CONTACT_7539]. The frequency of adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7540].  
AEs will be compared  by [CONTACT_7541]-squared test or Fisher’s  exact 
test, as appropriate, in the safety analysis set.  
 
An interim analysis for safety and overwhelming efficacy will be 
performed  once  50% of patients  have  [ADDRESS_6806]  should  be removed  from  camostat  mesilate  treatment  if one of

coronavirus has been identified as the causative pathogen of a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_7505]. COVID -19, originally 
identified  in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, has now spread  across the globe and has been 
declared by [CONTACT_7543] a global pandemic. While the majority of infected patients display mild symptoms  if any, death  rates of up to 4% due to development of severe acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_7497] 
(COVID- 19 SARS), have been reported in patients with co- morbid conditions and in the elderly 
population. The only available treatment  for COVID-19 illness  is remdesivir but its use is currently 
limited  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7506]. With the unprecedented global health and economic threats imposed by [CONTACT_4113] -19,

The mechanisms associated with the infectiousness of SARS -CoV- 2 are not clear; however, 
structural analysis suggests it is likely entering human cells through the ACE2 receptor (Zhou et 
al., 2020). Considering the adverse outcomes of the current COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], developi[INVESTIGATOR_7508], high mortality 
rate, and the potential of the virus to cause further epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509] (Khan et al., 2020). 
 
2.2 Preclinical  and In Vitro  Experiences 
The hypothesis that the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 plays a critical role in the life cycle of SARS -CoV-2 is supported primarily  by 2 lines  of evidence. Using  a panel of established 
human  cell lines,  Matsuyama et al. (2020) have shown  that SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_6811] cell. Independently, Hoffmann et al. (2020) have shown that SARS -CoV-2 cell entry  depends on the ACE2  receptor and TMPRSS3  activity,  the latter resulting 
from the ability of the protease to prime the viral spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein. The case for camostat as a pharmacologic inhibitor of TMPRSS2  also stems  from  2 lines  of evidence.  In the same  study cited 
above (Hoffmann et al., 2020), camostat was shown to block viral entry in vitro. Furthermore, 
because the same mechanism involving ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is also in the entry of the closely related SARS -CoV coronavirus in human cells, animal studies with  this respi[INVESTIGATOR_7510] -19 therapy. Zhou et al. (2015) have shown that camostat was effective in 
protecting  mice  against death  due to a lethal infection  by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV,  with a survival rate of ~60%. 
Together, these findings suggest that  camostat  may be an effective treatment  and prophylactic for 
patients  infected  with  SARS -CoV- 2. The inhibitory  effects  of camostat  on various proteases  were 
compared with those of FOY -251 (the major metabolite of camostat). As compared to camostat, 
the inhibitory effect  of FOY-251 on trypsin -catalyzed  hydrolysis of TAMe  was 1/2, that on 

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  04 DEC  2020  
Confidential  Page  14 of 42  
 caseinolysis was 1/5, that on plasmin catalyzed fibrinogen degradation was 1/3, thrombin - 
catalyzed fibrin coagulation was equivalent, and those on plasma kallikrein and pancreatic 
kallikrein were 1/7 and 1/2, respectively. 
 
Decreased locomotor activity, convulsions, loss of righting reflex, external irritation, hypersensitivity, and dyspnea were observed in rats at extremely high doses of 3,000 mg/kg or higher orally  (p.o.). However,  no effects were  observed on the central  nervous system  at doses up 
to 2,000 mg/kg, p.o., in mice, or on the autonomic nervous system at doses ranging between 100 
and 500 mg/kg, p.o., in rats. No changes in blood pressure were observed in rats at doses ranging 
between [ADDRESS_6812], trachea, and blood. 
 
2.3 Clinical Experience  
Camostat/Foipan  has been extensively  used in pancreatitis  patients  for more  than 20 years  in Japan. 
The clinical development program in Japan consisted of the following studies: 
• A Phase I tolerability study was conducted in which camostat mesilate was administered 
postprandially at doses of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and [ADDRESS_6813]-dose. 
 
• A dose -response exploratory early Phase II study in remission of acute symptoms of 
chronic pancreatitis. This preliminary clinical study was conducted in which camostat 
mesilate 300mg/day and 600 mg/day was administered  3 times  daily  after each  meal  for 6 
consecutive weeks in patients with chronic pancreatitis.  
 
• A Phase II double -blind comparative study was conducted in which patients with 
postoperative reflux esophagitis received FOIPAN 300 mg/day (Group L), 600 mg/day (Group M), and 900mg/day (Group H) for 8 weeks. 
 
• A Phase II double -blind comparative clinical s tudy was conducted in which patients with 
postoperative reflux esophagitis, subjective symptoms, endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_7511], hemorrhage, ulcer,  white  film,  redness,  etc., received  FOIPAN  300 mg/day (Group H) and 
90mg/day in unidentifiable tablets containing  [ADDRESS_6814] (Group  L) for 8 weeks.  
 
• A Japanese double -blind controlled study for emission of acute symptoms of chronic 
pancreatitis was conducted using FOIPAN 600 mg/day (Group F) and placebo (Group P) in patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis by [CONTACT_7545], morphologic examination, or pancreatic function test based  on diagnostic criteria  of the Japan  Pancreas 
Society, and who had an elevated  serum/urine  amylase level  and acute symptoms  of upper 
abdominal pain and/or tenderness, and were capable of taking oral medication. The treatment period was 2 weeks and the observation period was 4 weeks until 2 weeks after the end of treatment.

Society, and who had an elevated  serum/urine  amylase level  and acute symptoms  of upper 
abdominal pain and/or tenderness, and were capable of taking oral medication. The 
treatment period was 2 weeks and the observation period was 4 weeks until 2 weeks after the end of treatment. 
 
A Phase I study in 14 healthy young men of 2400 mg per day for seven days with the dose given 30 minutes or one hour pre-prandially. Fasting and non- fasting drug levels 
were  compared and subjects were  assessed  for adverse events and to compare drug levels 
in fasting state, at 30 and 60 minutes before eating and with food. 
 
Implementation  of a controlled study as a Phase  III study was considered  but based  on the results 
of comparison  of the Group H (300 mg/day) with the Group L (90 mg/day) in the Phase  II double- 
blind controlled study, it was determined that a placebo-controlled study was not necessary.

2.5 Rationale for 200 mg dose  four times  per day given  one hour  before meals  
In a recent study, the IC50 for camostat for coronavirus was found to be 4.3 nM (Hoffmann et al. 
2020 Preprint) . In the presence of serum,  however, camostat  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_7512]50 of 70.3. This is similar to previous reports of an IC50 of 87.  The Cmax of Camostat and 
GBPA in blood noted above (87.1 ng/ml) with a 200 mg  dosing is thus barely  sufficient  to reliably 
inhibit the virus.  There  is precedent,  however, in US for using a higher dose of 200 mg four times 
daily; a trial of camostat  for Covid- [ADDRESS_6817] at Mayo  Clinic  is using this 800 mg dose 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Moreover, providing the drug one hour before meals can maximize  the Cmax  as 
is evident in the figure below using a [ADDRESS_6818] dosage for Camostat is 
200 mg one hour before and two hours after meals and at bedtime. 
 
 
2.6 Rationale for 10-day Dosing  Regimen  
The indicated dose of camostat/Foipan  has been  extensively used in pancreatitis patients for 
more than 20 years in Japan. 
 
2.7 Rationale for the Current  Study  
There is a global pandemic caused by [CONTACT_7547] -CoV- 2 virus, which threatens the lives of many 
and the economic stability of the world. Therapeutic approaches are badly needed, and an orally 
available, well tolerated small molecule agent could play a critical part in preventing and ameliorating COVID -19.

• If coagulation assays are ordered as part of the SOC,  the results  should be added to the EDC.  
Including Clinical Laboratory Testing, subjects will undergo four planned venipunctures during 
this study. 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_6841]- treatment.  
Subjects will be instructed to report AEs during the study and staff will query subjects regarding AEs throughout the study. The Investigator (and/or designee) must document all AEs reported through completion of the Day [ADDRESS_6842]’s source documentation and CRF  
 
8.3.2 Definition  of an Adverse Event  
The FDA  Safety  Guidance,  referencing  21CFR312.32(a), defines an Adverse Event  as follows:  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug  
in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An 
adverse  event  can arise  with any use of the drug (e.g., off-label  use, use in combination with 
another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  04 DEC  2020  
Confidential  Page  27 of 42  
 Adverse Events are NOT : 
• Clinical events  related  to the progression  of COVID- 19. 
• Medical  or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion). 
The condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations where  an untoward  medical  occurrence has not occurred  (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7520], social and/or convenience admissions).  
 
8.3.3 Evaluating and Reporting  of Adverse Events  
All AEs (i.e.  a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) that occur after dosing 
with camostat mesilate and after completion of baseline assessments in the SOC + placebo arm, 
must be recorded as an AE or SAE (if applicable), on the Adverse Event eCRF and SAE form, as 
applicable. The Investigator must follow all AEs until the AE resolves, or until the Investigator 
and/or the Medical Monitor determine the event is chronic or clinically stable.  If an AE remains 
unresolved at the conclusion of the study, the Investigator and Medical  Monitor will make  a clinical 
assessment to determine whether continued follow -up of the AE is warranted. All subjects who 
have received  at least one exposure to study therapy  will be evaluated  for safety  of study treatment.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms and/or other  clinical  information. In such cases,  the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and 
not the individual signs/symptoms. 
All AEs must be promptly documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and assessed by [CONTACT_3786].  Details of the event must include the dates of onset and resolution, severity, 
relationship  to study drug, seriousness,  and whether the  event  caused  the subject to  withdraw from 
the study, outcome and timing  with regard  to administration  of the study drug. We will categorize 
the AES  using the Division of AIDS  Table  for Grading the Severity  of Adult  and Pediatric  Adverse 
Events.  
Severity:  Severity  should be graded  and recorded  as follows: 
• Grade  1 Mild:  No or minimal  interference with usual activities;  intervention  not indicated  
• Grade  2 Moderate:  Greater  than minimal  interference  with usual  activity; intervention  indicated  
• Grade 3 Severe: Inability to carry out usual activity, incapacitating; requires intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Grade 4 Potentially life -threatening: Inability to perform self- care; intervention indicated to  
prevent permanent impairment, disability or death 
• Grade 5 Death  
Relationship: The relationship of the Adverse Event to the study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_1268], and assessed using the following definitions: 
• Related: There is a distinct temporal relationship between the event onset and administration 
of the study drug. There  is a known reaction  to agent or chemical  group or predicted  by [CONTACT_7552]. The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
• Unrelated:  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre - 
existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication ). 

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  04 DEC  2020  
Confidential  Page  28 of 42  
 These criteria,  in addition to good clinical  judgment, should be used as a guide for determining the 
causal  assessment.  If it is felt that the event is not related  to study drug therapy, then an alternative 
explanation should be provided. 
 
8.3.4 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs as defined below and that occur after the first dose of camostat mesilate and up to Day 
[ADDRESS_6843] also be reported.  
 
8.3.5 Definition  of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE  is an AE from  this study that results  in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  (even  if caused by  [CONTACT_4113]-19 all deaths  are recorded as SAEs)  
• Life-threatening  situation  (subject is at immediate  risk of death) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  in the offspring of a subject  who received  study drug 
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or sur gical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
A life-threatening AE is defined as any adverse experience that places the subject in the view  of the 
Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  This does not include an 
event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity. 
“Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”  means the subject has been  formally  admitted  to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7521], for any length of time with a minimum one overnight stay. Presentation and care within 
an emergency  department  does not necessarily  constitute  an SAE.  Complications  that occur  during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
 
8.3.6 SAE  Reporting Requirements to the Sponsor  
The procedure for reporting SAEs, regar dless of causal relationship , is as follows:  
• Within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of an SAE, the site must notify the Sponsor 
by [CONTACT_7553], medical monitor or other Sponsor representative. They 
should also immediately complete the AE eCRF and select “Serious”.  
• This initial reporting of an SAE should contain as much information as is available to the 
Investigator.  Submission of the SAE via the EDC should not be delayed in order to collect 
additional information to complete the form. 
• Follow- up SAE reports may be generated in cases in which additional information becomes 
available.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], autopsy reports, and other documents may become available and 
scanned copi[INVESTIGATOR_7522]. The follow -up SAE report 
should describe whether the event  has resolved  or continues, if and how it was treated,  whether 

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  [ADDRESS_6844] continued or withdrew from study 
participation.  
• The Sponsor will distribute  completed  SAE  forms,  which  may be used to notify  the IRB when 
applicable, via a secure internet -based doc ument depository.  
• The Investigator should notify the IRB of Serious Adverse Events occurring at the site and other 
adverse reports received from the Sponsor in accordance with local procedures.  
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE.  Any 
medications necessary  for treatment  of the SAE  must be recorded  onto the concomitant medication 
section of the subject’s eCRF.  However, treatment medication should  only be recorded in the 
narrative description section of the SAE form.  
 
8.4 Suspected  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R carries specific and time-based  reporting requirements  for the Sponsor of a clinical  trial. 
Thus, after an Investigator reports  an SAE,  the FDA expects the Sponsor will determine  whether it 
meets the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R. 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is defined according to 3 criteria: 
1. The AE is deemed a “suspected adverse reaction” if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the AE. A “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and adverse event.  
2. The AE is “Serious” if it meets the definition  of an SAE  provided in section  8.3.5  
3. The AE is deemed  “unexpected” if it is not listed  in the Investigator’s  Brochure (IB) or if in the 
IB, has not been reported at the severity observed.  
In cases where the Sponsor deems a S[LOCATION_003]R has occurred, it must file an IND Safety Report with the FDA.  Sponsorwill require  the assistance and cooperation of the Investigator and staff to provide 
accurate and complete information  on the subject and observed SAE  so that reporting  requirements 
to the FDA can be met.  
 
8.4.1  Reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs  to the FDA:  IND Safety  Reports  
IND safety  repo rts are used to submit reports of S[LOCATION_003]Rs  to the FDA.  There  are 2 types of reports:  
• A “15 -day report” is used when the reported SAE is a S[LOCATION_003]R and requires that as much 
information as is available to the investigator and the sponsor, be submitted to the FDA in on the appropriate form. For US trials, the appropriate form is the FDA Form 35 00A also 
commonly known as a “MedWatch” form. 
• A “7-day report”  is used when  the S[LOCATION_003]R  is considered  to be fatal or life-threatening.  
The 7 -day and 15- day timelines begin the day that the Investigator learns of the event and are 
counted in calendar days – not business days.  Therefore, it is important that the investigator 
carefully follow the reporting requirements described in section 8.3.6. 
 
8.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities  and Other  Abnormal  Assessments 
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as AEs unless considered to be clinically significant  by [CONTACT_7554].   An  abnormal laboratory  result  will be considered  an AE if it 

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  04 DEC  2020  
Confidential  Page  30 of 42  
 induces clinical signs or symptoms, if the abnormality is of a degree that requires active 
management (e.g. discontinuation of the study drug, dose modification) or when the event is requiring treatment or other therapeutic  intervention (e.g. iron supplements, blood transfusion, etc.).  
The Investigator will evaluate the relationship of any significantly abnormal result to protocol treatment and clinical condition, if possible.  All clinically significant abnormal laboratory results 
will be followed until they return to normal or become stabilized.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_6845]  be recorded, 
assessed for seriousness, and reported as an SAE.  
 
9 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
Complete details of all statistical analyses, including methods for handling missing data, will be included in a formal statistical analysis plan (SAP), to be completed as soon as possible.  
 
9.1 General  Considerations  
 
For the primary  comparison, the following will be tested:  
 
• Null hypothesis: AUC of viral shedding through day 10 is equal in control and treatment; 
• Alternative  hypothesis: AUC of viral shedding through day 10 differs between control and 
treatment.  
 
Hypothesis tests will be two sided  and conducted at an overall alpha = 0.05 level  of significance.  
 
The number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7523], with 95% confidence intervals.  The frequency of adverse events  and serious adverse events will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_7540]. AEs will be compared by [CONTACT_7541] -squared test 
or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, in the safety analysis set.  
 
9.2 Sample  size justification  
Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled.  
 
Assuming  1:[ADDRESS_6846] at the alpha=0.[ZIP_CODE] level  of 
significance for the final analysis,  120 patients  (60 per arm)  events will provide 80% power to detect 
an effect  size of 0.[ADDRESS_6847]. This leaves  alpha=0.[ZIP_CODE] to check  for overwhelming 
efficacy after 50% of participants have completed 24 hours of follow-up. 
 
9.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Summary  statistics  will be provided per treatment group for demographic (e.g., age, height, weight, 
body mass index [BMI],  race,  gender) and other  initial  subject  characteristics  (e.g., medical  history,  

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  04 DEC  2020  
Confidential  Page  31 of 42  
 concomitant diseases) will be provided per treatment group and for the total group. The ITT 
population will be used for the summaries. 
 
9.4 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be defined  for the study:  
The intent- to-treat (ITT)  population will include all randomized patients.  Patients  will be analyzed 
according to their assigned treatment arm. All efficacy analyses will be completed in the ITT population.  
 
The safety population will include all patients who receive study treatment. Patients will be analyzed  according to actual  treatment received.  All safety  analyses will be completed  in the safety 
population.  
 
9.5 Stratification,  Subgroup Analysis and Pooled Analysis  
Following consent, those subjects meeting  all entry  criteria  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio 
Treatment Arm: camostat mesilate + SOC  
Control Arm: placebo  + SOC 
Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_654] (>=50  and <50 years old) and sex.  
Members of the same  household may participate  in the study as long as the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are met. Because this is a double- blind, placebo- controlled trial, subjects from the same 
household will be randomized just as any other subject. 
 
9.6 Efficacy  Endpoint  Analysis  
 
9.7 Descriptive analyses  
Descriptive statistics (proportions for categorical variables, means, medians, standard deviations and interquartile ranges for continuous variables) will be reported for all key patient variables, including baseline and demographic characteristics, use of  medications, compliance, and study 
completion status. Data that are missing on key patient characteristics and the outcome will be 
fully  described,  including  any patterns of missingness (i.e., any relationships  between  missingness 
of a variable and patient characteristics).  
 
A CONSORT diagram displaying the number of patients screened, eligible, and consented along 
with reasons for ineligibility will be provided. Graphical tools such as histograms, boxplots, and 
scatterplots will be created to assess quali ty of data and to display patterns over time. 
 
9.8 Primary efficacy analysis  
To address our primary  objective, the AUC  SARS -CoV2  viral RNA  levels during follow -up will 
be estimated using the linear trapezoidal method, and mean AUC levels compared between groups using  a linear  regression  model  regressing  log(AUC)  on treatment  arm, site, age, and sex. 
If more than 3 sites are included to address the objectives, we will employ a mixed effects 

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  [ADDRESS_6848] will be performed at the two-sided  alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_6849] ratio for shedding cessation will be estimated, along with its 95% confidence interval, from a Cox proportional hazards model. If the proportional hazards assumption is not met, we will consider an extended Cox model that relaxes the proportional hazards assumption 
 
The distribution of shedding cessation will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, and 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be presented for each treatment arm. Time to shedding cessation at the 
end of the study period along with 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment arm. 
 
The distribution of time to resolution of symptoms will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method, and Kaplan- Meier curves will be presented for each treatment arm. Time to resolution of 
symptoms  at the end of the study period along with 95% confidence intervals  will be presented  for 
each treatment arm. The hazard ratio for resolution of symptoms will be estimated, along with its 95% confidence intervals,  from a Cox proportional hazards model.  Time  to resolution  of symptoms 
will be determined by [CONTACT_7555] (see Appendix A2). Resolution of symptoms 
requires that symptoms  are mild or absent  for at least 24 hours. The analysis of symptom resolution 
will be conducted on the symptomatic ITT population, i.e. participants who report moderate or severe  symptoms  at baseline.  These analyses will be repeated  in a second analysis considering only 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], i.e. fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, and nasal congestion/runny nose. This analysis will be performed on the subset of patients who report moderate or severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_7524].  
 
The number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department visits, incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], deaths, and proportions of subjects alive, not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7525], with 95% confidence intervals. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7526], E CMO, non- invasive ventilation, or high-flow oxygen 
 
Our analyses will use multiple imputation methods that assume data are missing at random by [CONTACT_7556], treatment assignment, and reasons for missingness in the 
imputation model. This approach will be applied to any analysis involving endpoints or key 
variables where any missing data occurs in order to adhere to the ITT principle. Assumptions regarding missingness will be addressed in sensitivity analyses. 
 
9.10 Safety  Analysis  

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  [ADDRESS_6850] or Fisher’s exact test, as 
appropriate, in the safety analysis set.  
 
The original exact terms in the electronic data capture (EDC) system used by [CONTACT_7557]-19 will be fully  described  and coded according to the 
Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA).  Treatment -emergent AEs will be defined 
as those occurring coincident with start of treatment and through [ADDRESS_6851]  of the DSMC meetings,  including interim  results;  these will be available 
for review when the trial is complete. The DSMC will be a separate entity from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The independence of the DSMC is intended to control the sharing of 
important comparative information and to protect the integrity of the clinical trial from adverse 
impact resulting from access to trial information.  DSMC members will be external to Stanford 
University, will not participate in the study as investigators, and will not have conflicts of  
interest regarding the study or the investigational product. The composition of the DSMC will 
include at minimum:  
 
• DSMC Chair,  having experience and expertise  in clinical  trials  
• Scientist  with expertise  in viral infectious diseases.  
• Biostatistician  with expertise  in clinical  trials.  

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  [ADDRESS_6852] additions and other modifications to this information on a one‑time or 
continuing basis. This information will consist of two parts: (1) information on study progress 
such as accrual, baseline characteristics, and other general information on study status and (2) any confidential data on study outcomes, including safety  data.  A formal  report from  the DSMC 
should be supplied to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 3 days of each meeting. Each report should conclude with a recommendation  to continue or to terminate  the study. This recommendation should be made  by 
[CONTACT_7558]. A recommendation to terminate the study should be transmitted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7527], by [CONTACT_7559]. In the 
event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within the 
regular DSMC report.  
 
10.2 Interim  Analysis  
An interim  analysis for safety and overwhelming efficacy will be performed once 50% of patients 
have 24 hours of follow-up complete.  The DSMC will meet  within a week  after 50% enrollment is 
reached to review the safety data collected within the first [ADDRESS_6853]  blood count labs collected  at day 5 to be available  in approximately 
25% of patients at the time of the DSMC review.  
 
The DSMC will also review the efficacy data on all randomized participants at this meeting. The 
interim efficacy analysis will use the same methods as are planned for the final analysis using the ITT analysis.  Based  on the results  of the interim  analysis,  the DSMC  will either  recommend  to the 
sponsor to terminate the study for overwhelming efficacy (p<0.[ZIP_CODE] at the interim analysis), terminate the study for safety concerns, modify the study, or continue the study as planned. No formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7528]. 
 
[ADDRESS_6854] all data collected on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) provided for that purpose. For this study, REDCAP cloud will be the eCRF. The site will be suitably trained  on the use of the eCRF  and appropriate site personnel will be provided electronic 
signatures.  

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  [ADDRESS_6855] all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. Any data,  specimens,  forms,  reports,  and other records that leave the site 
will be identified only by a subject identification number to maintain confidentiality.  
The Investigator must  maintain  adequate and accurate  records  to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verifi ed. These documents include 
Investigators’  Study Files  and original subject clinical  source documents generated  at the study site. 
The term “original” means the first recording of the data.  
The Investigator will ensure the site master files are maintained,  including the study protocol and 
its amendments,  IRB and regulatory  approvals with associated  correspondence, informed consents, 
study drug records, staff curriculum vitae, all correspondence, and other appropriate documents. 
Subject clinical source documents may include, but are not limited to, subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic 
records,  physicians’  and nurses’  notes,  appointment books, laboratory  reports,  ECGs,  radiographs, 
and consultant letters.  The Investigator must  assure that all original  source documents are available 
to support monitoring activities. 
 
11.3 Monitoring  
Due to the restrictions imposed on clinical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7529] -19 pandemic, all 
monitoring of this study will be conducted remotely. Monitors will work with the Study Coordinator at each site to determine times for “joint” remote monitoring – meaning that the 
monitor and the SC will review data together over the telephone. 
Remote monitoring will be conducted according to the applicable ICH and GCP guidelines t o 
ensure protocol adherence, quality of data, drug accountability, compliance with regulatory 
requirements and continued adequacy  of the investigational site and its facilities.  The Investigator 
will cooperate in the monitoring process by [CONTACT_7560], source documents and other necessary  documents at the time of remote  monitoring  and by [CONTACT_7561]/her attention by [CONTACT_7562]. 
 
11.4 Audit  
ICH guidelines for GCP require independent inspection of clinical program activities. Such 
inspections may be performed  at any time  - before, during and/or after the study. The Investigator  

IND  COPS -2003  Version  4.0/Date  04 DEC  2020  
Confidential  Page  36 of 42  
 and study staff are responsible for main taining the site master file containing all study -related 
regulatory  documentation as outlined by [CONTACT_7563], its designees,  and/or regulatory  agencies.  The Investigator understands and agrees 
to give access to the necessary documentation and files.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_6856] two years following the 
date of an approved marketing application [21 CFR 312.62(c)]; or at leas t three years from the 
formal  discontinuation of camostat  mesilate development; or seven  years  from  the end of the study, 
whichever is longer. All local laws regarding retention of records must also be followed.  Study 
sites are required  to retain  all records until written  notification  allowing  destruction  is received  from 
the Sponsor. 
 
12 ETHICS  
12.1 Ethics  Committee  
A properly constituted, valid IRB/IEC must review the treatment plan and procedures, the Investigator’s informed consent document, and related subject information. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all aspects of institutional rev iew are conducted in accordance 
with current regulations governing the jurisdiction where the study is conducted. The Sponsor (or designee) must receive a letter documenting IRB/IEC approval that specifically identifies the title of the treatment plan, subject information sheet, and ICF. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_6857]/representative 
and the Investigator (or designee), must be given to the subject/representative. Confirmation of a subject’s informed consent must also be documented in the subject’s medical record prior to any treatment with camostat mesilate.  
Each consent form should contain an authorization allowing the Investigator and the Sponsor (or designee) to use and disclose protected health information (PHI) (i.e., subject -identifiable health 
information) in compliance with local law. The signed consent form will be retained with the treatment records.  
 
13 GENERAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Discontinuation  of the Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason.

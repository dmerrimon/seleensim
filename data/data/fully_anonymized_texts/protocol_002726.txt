1.Background 
Osteoarthritis (OA), specifically involving the knee, is one of the most common causes of human disease1 
and can lead to significant pain and functional decline2.  A potential element of OA includes degenerative 
tears of the knee meniscus and/or chondropathy, both of which involve destabilization from mechanical 
or biological issues3. 
Cortisone injections are commonly used to temporarily relieve inflammation and pain associated with  
osteoarthritis.  The response or effect of the injection can vary, depending on the stage of OA.4  Advanced 
OA where little cartilage remains may not provide enough joint space for the injection to be effective.  
Cortisone  injections  can  also  potentially  cause  an  adverse  reaction  in  certain  patient  populations,  
particularly patients with diabetes who may experience a significant increase in blood sugar after a  
cortisone injection.5  
Alternatives to cortisone injections include viscosupplementation, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections  
and stem-cell therapy.  One form of therapy that has shown promising results with little reported on in  
literature is amniotic tissue matrices, to include BioDRestoreTM Elemental Tissue Matrix.  BioDRestore is  
a ”morselized, flowable tissue allograft derived from amniotic tissues.  Amniotic tissues have been shown  
to support soft tissue repair, reduce inflammation and minimize scar tissue formation”. 6,7 
This study will compare corticosteroid injection to BioDRestore injection in patients with significant  
(Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3-4) knee osteoarthritis.  Our hypothesis is that BioDRestore will result in  
better outcomes than corticosteroid when injected intra-articularly in patients with knee OA.
2.Study Endpoints
Primary Endpoint
Visual Analog Score (VAS) , VR-12, Lysholm, SANE  and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS) at the 6-week, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month post-injection time 
periods.
Secondary Endpoints
Inflammatory markers at 6-months post-injection.
3.Subject Recruitment and Screening
Screening
Patients who present with osteoarthritis of the knee and are recommended for a knee  
injection will be screened for inclusion into the study. Following discussion of the  
study between the patient and the treating physician, the patient will be given the  
opportunity to move forward with the informed consent process. 
    Enrollment
The subject will be considered enrolled once voluntary informed consent has been  
given, and the form has been signed and dated by [CONTACT_213246].  
    Randomization
Subjects will be randomized to a treatment arm (corticosteroid or BioDRestore injection)  
using a 1:[ADDRESS_255785]  
will be assigned through the study database.

Blinding
Study subjects and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignment for the 
duration of the study to reduce the risk of bias.  The research coordinator will provide the 
randomization to the investigator’s medical assistant (MA) prior to treatment in order for 
the MA to assist with preparation of the injection.

3.3.Withdrawal of Subjects from Study
  
Voluntary Withdrawal by [CONTACT_213248].  
If a subject withdraws from the study, the investigator will make all reasonable efforts to  
determine the reason for the subject’s withdrawal and will document the reason on the  
applicable form and in the patient’s medical record. After a subject withdraws from the  
study, no effort will be made to replace or follow the subject.  However, the subject will  
still be offered clinical management of their knee condition.
   Withdrawal by [CONTACT_213249], including but  
not limited to the following:
Occurrence of a serious adverse event
Investigator’s discretion to withdraw subject for safety reasons
Subject noncompliance with visits and/or assessments
Subject is lost to follow-up (as defined below)
5JAN2017  Page [ADDRESS_255787]’s source documentation:
At least [ADDRESS_255788] are not returned
A letter is sent to the subject’s last known address and the subject does not reply after  
[ADDRESS_255789] obtain written and dated approval of the informed consent  
form.  Subjects will receive a copy of the initial signed and dated informed consent form prior to the  
subjects’ participation in the trial and any revised informed consent forms during the duration of the trial.
The subject must sign and date the consent form in the presence of the investigator, who must sign  
and date the consent form in the presence of the subject.  The communications with the subject  
regarding informed consent process (initial and subsequent) should be documented in the medical record.
5.Study Procedures
Study Assessments
Visit 1- Baseline Assessment
The following information will be collected at the time of enrollment:
Informed Consent  
Medical History & Demographics  
Patient Outcomes  :  Subject to complete VAS, VR-12, KOOS, Lysholm and SANE prior to 
injection. 
Range of Motion Assessment: Measurement taken using goniometer.  
Visit 2- Randomization & Procedure
Inclusion/Exclusion review
Randomization
Procedure:    For patients with current knee effusion, the investigator will drain the effusion 
prior to the injection. For subjects that do not exhibit any signs of knee effusion, the 
investigator will proceed with the injection. Study subjects will be randomized to receive a 
cortisone or BioDRestore injection.  Subjects will be blinded to the assignment.  Prior to 
the injection, the area will be prepared with sterile solution and numbing agent.  Next, an 
injection of one of the following treatments, dependent on randomization, will be injected 
into the articular space of the knee:
-2 cc of 40 mg/ml Kenalog with 3 cc of saline
-2 cc BioDRestore  with 3 cc of saline 
Knee arthrocentesis (for procedure, see below under “Follow-up Visits”): The study doctor  
will attempt to perform a knee aspi[INVESTIGATOR_213238] a delta value for the assay.
Follow-Up Visits (6WK, 3M, 6M, 12M)
The following information will be collected at each follow-up visit:

Patient Outcomes  :  Subject to complete VAS, VR-12, KOOS, Lysholm, and SANE scales
6-month only, subject will return to the clinic for the following  :  
Range of motion assessment
Knee arthrocentesis (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]): The area will first be prepared with sterile  
solution  and  numbing  agent.  Using  a  10-mL  syringe,  obtain  at  least  
0.25mL of synovial fluid via a parapatellar approach. A knee aspi[INVESTIGATOR_213239].  Upon  completion,  the  syringe  will  be  
labeled  and  transported  to  the  Clemson  Bioengineering  Laboratory  of  
Orthopaedic Tissue Regeneration & Orthobiologics lab for analysis. 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_213240]:  Enzyme  linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  will be  
performed on synovial fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_213241] [ADDRESS_255790]-injection to determine if there are quantitative differences in  
soluble  mediators  and  products  of  osteoarthritis.   Briefly,  synovial  fluid  
samples will be evaluated in duplicate for inflammatory (interleukin-1 beta;  
IL-1β  and  tumor  necrosis  factor-alpha;  TNF-α),  anti-inflammatory  
(interleukin-[ADDRESS_255791];  IL-1RA  and  interleukin-10;  IL-10),  pain  
(prostaglandin-E2;  PGE 2)  and  soluble  signals  which  indicate  cartilage  
damage (S100A8 and S100A9 proteins, respectively).  
Briefly,  frozen  (-80oC)  samples  will  be  thawed  and  analyzed  using  a  
bicinchoninic  acid  assay  (BCA)  to  normalize  for  total  protein  content.  
Samples will be diluted accordingly using calibrator diluent supplied with  
ELISA kits.  ELISA will be performed according to manufacturer’s protocols  
and well plates will be analyzed optically on a µ-Quant microplate reader.  
Concentrations will be determined using a standard curved developed from  
known  concentrations  of  supplied  analyte.   Experimental  sample  analyte  
concentrations  (ng/ml)  will  be  plotted  on  histograms  and  group  mean  
concentrations ± standard deviation will be calculated for each experimental  
group.    
12-month only, subject will return to the clinic for the following  :  
oRange of motion assessment
oRadiographs of affected knee
Allowed Concomitant Medications and Prohibited Treatments
oConcomitant Medications:  Patients are allowed acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen 
for the first 6 months following treatment.  
oProhibited Treatments: Oral steroids, steroid injections and Viscosupplementation 
are not permitted for the first 6 months of the study in the treated knee.
6.Risk Analysis

Potential Benefits
Participation in this study may offer no benefit to subjects. However, it is possible that  
the use of BioDRestore will result in better outcomes than corticosteroid when injected  
intra-articularly in patients with knee OA.
Study subjects will receive a $50 stipend for each study visit for a total of $[ADDRESS_255792] a causal relationship with the device.  An adverse event can therefore be  
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding or an  
abnormal radiographic finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use  
of study device, whether or not related to the study device.  The following are specific  
definitions of adverse events:
Adverse Event (AE)  — any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, regardless if there  
is a relationship between the AE and the device. 
Adverse Reaction (AR) - The FDA requires, per 21CFR 1271.350(a), the reporting of certain 
adverse reactions related to implantation, transplantation, infusion or transfer of an HCT/P.  For 
tissue products, an Adverse Reaction is any unintended response, including a communicable 
disease, in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a human tissue or cell product implantation or transplantation.  An 
Adverse Reaction is considered serious (SAR) if it meets the criteria of a Serious Adverse Event 
(see below).
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)   an adverse event that:
leads to a death
leads to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that results in a life-
threatening illness or injury
results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function
requires in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to  
body structure or a body function
results in congenital anomaly/birth defect
Treatment for Adverse Events
In the event of an adverse event, the investigator and/or other professional personnel in  
attendance  will  provide  whatever  appropriate  medical  treatment  is  indicated  for  the  
problem. 
Documentation of Adverse Events
All adverse events will be documented in the source documentation.   Beginning after the  
study  procedure  has  taken  place,  all  AE’s,  including  those  measured,  observed  or  
volunteered, will be recorded on the applicable case report form.  The investigator will  
review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, or diagnostic reports)  
5JAN2017  Page [ADDRESS_255793]  all  relevant  
information regarding an AE onto the study CRF. 
The  investigator  will  attempt  to  establish  a  diagnosis  of  the  event  based  on  signs,  
symptoms,  and/or other  clinical information.  In  such cases, the diagnosis should be  
documented as the AE and not the individual signs and symptoms.
When reporting an AE, the investigator will evaluate the event for duration, intensity,  
relationship and outcome.
Examples of an AE:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition.
Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.
A new condition detected or diagnosed after study device administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.
Pre- or post-procedure events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated 
procedures (e.g., invasive protocol-defined procedures, modification of a 
subject’s previous treatment regimen).
An AE Does NOT Include:
Medical or surgical procedures. The medical condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145285].
Day to day fluctuations of pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected 
at the start of the study that do not worsen.
The condition/indication being studied or expected progression, signs, or 
symptoms of the condition/indication being studied unless more severe than 
expected for the subject’s condition.
Post-operative findings of swelling or pain within two (2) weeks of the initial 
procedure, unless deemed by [CONTACT_213250].
Follow-Up of Adverse Events
After the initial AE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject  
until the event resolves. All AEs documented at a previous visit that are designated as  
ongoing will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.
Adverse events will be followed until resolution, until no further changes in the event are  
expected (i.e. the point at which a subject experiencing a critical adverse event is treated  
successfully and stabilized even though he/she may continue to experience lingering  
sequelae that may never resolve), until the subject is lost to follow-up, or until it is agreed  
that further follow-up of the event is not warranted (e.g. non-serious, study therapy  
unrelated, mild or moderate adverse events ongoing at the subject’s final study visit). 
8.Reporting of Adverse Events
Investigator Adverse Event Reports
5JAN2017  Page [ADDRESS_255794] be reported by  
[CONTACT_213251], but no later than ten (10) working days  
after learning of the event.  The investigator must submit a detailed report that will  
identify the description of symptoms, classification of the event, date of onset, severity,  
treatment, and outcome.  Supporting medical records may be obtained as an adjunct to an  
adverse event report and placed in the subject’s study file.
All  AEs  will  be  categorized  as  mild,  moderate  or  severe  based  on  the  following  
definitions:
Mild:  The subject is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated.  The  
event is of little concern to the subject and/or little clinical significance.  The event is not  
expected to have any effect on the subject’s overall health or wellbeing.
Moderate:  The subject has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change in  
usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the subject’s health or wellbeing and  
may require medical intervention and/or close follow-up.
Severe:  The adverse event interferes considerably with the subject’s usual activities.  The  
event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the subject’s  
health or wellbeing.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or close  
follow-up and may be incapacitating or life threatening.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213242].  
Should an AR or SAE occur, an investigator must submit to DermaSciences and to the reviewing IRB a  
report of the event as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_255795] per FDA and/or IRB requests.
9.Source Documentation
Investigators are responsible for obtaining and maintaining complete subject health information in the  
medical record for each subject and each assessment in the protocol (source documents). Source  
documents include all information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_213243], observations or other activities in the study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation  
of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinic and office  
charts,  memoranda,  dispensing  records,  subject  questionnaires,  clinic  evaluation  transcriptions,  
operative notes, x-rays, radiology reports, blood collection and shipment records, research subject  
files, etc.) 
10.Disclosure of Data and Data Security
Data Security and Confidentiality
The clinical data obtained in this study will be kept private.  In any sort of published  
report, there will be no identifying information. Records for this study may be reviewed

records applicable to involvement in this study.
Participating subjects will be asked to sign a consent form that includes an authorization  
to  use  and/or  disclose  personal  health  information.   Subjects  are  free  to  refuse  
authorization to transfer personal information.  If the subject chooses not to agree to this  
authorization, the subject is not eligible to participate in the study.  Personal information  
(including sensitive personal health information, such as medical history) if relevant to  
the study will be reviewed, collected in a computer database, stored in electronic or  
manual  files,  audited,  and  /  or  otherwise  processed  by  [CONTACT_11168],  regulatory  
agencies, and other persons and/or agencies as required by [CONTACT_213252].
11.Statistical Procedures
      11.1 Sample Size Estimate
To determine sample size, we powered the study (a-priori) for the primary outcome measures of VAS,  
VR-12, KOOS, Lysholm, and SANE scales at baseline, 6-week, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month post-
injection time periods.  Assuming normal distributions among the 2 independent groups’ [ADDRESS_255796] size of 0.20 (small) based on between group  
differences  we  constructed  a  sample  size  estimation  using  a  Multivariate  Analysis  of  Variance  
(MANOVA). Measuring global effects, with an expected 80% power, and a standard error of probability  
of 0.05, we estimate the need for a minimum sample size of 70 for statistical significance (~35 per group).  
To account for a 20% drop-out rate, a sample size of 84 subjects will be recruited.  We will employ  
intention to treat and a chains equation, multiple imputation method in which we will assign predictor,  
structural and impute variables. Further, we will not oversample characteristics within each group for  
drop-outs. 
11.2Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe both groups at baseline. Appropriate tests of differences will  
be used to compare baseline differences in descriptive statistics, pain, range of motion, etc., between the  
two groups (e.g., t-tests and chi-square). Adverse events, including severity of these events will be  
captured and compared between the two groups. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will  
be used to measure differences between the targeted outcome measure at each of the given timepoints  
(baseline,  6-week,  3-month,  6-month,  and  12-months  post-injection  time  periods).  A  MANOVA  
investigates the effects of a categorical predictive variable (groups) on 2 or more continuous outcomes,  
which are correlated and represented by a vector of dependent variables.  For all analyses, a p value of  
<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

5.2 Exclusion Criteria •Updated Table 2 Prohibited 
Medications Before Start of Study 
Treatment.
•Removed Gilbert’s disease.
•Added hereditary fructose intolerance.
•Removed use of CPAP/BPAP as an 
exclusion criterion.•To align the allowed and prohibited medications 
with the most recent approved product labeling.
•Current approved product labeling allows 
posaconazole to be given to patients with Gilbert’s 
disease.
•Approved product labeling recommends against the 
use of posaconazo le PFS in patients with hereditary 
fructose intolerance due to the presence of sucrose 
and sorbitol in the suspending vehicle that is 
admixed with the PFS powder.
•Allowance of CPAP/BPAP reflects the potential 
use of these modalities in patients with pulmon ary 
aspergillosis and respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448].

expanded in text.
•Updated text to outline the global 
clinical response seen in adolescents 
and adults.
•Updated Observed Global Clinical 
Response Table [ADDRESS_169770] 2 
rows.•To more clearly define global clinical response.
•To align with observed data in trials/literature as it 
relates to expected clinical response.
•Based upon data from the adult study (P069), the 
observed global clinical response rates in 
participants with invasive aspergillosis after 12 
weeks of therapy are expected to be in the range of 
40%, thus rates higher than 60% have been 
removed from Table 9.
8.9.1 Screening •Clarified text to say that informed 
consent/assent must be obtained 
befor e any study -specific procedures 
are performed other than those 
procedures conducted for the purpose 
of routine clinical care.

to the list of local laboratory tests.•The text related to informed consent was modified 
to clarify the timeframe in which study -specific 
procedures may be obtained relative to the signing 
of the informed consent/assent.
•There was a clarification as to the source of 
imaging and mycology testing to indicate that local 
testing results would be used. T hese tests will be 
conducted to support the disease diagnosis and 
classification of possible, probable, or proven 
invasive aspergillosis .
[IP_ADDRESS] End of Treatment 
(EOT) VisitsClarified that participants who withdraw 
consent for participation or who are 
withdrawn from the study for any reason 
should complete both the EOT Visit and

2 INTRODUCTION
2.1 Study Rationale
As the number of immunocompromised patients , both adult and pediatric, continue sto 
increase , IFIs , including IA ,play a significant role in the morbidity and mortality seen in this 
population . There continues to be a need for the development of effective treatment options,
particularly in the pediat ric population for whom there are limited clinical study data 
detailing the treatment of IA. Recent advances in the adult population include the approval of 
POS in the US, Europe an Union ,and other countries for the primary treatment of IA [E.U. 
Summary of Product Characteristics 2022] [U.S. Prescribing Information 2022] . These
approval swere based upon the completion of a prospective, randomized, double -blind study 
that showed the safety and efficacy of P OS IV and tablet for the treatment of IA in 
adolescents and adults [Maertens, J. A., et al 2021] .
Invasive aspergillosis occurs in pediatric (and adult) population sthat are 
immunocompromised due to various pathologic and other factors , eg, malignancy, solid 
organ transplant or HSCT , primary immunodeficiency . The incidence rates of IAin 
high -risk patients vary by [CONTACT_148184] , in some instances, by [CONTACT_148185].
In children, IA is associated with significant increases in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148157]. Analyses of data from several major US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148158] 437/100,000 
(0.4%) [Pana, Z. D., et al 2017] , and mortality rates in children with IA between 18% and 
37% [Burgos, A., et al 2008] .
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_148159], IA infections in immunocompromised pediatric patients 
have been understudied. To date, pediatric IA treatment options have been extrapolated from 
IA adult studies and treatment options [Burgos, A., et al 2008] . Current guidelines [Patterson, 
T. F., et al 2016] for the management of IA in adult patients recommend voriconazole ( VOR )
for the primary treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, with posaconazole,
isavuconazole ,or lipid formulations of amphotericin B as alternative primary 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [Douglas, A. P., et al 2021] .However, guidelines are limited given the paucity of 
prospective study data in the pediatric pop ulation.
Asmall number of studies have provided data regarding recent treatment choices for 
pediatric patients diagnosed with IA. A 2017 trial of VOR inpediatric participants with IA 
demonstrated that safety and efficacy outcomes were consistent with pre vious findings in 
adult patients [Martin, J. M., et al 2017]. In this 2017 trial , 31 children ( 14with proven or 
probable infection) were enrolled and treated for IA for 6 to 12 weeks. A fter6 to 12 weeks of 
VOR therapy, the global clinical response was 64% . AEs were common, with 30/31 (97%) 
participants reporting one or more AEs , and 16/31 (52%) of the AEs were considered related 
to study therapy. In this trial, an association between hepatic AEs and higher V OR exposures 
was noted, although due to the small sample size, data interpretation was limited. Overall, 
48% of participants treated with VOR discontinued therapy early. These results indicate the 
need to identify alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_148160] e fficacious and/or better tolerated .

POS is a highly active triazole with potential advantages in terms of tolerability and drug 
interactions. POS (IV, PFS, and tablet formulations) has been recently approved for use in 
children 2 to <18 years of age for the salvage treatment and the prophylaxis of IFIs.This 
approval was based on data from a prospective PK and safety study that evaluated POS IV 
and PFS in children 2 to 17years of age who were at high risk of an invasive fungal infection
[Groll, A. H., et al 2020] .
The use of newer formulations of POS (PFS, tablet ,and IV) provide shigher POS 
concentrations in pediatric patients than the oral suspension formulation and support sthe use 
of the IV formulation in pediatric patients who are unable to tolerate oral dosing .As the 
newer IV, tablet, and PFS formulations of POS achieve higher POS exposures, the newer 
formulations have the potential for improve d clinical effectiveness.
As immunocompromised pediatric patients are at risk for IA, it is appropriate to study the 
efficacy and safety of POS IV and oral formulations (PFS and tablets) forthe primary 
treatment of IA in children. This trialevaluates safety, efficacy, and PK of PO S IV and oral 
formulations (PFS and tablets) in pediatric participants 2 to <[ADDRESS_169802] labeling for detailed background information on 
posaconazole ( MK-5592, POS) .
2.2.[ADDRESS_169803]- spectrum triazole antifungal compound approved for the prophylaxis and 
salvage treatment of IFIsin pediatric patients 2 to <18 years of age . POS is also approved for 
the primary treatment of IAas well as prophylaxis and salvage treatment of IFIs in 
adolescents and adults. The a pproved labe ling of indications and patient populations vary by 
[CONTACT_1606]. Current ly approved POS formulations include an IV solution and 3oral 
formulations (a pre-mixed liquid suspension, a powder for suspension to be mixed in a 
suspending vehicle, and a delayed -release tablet ). The powder for suspension and the
delayed -release gastric tablet formulation sovercome limitations in the oral bioavailability of 
the or al suspension ,allowing for once -daily dosing and ,as such ,arepreferred oral 
formulations . The oral PFS formulation consists of the same delayed -release compound as 
the tablet in a formulation that allows for more flexible weight -based dosing. A Phase 1B 
trial [ MK-5592- 097 ( P097 )]has provided PK and safety data for use of theIV and PFS 
formulations ,when given prophylactically to children at risk of IFI,thatsupport ed the 
approval of theseformulations in patients [ADDRESS_169804]: MK-5592  35

2.2.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies
There is1study ongoing, in addition to the current study, that is evaluating the use of POS in 
the pediatr ic population. In addition to this protocol, there is also another ongoing Phase 2 
clinical study of POS evaluation in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in pediatric 
patients 0 to 2 years of age (P127).
2.3 Benefit/Risk Asse ssment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit fro m
treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
POS has been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of IAand other IFIs in controlled as 
well as uncontrolled studies and in salvage therapy studies using the IV, tablet ,and oral 
suspension formulation inadults, and the IV and PFS formulation in pediatric participants
[Walsh, T. J., et al 2007] [Lehrnbecher, T., et al 2010] [Maertens, J. A., et al 2021] [Groll, A. 
H., et al 2020] . In addition, literature reports of POS IV and tablet have indicated the benefit 
of the POS when used to treat mold infections, including IA, in high -risk patients [Conant, 
M. M., et al 2015] [Jeong, W., et al 2016] .The most common toxicities that have been 
reported with POS include gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), fever, 
headache, and cough. The following risks have been identified in patients treated with POS 
per product labeli ng: hypersensitivity, hepatic toxicity, QTc prolongation, and drug 
interactions. Refer to current POS (NOXAFILTM)product labeling for additional 
information. The safety and efficacy of POS in children < 2years of agehas not been 
established . Current prod uct labeling indicate sapproval in children 2 yea rs of age and older 
and adults .
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this 
clinical trialmay be found in the accompanying IB and i nformed c onsent documents.

4 S TUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is anonrandomized, open- label , noncomparative, Phase 2,multi- sitetrialofPOS IV and 
oral formulations in pediatric participants aged 2 to <18 years with IA, as de fined by 2020 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group 
(EORTC/MSG) consensus definitions [Donnelly, J. P., et al 2020] .Individuals who meet the 
criteria for possible, probable, or proven IA will be enrolled.
After a screening period of up to 14 days, participants will be allocated to receive open -label 
POS study treatment .All participants will initiate treatment with thePOS IV formulation. 
After a minimum of 7 days on POS IV, and when the participant is considered clinically 
stable and able to take oral study treatment, per investigator judgment, participants may 
transition to oral study treatment with either the POS tablet formulation or the POS PFS 
formulation, based on their weight . The initial transition to POS oral formulation (either PFS 
or tablet) should occur no later than the Week [ADDRESS_169805] occur under medical 
supervision at the study site. After transitio ning to one of the oral POS formulations , 
additional transitions between oraland IV formulations are permitted as clinically indicated.
The planned total duration of study treatment across all formulations is 6to 12 weeks (42 to 
84days); the actual treatment duration for each participant will be based on the investigator ’s
clinical judgment. Participants should complete all study visits regardless of when they 
complete study treatment .Doses and additional details of study treatment are provided in 
Section 6.1.
Safety, efficacy, and PK assessments will be conducted throughout the treatment period ,and 
safety and efficacy assessments atthe follow -up visits, 14 (+2) and 28 (+2) days afte r the last 
dose of study treatment and at Day 114 (+7 days), as specified in Section 1.3. All participants 
will be follow ed for survival through Day 114. The trial’s objectives are stated in Section 3 
and include safety (primary objective) as well as effic acy, PK, and palatability and 
acceptability (secondary objectives).
Participants will participate in the trial for up to approximately 128 days:up to [ADDRESS_169806]: MK-5592  38
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 104-[ADDRESS_169807] 15 participants as 
characterized below in the FAS population (Section 9.5.1). Participants will be enrolled into 
the following age cohorts, which will enroll simultaneously:
•Age Cohort 1 (2 years to <12 years of age): approximately [ADDRESS_169808] 10 in the FAS population who transition to oral therapy ( PFS or tablet) 
for at least 7 days after the end of IV treatment with POS .
•Age Cohort 2 (12 years to <18 years of age): approximately [ADDRESS_169809] 5 in the FAS population who transition to oral therapy (PFS or tablet) for 
atleast [ADDRESS_169810], an independent ,external 
DMC will be established. Specific details regarding the DMC will be described in the DMC 
charter.
4.2 Scientific Rat ionale for Study Design
Asimmunocompromised pediatric patients (aged <18 years of age) are at high risk for IA, 
newer treatments are needed for pediatric patient populations. POS IV and tablet 
formulations have been studied in adolescents and adults for t he primary treatment of IA and 
have demonstrated efficacy and safety for this indication .Thus, it is reasonable to further
study the safety and efficacy of POS IV, tablet, and PFS in the primary treatment of IA in the 
pediatric population (see Section 2.2.3) .
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints
Efficacy is not a primary endpoint in this study. The efficacy endpoint (secondary) is the 
proportion of participants with a diagnosis of possible, probable ,or proven IA and a 
favorable global clinical response . This endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_148186] a nd study outcomes in clinical 
trials of invasive fungal diseases [Segal, B. H., et al 2008] and as presented in Section 8.2.1. 
The assessment of the efficacy endpoint in pediatric participants with a classification of 
possible, probable, or proven IAis similar to the efficacy population analyzed in the adult 
study (MK-5592-0 69P069) of IA. Additional efficacy endpoints are:
•An assessment of relapse of IA in participants with possible, probable ,or proven IA who 
have achieved a favorable global clinical response after completion of study treatment 
(secondary endpoint, Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
•An evaluation of all -cause mortality at Stud y Day 42 (exploratory endpoint, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). All -cause mortality at Study Day 42 as an efficacy endpoint has been 
considered an accepted endpoint for recent clinical studies of IA in adults and 
adolescents [Mar tin, J. M., et al 2017] . All-cause mortality will also be evaluated at Study 
Day 114.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 104-04
MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints
The safety of POS in this pediatric population will be primarily assessed by [CONTACT_148187] -related AEs. Other assessments may include ev aluation of all AEs (regardless of 
causality), as well as laboratory and ECG safety parameters.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Key PK parameters will be calculated from sparse plasma concentration data based on 
previously developed population PK models for each formulation in pediatric participants.
Exposure/response assessments will also be conducted, including an exploration of the 
relationship between PK parameters and measures of efficacy and safety.
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Endpoints
Palatability and acceptability pa rameters for the POS PFS formulation will be assessed in all 
participants who receive this formulation (refer to Section 8.3.5 for further details of the 
palatability assessment).
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparator/Placebo
This study is designed to obtain efficacy and safety information regarding the use of POS IV 
and oral formulations as primary treatment of IA in children ≥2 and <18 years of age . To 
obtain as much experience as possible with POS treatment in this trial, given the limited 
participan tpopulation, no comparator will be assessed. POS has previously been 
demonstrated to be efficacious in the primary treatment of IA in a double -blind comparative 
study of POS IV and tablet compared with VOR IV and oral formulations when given to 
adults and adolescents [Maertens, J. A., et al 2021] .
Given the high rate of mortality of IA among untreated patients , the use of a placebo 
treatment arm has not been considered.
4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 Starting Dose for This Study
All randomized participants will begin study dosing with the IV formulation of POS. The 
dose of 6 mg/kg /day for the IV formulation was chosen for this study based on the results of 
thePhase 1B PK and safety study of POS in children and adolescents (P097) as well as the 
approved dosing of POS IV for children 2 years of age and older . Participants will receive 
POS IV at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day BID on Day [ADDRESS_169811] 7 days and when clinically appropria te, participants can be switched to an oral 
form ulation. Participants weighing ≤40kg will transition to the PFS formulation. The dosing 
for the PFS formulation, shown in Table [ADDRESS_169812]: MK-5592  40
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 104-04
MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
specified in the protocol before implementation of this amendment. Participants weighing 
>40kg will transition to the tablet at a dose of [ADDRESS_169813] labelling for the treatment of IA.

17-<21kg 150mg (5 mL)
21-<26kg 180mg (6 mL)
26-<36kg 210mg (7 mL)
36-40kg 240mg (8 mL)
PFS= powder for delayed release oral suspension
4.3.2 Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Study
For a given participant, the maximum planned dose of POS is 300 mgper administration 
(administered BID on Day 1 and QD on subsequent days for a maximum of 84 days). 
Participants who weigh >40 kg will receive the maximum plann ed dose of 300 mg. The 
maximum total daily dosing established for this study reflects the approve ddose for POS 
solid oral tablet and POS IV solution formulations, which is 300 mgBID on Day 1 followed 
by 300 mg QD.
4.3.3 Rationale for Dose Interval and Study De sign
In this study, all participants will initiate treatment with IV POS and may transition to oral 
POS after a minimum of 7 days on IV study treatment and as clinically indicated. 
Participants who weigh > 40kg will transition to the tablet as the oral formulation ;
participants who weigh ≤ [ADDRESS_169814] been used to treat IA and other IFIs in controlled 
studies of IA as well as in uncontrolled studies a nd in salvage therapy studies [Walsh, T. J., 
et al 2007] [Lehrnbecher, T., et al 2010] [Conant, M. M., et al 2015] [Jeong, W., et al 2016]. 
Consistent with the POS (NOXAFIL) label , POS is ad ministered twice on the first day of 
study treatment and then QD for the duration of treatment.
The planned duration of study treatment is 6to 12 weeks ( 42 to 84 days); this aligns with 
current recommendations for the treatment of IA, which call for a min imum duration of 
treatment of 6 to 12 weeks [Patterson, T. F., et al 2016] .
In this study, participants with possible IA will begin study treatment before their diagnosis 
of IA is confirmed. Early initiation of antifungal treatment while the definitive diagnostic 
evaluation is in progress is recommended by [CONTACT_148188] [Patterson, T. F., et al 2016] .

6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storag e/Accountability
6.2.1 Dose Preparation
The rationale for the selection of doses to be used in this study is provided in Section 4.3, 
Justification for Dose.
The participant’s body weight at Day 1 will be used to calculate the dose of POS IV study 
treatment. Theparticipant’s body weight as measured within [ADDRESS_169825] day of 
oral POS treatment will be used to calculate all subsequent doses of oral POS : any participant 
whose weight is ≤40kg will transition to the PFS formulation; any participant whose weight 
is >40 kg will transition to the tablet formulation andwill receive 300 mgas 3 ×100-mg 
tablets. F or any subsequent switch from oral to IV formulation ,the IV dose will be calculate d
based on the participant’s weight before the initial switch to an oral formulation.
Instructions for preparation of the IV infusion and the PFS oral solution are found in the 
Pharmacy Manual. Instructions for administration of PFS will be provided to caregivers 
separately.
6.2.[ADDRESS_169826] be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manua l or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).

Antiretroviral Therapy Multiple As HIV protease inhibitors and NNRTIs are CYP3A4 
substrates, it is expected that POS will increase plasma 
levels of these antiretroviral agents. Participants should be 
carefully monitored for any occurrence of toxicity during 
the coadministration of POS and these agents.
NOTE: Coadministration of POS with atazanavir, 
efavirenz, fosamprenav ir, or ritonavir is not permitted 
during the treatment phase of the study.
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_148167] 200 mg orally once daily increased the AUC of 
midazolam by 83% following IV administration. Due to 
the inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_148196], an even 
greater effect of POS on the AUC of midazolam is 
expected following oral administration. Dose adjustments 
should be considered for all benzo diazepi[INVESTIGATOR_148168]3A4. POS interferes with the 
hepatic clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, 
may enhance the sedative effects of these agents. 
Therefore, these agents should not be used unless 
monitoring is provided for e xcessive sedation

related to calcium channel blockers is recommended 
during coadministration with POS. Dose adjustment of 
calcium channel blockers may be required.
Cardiac Glycosides Digoxin Administration of other azoles has been associated with 
increases in digoxin levels. Digoxin levels s hould be 
monitored when initiating or discontinuing POS treatment .

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
●Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
●Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
●The investigator is responsible for assuring that procedures are conducted by 
[CONTACT_148198]. Delegation of study site personnel responsibilities 
will be documented in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).
●All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
●Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before documented ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA .
●Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_88686]. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg , HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local 
regulations may require that additional informed consent , and assent if applicable, be 
obtained from the participant. In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed 
in accordance with those regulations.
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the trial, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 78.6 mLTable 12.
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with 
the samples.

8.3 Safety Assessments
Details regarding specific safety pr ocedures/assessments to be performed in this study are 
provided. The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of the study 
(from prestudy to poststudy visits), including approximate blood/tissue volumes 
drawn/collected by [CONTACT_82065] d by [CONTACT_148204], can be found in Appendix 2 .
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.3.1 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be conducted by [CONTACT_88696] (consistent with local requirements) as per institutional standard . The complete 
physical exam ination includes the following assessments: general appearance, head, eyes,
ears/nose/ throat, neck, lymph nodes, skin, lungs, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and 
neurologic evaluations. B reast, rectal, and genitourinary/pelvic exams should be performed 
when clinically indicated.
Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. Height measurements should be taken 
without shoes and be recorded to the nearest cm. Body weight at b aseline will be used to 
calculate the participant ’s dose for the IV treatment phase of the study. The participant ’s 
weight measured within [ADDRESS_169848]: MK-5592  67
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 104-[ADDRESS_169849] 0.1 kg.
A brief directed physical examination will be conducted by [CONTACT_148205] (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard at any other 
visit when clinically indicated.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
8.3.2 Vital Signs
•Vital signs will include heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature.
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
•Single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG machine that 
automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. 
Any clinically significant abnormality on study treatment must be followed until 
stabilization or return to baseline . Refer to Section 7.1 for QTc withdrawal criteria and 
additional QTc readings that may be necessary.
•For small participants whose size does not allow for a standard 12- lead ECG, a modified 
12-lead ECG may be obtained.
Note: When the collection of vital signs, ECGs, and PK samples coincide, the blood samples 
for PK determination should be collected first (so that the PK sam ples are collected on time), 
followed by [CONTACT_148206], and then the ECG. It is preferred that the ECG be performed at 
the same time each day (eg, morning) to reduce diurnal variation .
8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
•Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_169850] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
SoA for the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clini cally 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the case report form 
(CRF). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with t he 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_78259]'s condition.

recommendations:
•Ages 2 through 4 years: Completion by [CONTACT_43049] (parent/caregiver or health care 
provider) .
•Ages 5 through 13 years: Combined completion: the child participant should
complete the faces question and the observer should complete the remaining 
questions.
•Ages 14 through 17 years: Completion directly by [CONTACT_148207] .
Observer assessments should be based on what the parent/ legally acceptable represent ative/
caregiver/health care provider has observed directly during and after medication 
administration, including the participant’s facial expressions, behavior, and what the 
participant says. Only individuals who have directly observed the participant taking the study 
treatment should complete the assessment.
8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Reportable 
Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix [ADDRESS_169853]: MK-5592  69
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 104-04
MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
AE, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when 
appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenti ng, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators need to document if an AE and/or SAE was associated with a medication error, 
misuse, or abuse . 
Investigators remain responsible for following up AE, SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3.
The investigator, who is a qualified physician, will assess events that meet the definition of 
an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events with res pect to seriousness, 
intensity/toxicity and causality.
8.4.[ADDRESS_169854] be reported immediately to the Sponsor 
if the event is considered related to study intervention.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE sor SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other r eportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_169855]: MK-5592  70

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAE s,and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events. Open- ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAE s, and other reportable safety events,
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), 
cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3). In 
addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in
allocated participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in 
Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (wit hin 24 hours) by [CONTACT_88701] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a le gal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements .
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered adverse 
events, any pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously 
reported to the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the study are reportable to 
the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as

normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less 
than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by [CONTACT_13149] -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: This section reflects the handling of nons erious ECI. ECI events meeting SAE 
criteria are to be reported in the same manner as SAE. The purpose of the criteria is to 
specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for 
an underlying etiology. The study site g uidance for assessment and follow -up of these 
criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
In this study, an overdose is any dose higher than the protocol -specified dose as provided in

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.[ADDRESS_169878] for Clinical Trials
[COMPANY_006] Sharp &Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, [LOCATION_003] (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing ,and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations (including all applicable data protection regulations), and
International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP) ,and also in accordance with the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
[CONTACT_19481] (parties) employed for their execution (e .g., contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not app ly to investigator- initiated trials , which are not under the 
full control of M SD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pi[INVESTIGATOR_19354], clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SD
may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i .e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific
purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability 
to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Pr actice
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, 
08K3VC
PRODUCT: MK-5592  84
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 104-04
MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
scientific/research misc onduct or seri ous GCP -non-compliance is suspected, the issues are investigated. 
When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review 
committees notified .
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish theprimary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to p ublish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pi[INVESTIGATOR_26346] -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing ;in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by [CONTACT_19482].
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by [CONTACT_126558] (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III.Participant Protection
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics 
Comm ittee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_88708]/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.
The protocol, protocol am endment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial 
documents must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval.  
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compli ance with 
local and/or national regulations.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as altern atives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care.
All participation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtained . Participants may wit hdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
[CONTACT_2371], only the investigator, Sponsor ( or individuals acting on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory 
authorities will have access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by [CONTACT_2300].
D. Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by [CONTACT_63544] c ommittee.

MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
IV. Financial Considerations
A. Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challengi ng, additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, M SDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SD,and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by [CONTACT_19488] (e.g. , to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices .
V. Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to suppo rt these et hical and scientific standards .

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definitions of Medication Error, Misuse, and Abuse:
Medication Error
This is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to or has the potential to 
lead to harm to the patient.
Misuse
This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the terms of the product information.
Abuse
This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicin al 
product for a perceived psychological or physiological reward or desired non -therapeutic 
effect.
10.3.2 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study interve ntion, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
•NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
•NOTE: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, or protocol specified procedure whether investigationa l or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention) , manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by [CONTACT_63553].
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline ,considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.

•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reporte d using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
•Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer.
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that lead s to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the st art of the study that do not worsen.
•Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.
•Refe r to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_169886] medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
•The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.

MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686]
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19358] a pre -existing condition t hat has not 
worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
•This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, dia rrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•In offspring of participant taking the product rega rdless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatenin g or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63474] 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.
•Examples of suc h events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.

10.3.5 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE r ecording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.
•It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
•There may be instance s when copi[INVESTIGATOR_88650]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_19361].
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity
•An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
•The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) according to the NCI CTCAE , version 5.0. Any AE that changes 
CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_19362] /worksheets.
-Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clin ical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.
-Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
-Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL.
-Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated .
-Grade 5: Death related to AE.

Assessment of c ausality
●Did the Sponsor's product cause the adverse event?
●The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor's product caused the adverse event 
will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician.  The investigator’s 
signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality 
noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was 
done.  This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame.  
The criteria below are intended as referenc e guidelines to assist the investigator in 
assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test product and the adverse event 
based upon the available information
●The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Spons or's product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor's 
product caused the adverse event:
-Exposure:   Is there evidence that the participant was actua lly exposed to the 
Sponsor's product such as:  reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite 
in bodily specimen?
-Time Course:   Did the AE follow in a reasonabl e temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor's product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)?
-Likely Cause:   Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_19511], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors
-Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor's product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
◦If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
◦If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. 
◦If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_148174]'s product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study); or (4) Sponsor's 
product(s) is/are only used one time.)
-Rechallenge:   Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor's product in this study?
◦If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
◦If yes, this is a positive rechalle nge. 
◦If no, this is a negative rechallenge.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   104 -04  
MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study); or (3) Sponsor's 
product(s) is/are used only one time.)
NOTE:  IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS 
SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_26370]'S PRODUCT, 
OR IF RE -EXPOSURE TO THE SPONSOR'S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL 
POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE 
RECHALLENG E MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_148221], AND IF REQUIRED, THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW 
BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE.
●Consistency with Study treatment Profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with pr evious knowledge regarding the Sponsor's product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?
●The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by 
[CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician according to his/her best clin ical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
●Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor's product relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's pro duct relationship:
There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor's product.  The temporal sequence of the 
AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor's product is reasonable.  The 
AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_1034]'s product than by [CONTACT_148222]. 
-No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's product relationship:
Participant did not receive the Sponsor's product OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the Sponsor's product is not reasonable OR the AE 
is more likely explained by [CONTACT_26372]’s product.  (Also entered 
for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)
●For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and ha s provided an assessment of causality.
●There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an a ssessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
●The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.
●The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   104 -04  
MK-5592 -104-04FINAL PROTOCOL 02-SEP-2022
●For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, 
the investigator may attribute each adverse event causality to the combination regimen or 
to a single agent of the combination.  In general, causality attribution should be assigned 
to the combination regimen ( ie,to all agents in the regimen). However, causality 
attribution may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], there is 
sufficient data to support full attribution of the adverse event to the single agent.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_19514]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor w ithin 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.6 Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and o ther reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic d ata 
collection t ool
•The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
(EDC) tool.
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
◦Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by [CONTACT_756] (see next section).

•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transm ission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the SAE data collectio n tool sent by [CONTACT_19515].
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent) .

10.5 Appendix 5: Contraceptiv e Guidance
10.5.1 Definitions
Females of Childbearing Potential
A female is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below):
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolesc ents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Females in the following categories are not considered f emales of childbearing potential :
•Premenarchal
•Premenop ausal female with 1 of the following:
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
-A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.
◦A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in females not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_169887]:   MK-5592  103

10.5.2 Contraception Requirements
Contraceptives allowed during the study includea:
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Have Low User Dependency
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
•Progestogen -only subdermal contraceptive implantb,c
•IUSc,d
•IUD
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of 
the female of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm ha s been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be used. A spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 
days.
Note: Documentation of azoospermia can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical re cords, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Sexual Abstinence
•Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.
Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_148223].
If locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to those 
which inhibit ovulation.
Male condoms must be used in addi tion to hormonal contraception .
IUS is a progestin -releasing IUD .
Note: The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
-Periodic abstinence (calendar, symp tothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and LAM.
-Male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide.
-Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with frictio n).

Finding alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_500211].
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
group of medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in 
clinical studies. NSAIDs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of acute 
pain; however, current oral formulations of meloxicam are not suitable for the 
treatment of acute pain due to a relatively slow absorption. In contrast, an 
intravenous (IV) formulation of meloxicam has recently demonstrated efficacy 
in models of acute pain.
This formulation of meloxicam is being developed to provide a rapid absorption 
of meloxicam from an oral dose. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of this formulation of meloxicam in 
subjects with acute pain; however, it is anticipated to provide analgesia to these 
subjects due to the rapid absorption demonstrated in Study  
and the efficacy observed for a co-crystal of meloxicam (MECC-SA) that 
demonstrated efficacy in Study MECC-TBZ-2001. The efficacy dose-response 
profile of meloxicam is currently unknown, and the purpose of this study is to 
establish an understanding of the dose-response relationship for this formulation.
The dental pain model is considered an ideal model of post-surgical acute pain 
as it has high assay sensitivity and is predictive of efficacy in later stage models. 
It is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative care 
protocols can be standardized across patients. The dental surgical model has 
demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across a range of different 
pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942], more specifically, has 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 4 of 84

of meloxicam in subjects 
following dental surgery 
and to establish the

will be the summed pain 
intensity difference 
(SPID) over 0-24 hours 
for meloxicam vs. 
placebo for the modified

Methodology This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
dose-response study, randomizing and dosing approximately [ADDRESS_644187] had dental surgery (removal of ≥[ADDRESS_644188] molars) performed. 
Subjects will receive study drug on Day 1.
The study design is consistent with research design recommendations of the 
IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 6 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0 15 February 2022 ConfidentialClinical Trials) group for trials involving subjects with short-duration acute pain.
Subjects will attend screening at Visit 1, to occur within [ADDRESS_644189] the operation performed on Day 1 using appropriate local 
anesthesia and sedation (performed using nitrous oxide and a local injection of 
lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Subjects will also receive prophylactic antibiotics 
post-surgically.
Pain Intensity (PI) (using a 0-10-point numeric rating scale [NRS] where [ADDRESS_644190] pain imaginable) will be assessed during the [ADDRESS_644191] scores an NRS ≥5 and a rating of moderate or 
severe pain on a 4-point categorical pain rating scale (i.e., none, mild, moderate, 
severe) during this time they will be eligible for randomization (eligibility 
assessment). An additional PI [INVESTIGATOR_500212]; a subject will be dosed only if 
the NRS score of the second assessment is ≥5 (baseline assessment). 
Randomization will take place between eligibility and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_13699]. A 
diary/source document will be used to record the pain scores.
Subjects will be randomized to receive either meloxicam tablets (1.25 mg BID, 
5 mg BID, 15 mg BID) or placebo after the assessment of the subject’s 
eligibility pain score at Visit 2. Thus, randomization will take place between 
eligibility and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_13699].
Dosing of study medication must be within 15 minutes of the eligible PI [INVESTIGATOR_500213] (eligibility assessment) and immediately after the pre-dose PI [INVESTIGATOR_500213] (baseline assessment).
PI [INVESTIGATOR_103835] (NRS) will be measured at 15, 30, and [ADDRESS_644192] dose of study medication, 
as well as immediately before any rescue medication and/or at the time of early 
termination.
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be made at [ADDRESS_644193]-dose, rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, where 0-poor, 1-fair, 2-
good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent and/or at the time of early termination. 
The times to first perceptible relief and meaningful pain relief will be determined 
using the double-stopwatch technique. The time to onset of first perceptible 
relief (time that the first watch is stopped) is defined as the post-dose time at 
which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. The time to meaningful pain 
relief (time that the second watch is stopped) is defined as the post-dose time at 
which the subject begins to feel meaningful pain relief. If a subject takes rescue 
medication prior to recording perceptible or meaningful pain relief, the 
stopwatches will be collected, and no further assessments of these endpoints will 
be collected.
Rescue medication of  will be 
allowed at any time, but subjects will be encouraged to wait until at least 
 post-dose if possible. A PI [INVESTIGATOR_500214].
PK samples will be taken pre-dose and 15, 30, and [ADDRESS_644194] dose at Day 1.
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic following the 24-hour assessments; if 
the subject requires a longer duration of in-patient assessment due to reasons 
associated with the surgery, this is acceptable.
A final follow-up telephone call will occur approximately [ADDRESS_644195] will include those related to gastrointestinal 
(GI) AEs, particularly bleeds and those related to serious cardiovascular (CV) 
events.
Unless consent is withdrawn, subjects who prematurely terminate study drug 
will have discharge procedures performed at that time or at an early termination 
(ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible.
Study 
TreatmentTreatments to be received during the study will include one of the following 
treatment arms:
1. Meloxicam 1.25 mg BID.
2. Meloxicam 5 mg BID.
3. Meloxicam 15 mg BID
4. Placebo BID.
To maintain the blind due to differences in appearance between the tablets, 
subjects will receive in a double dummy design, three tablets when dosed (one 
that is representative of a 1.25 mg tablet, one that is representative of a 5 mg 
tablet and one that is representative of a 15 mg tablet). Due to the 
double-dummy design, neither the subject, nor the Investigator will know what 
treatment a subject receives. Per the clinic procedures, subjects will also be 
blindfolded during dosing.

Planned 
Number of 
SubjectsApproximately 108 subjects (N=27/treatment arm) dosed to give approximately 
100 evaluable subjects for the primary endpoint (N=25/treatment arm).
Statistical 
MethodsIn order to derive the required sample size for the primary estimand,  
for 10 mg 
BID, 15 mg BID and placebo reported from a previous meloxicam study 
conducted by [CONTACT_1034] (MECC-TBZ-2001 in dental pain). Simulations were

Note tha
t the expected standardized effect sizes (expected effect size divided by 
[CONTACT_66309]) are approximately  (15 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 
1.25 mg BID, respectively); therefore, the comparisons [ADDRESS_644204] approximately %, 
% and % power to declare statistical significance for standardized effect 
sizes of , respectively.
To analyze W6LOCF SPID 0-[ADDRESS_644205] errors, p-values and 95% CIs will be 
calculated. Standardized effect sizes will also be estimated from the E max model 
(effect sizes for each dose versus placebo divided by [CONTACT_500237] 95% confidence intervals. Baseline pain intensity score (PI) will be 
used as a covariate in the E max model. Baseline is defined as the pre-dosing PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_32005]. The numerical dose values will be 2.5, 10, 30, and 0 for 1.25 mg BID, 5 
mg BID, 15 mg BID, and placebo, respectively.
If the E max model fails to converge, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will 
be used to assess the difference between treatment groups. The ANCOVA model 
will include treatment as fixed effect and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_103840] a covariate. The 
difference between meloxicam and placebo will be estimated from the least 
squares means (LS means) along with the 95% CI and associated 2-sided p-
values. In addition, the standardized effect sizes for each dose will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_500238].
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for meloxicam (C max, AUC 0-2, AUC 0-4, 
AUC 0-8, AUC 0-12 and AUC 0-24) will also be calculated. The relationship between 
PK parameters and efficacy will explored graphically.

Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) group of 
medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activity in clinical 
studies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment 
of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis [7] and acute 
pain [8]; [9]. NSAIDs are currently recommended by [CONTACT_103886] [10] and have indications for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA); however, most recent treatment guidelines for RA have focused on disease 
modification rather than analgesia [11]; [12]. NSAIDs are considered generally safe for 
short-term use with the following exceptions: patients with NSAID-exacerbated respi[INVESTIGATOR_500223]-TFZ-2001 Page 26 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialdisease, patients with prior myocardial infarction who are receiving antithrombotic therapy, 
patients with asthma, and patients with a history of renal disease [13].
The apparent primary mechanism of action of meloxicam, and of other NSAIDs, is the 
reduction of prostaglandin (PG) production through its inhibitory activity against 
cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) [14]. Meloxicam is currently approved in oral 
formulations in the US as a treatment for chronic diseases: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pauciarticular and polyarticular course (at the 7.5 mg dose 
only in children that weigh ≥60 kg). An IV formulation of meloxicam is currently approved 
in the US for the management of moderate-severe pain. 
Meloxicam is available in tablet form; (MOBIC® [Boehringer Ingelheim] and various generic 
forms and QMIIZ® orally disintegrating tablets [Tersera Therapeutics]) and in capsule form 
(VIVLODEX® [Iroko Pharmaceuticals]). MOBIC is approved at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg once 
per day and VIVLODEX is approved at doses of 5 and 10 mg once per day. Meloxicam has 
been extensively studied in humans as MOBIC and VIVLODEX in chronic pain indications, 
including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Meloxicam has also been approved by [CONTACT_500239]® (Baudax Bio, Inc) at a dose of 30 mg for 
the management of moderate-severe pain.
Based on the demonstration that meloxicam is effective for the treatment of chronic pain such 
as osteoarthritis at doses of ≥7.5 mg/day and that this effect is mediated by [CONTACT_103888], a concentration of approximately 1090 ng/mL, which is similar to the steady 
state concentration of 7.5 mg meloxicam, would be considered sufficient for mediating an 
analgesic response [15]. Ex vivo assays performed on samples taken from subjects receiving 
7.[ADDRESS_644224] demonstrated an 83% inhibition of COX-2 [15].
Gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups 
across MOBIC trials, reflective of the safety profile of meloxicam. The most commonly 
reported AEs in both short-term and long-term studies of MOBIC in osteoarthritis are 
summarized in Table 3.

Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of

As discussed in the most recent specific Cochrane Review of meloxicam [16] and the general 
review of NSAIDs for the treatment of acute pain [8], current oral formulations of meloxicam 
(e.g., MOBIC and VIVLODEX) are not indicated for, nor are they suitable for, the treatment 
of acute pain due to the delayed absorption of the product. 
Meloxicam however, has demonstrated efficacy in a number of clinical studies using 
intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) formulations, including short-term studies in dental 
extraction [17]; [18] and post-bunionectomy surgery [19]; [20]. Some data are suggestive that 
IM meloxicam has a more rapid onset than oral meloxicam in rheumatoid arthritis pain [21] 
and sciatica [22]. Furthermore, a recently completed study (MECC-TBZ-2001, IND , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) demonstrated efficacy in a study in dental extraction for an oral co-crystal 
formulation of meloxicam: salicylic acid (MECC-SA). This study demonstrated that 
MECC-SA, at both doses (10 and 15 mg) and regimens (QD and BID) tested, was more 
effective than placebo at reducing subjects’ post-surgical dental pain (Table 5).

It is important to note that for these data using the W2LOCF approach, the rescue medication 
that subjects received (   
), with a recommended dosage of every 4-6 hours) was likely to still be exerting analgesic 
effects at the end of the 2-hour censoring period. In addition, the majority of subjects in each 
dose group received rescue medication within [ADDRESS_644227] of rescue 
medication use on a large number of subjects. While a clear dose-response relationship was 
not established for any individual endpoint, the overall results (including secondary endpoints 
such as time to perceptible pain relief and rescue medication use) indicated that 15 mg may 
be more effective than 10 mg, and that BID regimens may be more effective than QD 
regimens.

was approximately  than that of 15 mg MOBIC, the overall exposure (AUC) was 
 The combination of similar overall exposure with the anticipated acute use of this 
formulation of meloxicam means that use of 15 mg meloxicam is considered safe, especially 
as ANJESO (IV meloxicam) 30 mg has a reported C max of 7972.5 ng/mL and an AUC inf of 
121437.6 ng.hr/mL.

absorption of the drug. A rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103849] a similar overall exposure (and lower than 
that of IV meloxicam) to that of other oral meloxicam products the safety profile should be 
similar. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of this formulation of meloxicam in subjects with 
acute pain, however it is anticipated to provide analgesia to these subjects due to  
 demonstrated in . It is estimated that a 
15 mg dose of meloxicam would exceed within approximately  of 
dosing, therefore acute analgesia could be anticipated at or around this time. Lower doses of 
meloxicam may not exceed  and may not provide adequate analgesia; however, 
they are needed in this study to fully understand the dose-response profile of meloxicam.
As the meloxicam exposure data for this formulation of meloxicam is similar to MECC-SA it 
is appropriate to use the data from MECC-TBZ-[ADDRESS_644230]

5 mg BID would likely be  and 15 mg BID

The administration of meloxicam 15 mg BID should therefore be well tolerated.
As meloxicam will be administered under controlled conditions in a clinic-based study, the 
risks and benefits to individual subjects can be carefully assessed; rescue medication will be

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialavailable to subjects (whether taking active or placebo) if the pain associated with the 
surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
The use of placebo and low doses of meloxicam in the study is appropriate to ensure that any 
change from baseline in pain assessments related to the study drug can be adjusted for the 
‘placebo-response’ that is common in pain studies and for an exploration of the dose-response 
of meloxicam. All subjects will be allowed to use rescue medication if the pain associated 
with the surgical procedure is too great post-dose.

The dental surgical pain model has been in widespread use for over 50 years, is well 
characterized, and is frequently used to investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
analgesic molecules (onset/offset, dose response, and potency). Efficacy in the dental model 
is highly predictive of efficacy in later stage models and has a high assay sensitivity [24]. The

can be standardized across patients. 
The dental surgical pain model has demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across 
a range of different pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [24] and specifically has

would not be sufficient and that a 4-6 hour window would be a better balance of a). 
accounting for the analgesic effect of the rescue medication and b). not censoring a large 
amount of data in placebo or low doses of study medication. For this reason, a W6LOCF 
approach will be adopted for the primary analysis, with pre-specified sensitivity analyses of 
W4LOCF and W8LOCF also explored.
This study will specifically identify if meloxicam has efficacy in a model of acute 
post-operative pain and will enable the identification of the most appropriate dose of 
meloxicam to continue in development.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential4.2.3 Criteria for Study Drug Termination, Withdrawal from the Study and Study 
Termination
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to 
their future medical care by [CONTACT_500242].
Every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study. When available, a reason for not 
completing the study will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).
If, a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, due to any reason as provided in the 
below withdrawal criteria, the site should request the subject’s consent for being followed-up 
during further study visits to perform safety and efficacy assessments as per Table 1. 
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study prior to randomization under the following 
circumstances:
The subject withdraws consent.
The subject has a positive pregnancy test at Visit 2 (Day 1) or at any preceding point 
prior to this following Screening (Visit 1).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103850]/reinforcement, the subject shows persistent inadequate compliance 
with required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring 
while on study drug based on Investigator’s discretion.
The subject takes prohibited treatment presenting a safety concern to dosing with 
study drug.
If it is in the subject’s best interest based on decision of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59778]-Investigator e.g., due to occurrence of an AE and/or other findings considered to 
present a safety concern prior to dosing with study drug. Specifically, the following 
would mandate withdrawal:
oThe subject experiences a GI bleed or significant CV event prior to Visit 2 
(Day 1). 
oThe subject has significant abnormalities observed (after appropriate repeat 
assessments to confirm the findings) on 12 lead ECGs such as left bundle 
branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, clinically significant 
arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) or QTcF >[ADDRESS_644244] will be withdrawn prior to dosing if:
The pre-dose PI [INVESTIGATOR_500226] <5. This pre-dose PI [INVESTIGATOR_500227]; a 
subject will only be dosed if this value is ≥5. 
Note: If a subject has a baseline score of <[ADDRESS_644245] may be required to terminate study drug for reasons including the following:
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 41 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialThe subject withdraws consent.
For female subjects, diagnosis of pregnancy or stated intention to become pregnant. 
All efforts should be made by [CONTACT_103894], so 
that they are followed until delivery or termination.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103850]/reinforcement, the subject shows persistent inadequate compliance 
with required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring 
while on study drug based on Investigator’s discretion.
The subject takes prohibited treatment presenting a safety concern to continued 
dosing with study drug.
The subject requires more than 6 tablets/day (equivalent to  
) rescue medication.
At the Investigator’s discretion (it is recommended that the Investigator discusses 
with medical monitor prior to decision), if it is in the subject’s best interest due to 
occurrence of an AE and/or other findings considered to present a safety concern to 
continued dosing with study drug and warrants treatment withdrawal. Specifically, the 
following would mandate withdrawal:
oThe subject experiences a GI bleed or significant CV event.
oThe subject has significant abnormalities observed (after appropriate repeat 
assessments to confirm the findings) on 12-lead ECGs such as left bundle 
branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, clinically significant 
arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) or QTcF >500 msec.
If the blind is broken for a subject by [CONTACT_737].
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Mylan reserves the right to terminate the study for any 
reason.
The study will be terminated early if there are significant subject safety concerns that are 
indicative of a change to the risk: benefit profile for the overall study population. In this case 
the IRB will be informed accordingly.
Subjects who prematurely terminate the study will have discharge procedures performed prior 
to leaving the clinic or an Early Termination (ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible.

5.[ADDRESS_644253], will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements while at the Investigator site.
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by [CONTACT_4671].
Temperature of storage facilities should be monitored and recorded on a daily basis using 
validated devices that record maximum and minimum temperatures. Should the storage 
facility experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this 
must be reported immediately to Mylan or designee. At sites where daily monitoring and 
recording is not possible at weekends, then on the next working day after the weekend the 
temperature record (e.g., max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any 
temperature excursions. Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly 
calibrated. Affected material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion 
has been assessed and confirmed by [CONTACT_103897]. 
The Investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug. If Mylan supply drug accountability forms these must be used. 
Alternatively, Mylan may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the forms 
must identify the study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition 
on a subject-by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be 
signed by [CONTACT_47510], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_103852].
At the end of the study, Mylan will provide instructions as to disposition of any unused 
investigational product. If Mylan authorizes destruction at the study site, the Investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_103897]. Destruction 
must be adequately documented.
5.[ADDRESS_644254] Identification (SID) number, randomization number (where 
applicable) and study medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be managed by 
[CONTACT_500243] V oice/Web Response system (IVRS/IWRS). A manual containing 
complete instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be provided to each site 
prior to study start. At their first clinic visit, the IVRS/IWRS will assign a SID. Each SID will

Subjects qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be assigned an additional 
“randomization number” by [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS at randomization. Subjects will be allocated to 
treatment within blocks for the given allocation ratio.
At Visit 2 (Day 1) eligible subjects will be randomized to receive meloxicam (1.25 mg BID, 
5 mg BID, or 15 mg BID) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio through the IVRS/IWRS after the 
assessment of the subject’s eligible pain score at Visit 2. Thus randomization will take place 
between eligibility and baseline assessment.
5.[ADDRESS_644256] unblinding will be managed by [CONTACT_103899]/IWRS. 
A manual containing complete instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be 
provided to each site prior to study start.
Subject unblinding should be discouraged unless knowing the treatment received by [CONTACT_500244].

subject should be withdrawn from the study.
Pain Intensity will be measured immediately before any rescue medication is administered.
5.8 Concomitant Medications
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to 
post-study follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 47 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialadministration in the CRF. All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.
Medications taken prior to dosing with study medication will be documented as a prior 
medication. Medications taken after dosing with study medication will be documented as 
concomitant medications.
Subjects will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
section of this protocol (Section 4.2.2). Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deemed a protocol deviation and such subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_103900] (e.g., for safety reasons – see 
Section 4.2.3).
In addition to specifically named medications in Section 4.2.2 the Clinical Protocol 
(Exclusion Criteria 18) excludes subjects taking Strong CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers within

(if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS 
system. 
Once a subject enrolls in this trial the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the trial. Clinical trial site staff are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_103853]. Elements of this plan may include the following.
Thorough explanation of the complete clinical trial visit schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re-emphasis at each clinic visit.
A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the trial's 
successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment groups to the overall 
success of the trial.
Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic 
visit attendance and full study participation and compliance.
Collection of contact [CONTACT_103901] (address, phone numbers, email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits.
Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.
Immediate and multifaceted follow-up on missed clinic visits.
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_394525]. All contact [CONTACT_131994]'s medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study 
with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of 
site plans to support and retain subjects within the trial, subjects may voluntarily withdraw 
from the trial for any reason and at any time.
For a subject who completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be approximately 1.[ADDRESS_644261] prior to enrollment.

7.2.2 Categorical Pain Rating
A pain rating using a 4-point categorical rating scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) will be 
used to assess eligibility for randomization. 
Assessments will be made following surgery until a categorical baseline pain is achieved.
If the subject records moderate or severe (and a NRS pre-randomization and pre-dose ≥5) 
within 5 hours following surgery, they will be eligible for randomization. 
The categorical pain rating will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.3 Patient Global Assessment (PGA)
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be rated on a 5-point scale, ranging 
from [ADDRESS_644277] perceptible pain relief (time that the first watch stopped) is defined 
as the post-dose time at which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. 
If a subject takes rescue medication prior to recording perceptible pain relief, the stopwatches 
will be collected, and no further assessment of perceptible pain relief will be collected.
7.2.5 Time to Meaningful Pain Relief
Time to meaningful pain relief will be assessed using a double stopwatch approach. 
The time to onset of meaningful pain relief (time that the second watch stopped) is defined as 
the post-dose time at which the subject first begins to feel meaningful pain relief.
If a subject takes rescue medication prior to recording meaningful pain relief, the stopwatches 
will be collected, and no further assessment of meaningful pain relief will be collected.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 59 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialHematology and chemistry will be analyzed by a local laboratory. Urinalysis will be 
conducted at the laboratory and if urine is positive for blood, protein, nitrites, or leukocyte 
esterase, will be analyzed via microscopy/culture by a laboratory. 
Additionally, a urine drug test will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and on admission at 
Visit 2 (Day 1). If a subject has a positive test for amphetamines but is prescribed medication 
such as to treat ADHD, they would still be acceptable at the Investigator’s discretion.
Blood volumes to be collected and blood and urine sample handling instructions will be per 
the local laboratory’s standard procedures. The Investigator will provide collection materials 
for packaging and shipment of samples to the laboratory.
Any clinically significant findings in laboratory safety data should be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.
7.3.3 Vital Signs - Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) will be measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 
1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times specified in Table [ADDRESS_644279]’s arm supported at the level 
of the heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg after [ADDRESS_644280]. Where possible, the 
same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP and PR 
are acceptable, although, when done manually, PR will be measured in the brachial/radial 
artery for at least 30 seconds. Any clinically significant changes in BP and PR should be 
recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on 
the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.4 12-Lead ECG
In this study, 12-lead ECGs will be recorded using clinic ECG devices. ECGs should be 
collected at measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times 
specified in Table [ADDRESS_644281] be ≤470 msec for female or ≤[ADDRESS_644282] to be 
eligible (See Section 4.2.2). 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. Any clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities measured at screening should be assessed for their effects on 
subject eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinically significant changes between the screening and 
subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and 
seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.

8.2 Populations for Analyses
8.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set (SS) will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. Data will be summarized according to the treatment a subject actually received.
8.2.2 Intent To Treat Analysis Set
The ITT analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received study drug, including 
subjects who discontinued study treatment or received protocol allowed rescue medication.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 63 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialSubjects who were dosed in error but had a baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] <[ADDRESS_644290]-baseline pain intensity (PI) score. Subjects who were dosed in error 
but had a baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] <[ADDRESS_644291] was randomized to receive.
8.2.4 Per Protocol Analysis Set
The per protocol (PP) analysis set will include all subjects in the mITT who had no major 
protocol violation that would impact on the primary efficacy endpoint. Significant protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 9.4 and will be further defined in the SAP. In particular, 
subjects who were dosed but had a baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_27809] <[ADDRESS_644292] of major protocol deviations will be finalized prior to database lock and 
unblinding as part of the final blinded data review (BDR). Data will be summarized and 
analyzed according to the treatment a subject actually received at randomization.
8.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set

medication and who provide at least one post-dose concentration sample for the Population 
PK analysis.
8.[ADDRESS_644293] (W6LOCF) approach will be used whereby [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_103857] a given 
rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the PI [INVESTIGATOR_103858] [ADDRESS_644294] of Discontinuation
Refer to Section 8.4.5.
8.4 Statistical Analyses
8.4.1 Definition of the Primary Efficacy Estimand
The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0-24 hours for meloxicam vs. placebo for 
the modified Intent To Treat (mITT) analysis set under the assumption that rescue medication 
use is managed by a 6h windowed last observation carried forward (W6LOCF) principle.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-[ADDRESS_644295] errors, p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated.  
Standardized effect sizes will also be estimated from the E max model (effect sizes for each 
dose versus placebo divided by [CONTACT_500246] 95% confidence intervals. 
Baseline pain intensity score (PI) will be used as a covariate in the E max model. Baseline is 
defined as the mean of the pre-randomization and pre-dosing PI [INVESTIGATOR_103835]. The numerical dose 
values will be 2.5, 10, 30, and 0 for 1.25 mg BID, 5 mg BID, 15 mg BID, and placebo 
respectively.
If the E max model fails to converge, an analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) will be used to 
assess the difference between treatment groups. The ANCOV A model will include treatment 
as fixed effect and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_103840] a covariate. The difference between meloxicam and 
placebo will be estimated from the least squares means (LS means) along with the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and associated 2-sided p-values. In addition, the standardized effect 
sizes for each dose will be calculated by [CONTACT_500247].
8.4.[ADDRESS_644296] the analyses in the ITT analysis set will be made during blinded review of the 
data from the study.
8.4.5 Missing Data
The amount of missing data is expected to be minimal given the short duration of the study.
Missing pain assessments for subjects who discontinued early due to lack of efficacy, 
an AE, or intolerance to study drug will be imputed using a baseline observation 
carried forward (BOCF) approach.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 65 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialMissing pain assessments due to other reasons for discontinuing will be imputed using 
a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.
Subjects with no post-baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_500233], if 
this analysis is conducted, a BOCF approach will be used.
Intermittent missing pain assessments between two non-missing scores will be 
imputed using linear interpolation. 
The impact on the primary estimand and the methods for handling missing data may be 
assessed in secondary/sensitivity analyses and any pre-planned analyses will be fully 
described in the SAP. As this is a Phase [ADDRESS_644297]-hoc analyses may be carried out in order to more fully understand the data.
8.4.7 Definition and Analysis of the Secondary Estimands
All hypotheses will be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Nominal p-values will 
be presented for all secondary endpoints without adjustment for multiple comparisons (since 
this is a Phase 2 study). All analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary SPID Endpoints
The SPID endpoints for the time intervals 0-2, 0-4, 0-8, 0-12 and 12-24 hours will be 
analyzed using the E max/ANCOV A model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.

scored on the 5-point scale will be dichotomized and the percentage of subjects 
reporting a PGA score of 2 (good) or better defined as a responder.
The number and percentage of responders in each treatment group will be summarized. A 
comparison between meloxicam and placebo will be evaluated with the odds ratio (OR) and 
corresponding 95% confidence interval from a logistic regression model with treatment group 
and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a covariate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Frequency of Rescue Medication Use 
The frequency of rescue medication use will be summarized and graphically presented for the

determined by a bioanalytical laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Details of the 
validated bioanalytical method used will be provided in a separate bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data for meloxicam will be listed, summarized on the basis of time 
intervals, and plotted using a scatter plot with time relative to the preceding meloxicam 
dosing time. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of 
subjects, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for plasma concentrations for each 
time interval and by [CONTACT_1570].
Population PK (PPK) analysis of meloxicam concentrations may be performed using 
modeling. The PPK analysis will be conducted and reported separately. Details of the PPK 
model building will be described in a separate PPK analysis plan.

10 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING
The adverse event collection period begins at signing of informed consent and continues until 
the telephone End of Study (EOS) Visit. Adverse events occurring during this period need to 
be reported to the Sponsor according to Section 10.5.1. The Investigator is also responsible 
for notifying the Sponsor if he/she becomes aware of any adverse event after the study period 
has ended and it is considered related to the study medication (i.e., an adverse drug reaction). 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_103863].
10.1 Definitions
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory or physical findings, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 72 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialClinically significant changes from baseline in laboratory assessments, vital signs, and 
physical examination are to be recorded as adverse events. Clinically significant 
abnormalities include:
a result associated with accompanying signs/symptoms 
a result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a result that leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy 
a result considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_500250], in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event. 
An abnormal safety assessment (e.g., laboratory, vital signs, ECG) associated with a 
clinical diagnosis that has been recorded as an AE does not require a separate AE 
entry
Events meeting the definition of an AE also include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug or drug-food 
interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. (Please refer to the Section 10.2 for further 
details.) 
A symptom or medical complication related to a protocol-mandated intervention, 
including screening procedures
Serious Adverse Event
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE 
that is: 
fatal
life-threatening
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500235]-TFZ-2001 Page 73 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialNote: In patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] 24 hours in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103865]. An 
elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88909] a condition present before exposure to the study drug or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or 
event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103866], 
organization or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to 
be considered an SAE.
oEvents NOT to be reported as SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]: 
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not 
associated with any deterioration in condition 
Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not 
worsen 
Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103867] (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical 
care) 
Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling 
any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103869]: Rehabilitation 
facilities, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593], Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief), Skilled 
nursing facilities, Nursing homes 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important medical event (medically significant)
oNote: medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103870] / or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
oThe seriousness criterion of “medically significant” should only be selected 
when none of the other seriousness criteria apply to the event but the 
Investigator still considers the event as serious.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-[ADDRESS_644309] should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase 
“responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an 
investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by [CONTACT_500251] a reasonable causal relationship to an 
investigational product will be designated as ADRs.
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated as if the relationship were “possible.”
Expected/Unexpected Adverse Event
An expected AE is defined as one whose nature, severity or outcome is consistent with the 
applicable reference safety information described of the study drugs. 
An AE is to be considered unexpected if the nature, severity or outcome is not consistent with 
the applicable product reference safety information.
Preexisting Condition
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline medical history and not reported as an AE. A baseline or preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.
General Physical Examination Findings
Any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event
At the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_500252](s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The Investigator should notify the 
study Sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study. 
The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator becomes aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has 
participated in this study. 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 75 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential10.2 Special Situations
The following situations may by [CONTACT_121] a serious outcome and should be evaluated 
for expedited reporting to the Sponsor.
Any diagnosis of Cancer or Neoplasm is to be reported as a serious adverse event.
Emergency Room Visits:  Events that result in emergency room visits that do not 
result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103871]; 
however, these events should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., 
life-threatening, other serious [medically significant] events).
Overdose: Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent; this should be 
reported regardless of sequelae. Signs and symptoms associated with accidental 
overdose are to be recorded as adverse events or as serious AEs. If adverse events 
associated with overdose fulfil any of the serious criteria (as defined in section 
‘Serious Adverse Event’), a completed SAE report form is required to be submitted.
Reports of Drug-drug interaction and Drug Abuse and Medication Errors: drug 
interactions or abuse of the study medication must be recorded as AEs. Medication 
errors will be captured as protocol deviations while any associated signs or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs on the CRF. In addition, any serious consequence of drug 
interactions, drug abuse, or medication error must be reported immediately if these 
fulfil any of the SAE criteria.
10.2.[ADDRESS_644310] given that meloxicam is an NSAID will include the 
following:
Myocardial Infarction/Unstable Angina
Stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Heart Failure
Cardiac Arrhythmia (Atrial & Ventricular)
Gastrointestinal hemorrhages NEC
Gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation
Any AESI should be reported per the SAE reporting process per Section 10.5.
10.[ADDRESS_644311] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events should be 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 76 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialrecorded immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of 
the CRF. Information to be collected includes AE name [CONTACT_81620] (in standard medical 
terminology) and final diagnosis, event description, time and date of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, seriousness, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_214527] a diagnosis), action taken with the study drug, treatment 
for the event and time (if available) and date of resolution/stabilization of the event.
Any findings from protocol specified safety assessments that are associated with the 
indication being studied are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless judged by [CONTACT_152889]’s condition. 
All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal results of diagnostic procedures should be 
grouped under one diagnosis on the CRF where possible and appropriate.
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the outcome. Any adverse event that occurs after the study period and is related to 
the study treatment or study participation should be recorded; and if serious, the Investigator 
should also immediately report it to the Sponsor.
10.4 Classification of an Adverse Event
10.4.1 Severity
The Investigator will assign a severity rating to each AE. For purposes of consistency, the 
following scale is to be used:
Grade [ADDRESS_644312]'s usual function.
Grade [ADDRESS_644313]'s usual function.
Grade [ADDRESS_644314]'s usual function.
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and Serious AEs. Severity is a classification 
of intensity, whereas an SAE is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria (see 
definitions, Serious Adverse Event).
10.4.2 Causality
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_500253]. The Investigator is required to assess causality 
of each AE.
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must assess the relationship of each AE (serious and non-serious) to the study 
treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 77 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialFactors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include: Temporal 
relationship, Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s), Pharmacological 
plausibility, Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history), Drug 
interactions, De-challenge/re-challenge, Dose relationship.
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment 
in accordance with the following definitions:
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 78 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialCategory Causality Description
DEFINITE Causal relationship is certain For example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de-challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory re-challenge procedure if necessary.
PROBABLE High degree of certainty for 
causal relationshipFor example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, 
there is a clinically compatible response to 
de-challenge (re-challenge is not required), and 
other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.
POSSIBLE Causal relationship is 
uncertainFor example: the temporal relationship between 
study treatment exposure and the AE onset/course 
is reasonable or unknown, de-challenge 
information is either unknown or equivocal; could 
also be explained by [CONTACT_19699].
UNLIKELY Causal relationship is 
improbableAnother explanation is more likely such as disease, 
environment, or other medication.
Does not represent a known reaction to study drug.
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATEDNo possible relationship The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug 
is impossible
For SAEs, if the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided when possible (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events, study-related procedure).
10.4.[ADDRESS_644315] observation will be classified as:
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 79 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialRECOVERED/RESOLVED where the subject recuperated and is free of any 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.
RECOVERED WITH SEQUELAE where the subject recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (i.e., ongoing) where the subject has not recuperated 
from the condition or injury and the event is still considered ongoing.
RECOVERING where the subject has begun to recuperate from the condition or injury, but 
the event is considered ongoing at a reduced intensity.
FATAL the condition or injury results in the subject’s death. The Investigator should identify 
the principal cause of death and assign Fatal outcome to that event. Other concurrent ongoing 
AE/SAEs present at the time of death would remain Not recovered/Not resolved.
UNKNOWN can be selected if none of the other situations apply or are known. Follow-up 
should be conducted to obtain one of the preceding outcomes.
10.4.[ADDRESS_644316] conform to the serious 
adverse event reporting timelines, formats, and requirements of the various entities to which 
they are responsible. 
10.5.1 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor
Immediate notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_500254].
Mylan will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and Investigators.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-[ADDRESS_644317] be reported to the study Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. 
To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report form must be completed and 
signed by [CONTACT_500255]:
If the initial notification using the completed ‘SAE report form’ is not possible, the 
notification may be made via email/fax or over telephone with the following minimum 
necessary information
Study identifier
Study Center
Subject number
A description of the eventCurrent status (outcome of event-if known 
and whether study medication is continuing)
The reason why the event is classified as 
serious
Investigator assessment of the causality 
between the event and study treatment
The Investigator should provide further information on the event as soon as possible, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_644318] (e.g., name, address, medical record number) must be de-identified before 
submission to Mylan or its designee. The subject’s study specific ID number should be 
recorded on every page of documentation forwarded to the Sponsor.

complying with their local EC’s reporting requirements. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_103874]’s study file.
10.5.4 Investigator Reporting of Pregnancy: Notifying the Study Sponsor 
All subjects who participate in the study should be counseled on the need to practice adequate 
birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation as 
detailed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pregnancy testing will be conducted 
throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of assessments.
A subject who is found to be pregnant at the screening visit will be excluded from the study 
and will be a screening failure. 
Subjects who have been enrolled in the study should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_500256]. Early termination visit 
assessments are required as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. Pregnant 
females will be discontinued from study treatment by [CONTACT_737]. A male that has a 
partner that becomes pregnant during the study will not be discontinued from study treatment. 
Details of the pregnancy should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report form and reported to 
Mylan PSRM within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_6968]  (primary) or 
facsimile from the time of initial awareness, even if beyond the closure of 
the clinical database. 
The Investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy every [ADDRESS_644321] been exposed to the study drug(s), should be followed-up in order 
to collect information on the:
outcome of the pregnancy,
outcome for both mother and fetus (malformation/anomalies diagnosed since initial 
report)
development of the child after birth (developmental assessment, infant illnesses, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], breastfeeding)
Healthy newborns should be followed-up at 1 month after birth to confirm no congenital 
anomalies were subsequently detected (if possible).
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the Sponsor.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 82 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialElective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
considered an elective procedure and not an AE; nevertheless, Mylan requests the outcome 
(e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours of awareness and sent as a follow-up 
on the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form). 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_500257], must be promptly reported to Mylan PSRM.
If the study center becomes aware of a pregnancy in a female partner of a male subject, study 
personnel should contact [CONTACT_103926] a partner pregnancy ICF. 
Consent of the pregnant partner must be obtained before any details of the pregnancy can be 
shared with Mylan or its designated representative. If the pregnant partner provides consent 
to have the pregnancy followed, the study center should collect the information specified on 
the Pregnancy Report form and forward the completed form to Mylan PSRM every [ADDRESS_644322]

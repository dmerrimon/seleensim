2. Why is this research being done? 
This research is being done to learn more about an approach to remove Methicillin resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in patients who are carriers of the bacteria in outpatient settings and 
among their hous
ehold members and sexual partners. 
 
MRSA is a type of bacteria or germ that can cause bad infections of the skin that can make people very 
sick.  The bac
teria have been seen in a high number of persons in the Baltimore area and in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396405] c
ountry.   MRSA can be spread from person to person, particularly in homes and among 
family members and sexual partners.   
 
There are three things we hope to learn from this research study:  
1) First, we want to find a way to prevent MRSA infections in outpatient settings.  By [CONTACT_396421], 
we want to look at the things that may increase the risk of having this type of bacteria in you and 
your family members.   
2) Second, we have soaps and oral rinses (Chlorhexidine) and medications (antibiotics; Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396406]) tha
t have been shown to be effective at removing MRSA.  We want to determine if these 
antibiotics and soaps are best used for everyone in the household or only the individual with known 
MRSA.   
3) Third, we want to learn more about the bacteria by [CONTACT_396422].  We will do laboratory 
tests on samples we collect, to learn how MRSA bacteria grow, reproduce and how it develops to 
behave differently than other types of MRSA bacteria. 
 
People who carry the MRSA bacteria at any location on their body may join this study.  
 
How many people will be in this study?  
About 520 men, women and children could take part in this study in Baltimore City.  About 50 
participants will be assigned to the individual group and we anticipate screening about 4 members of the 
household/sex partner in this group.  About 50 people will be enrolled in the household/sex partner 
group and we anticipate screening and treating 4 members of the household in this group.  We believe 
500 individuals in total will be enrolled in this study.  Each person will be in this study for 
approximately 6 months.  
 
3. What will happen if you join this study?  
If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things: 
 
1) Complete a brief survey.  This questionnaire will ask you for some demographic information and 
questions about your health history. 
2) Allow us to look at the electronic
 or paper medical chart, if part of the Johns Hopkins Medical 
Institutions.  This will include evaluating your medication, prior laboratory studies and past clinician 
visits.  
3) Allow us to collect:

 Male and female children, under the age of 18 will receive a swab of their nose, throat and 
rectum only.  
 All participants, regardless of age will receive a cotton swab of any open or draining skin bump 
or wound.  
 
Cotton swabs wil
l be processed at the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396408]. 
 If a wound is cultured and determined to be infected by [CONTACT_115962], you and your primary medical 
provider wil
l be notified of the result.   
4) Discuss the study with your household member and sexual partners and inform them that the study 
team will be in contact [CONTACT_116744]. 
 
 If your samples are positive for MRSA you and your household members and sexual partner will 
qua
lify for study participation.  You will have completed the study if your MRSA result is 
negative.     
 If you have an infection caused by [CONTACT_115962], the study team will notify you and/or your treatment 
team or y
our healthcare provider who will determine the need for treatment of the infection.  
 
If y
our MRSA result is positive you will then be assigned to one of two groups randomly (by [CONTACT_3364], 
like “flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin”).  The same exact study procedures are followed for both groups except for those 
who receive MRSA testing, soap and antibiotics.  These two groups are known as the individual group 
and the household group.   
 
 Individual group: Fifty participants will be assigned to this group. Household members may receive 
screening if they choose, but will not receive soap or medication if you are assigned to this group. 
Only you will receive soap and medication. We ask that you not share this with your family.  MRSA 
screening and use of the soap/antibiotic will focus only on you.  After completion of the final study 
visit your household members/sexual partner may receive treatment.  
 
 Household/sex partner group: Fifty participants will be assigned to this group.  Household members 
and your main sexual partner will be able to participate in this group.  We will set up a time that is 
convenient for you and your household members to participate.  You will have the option of 
scheduling an appointment at Johns Hopkins or two members of the study team will make a home 
visit.  It is your choice based on what best suits your needs.  Soap and medication will be provided 
for the entire household based on age appropriate treatment plan.   
 
After your group assignment :  
Once you have been assigned to your specific group and your household members and/or sexual partner 
has agreed to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the research assistant will work with you to schedule either a home visit or 
clinic visits for your household members and sexual partner.  This will need to be completed prior to 
receiving your study medications.  This should occur within 7 days of your signing consent for 
participation.   
 
You will be notified about your result before we screen anyone else in your household.  If you are 
MRSA negative, you and your household members and/or sexual partner do not qualify for the study.

4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study? 
The risks for this study are minimal; however, you do not require treatment for MRSA colonization.  If 
you do nothing, you and your family, may live the remainder of your lives without an MRSA infection.  
If you have a history of MRSA infection, this could reduce your chance of repeat infection, but that is 
not guaranteed.    
 
Risk of Obtaining the MRSA Swabs :  
There is a very small risk of bleeding associated with swabbing mucosal membranes; however, our 
institution has a long standing history of obtaining nares surveillance cultures for MRSA without any 
reported adverse events.  All swabs will be collected in a private exam room if at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396409].  A female chaperone will be present at all times when specimens are being 
obtained from a fe
male patient by a male clinician as is the standard in our clinic during gynecologic 
evaluations.    
 
Risk with Study Medications and Soaps/Oral Rinse:  
Allergic reactions to mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396410]/or chlorhexidine soap or oral rinse are rare.  Patients with a 
known allergy will be excluded from the study.  All agents are FDA cleared for the purposes used in this 
study.  Be
low you will find a detailed listing of possible side effects.   
 
Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396411] :  
Local adverse effects may be associated with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396412]. Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396413] m
ay commonly cause a sensation of itching, pain, stinging, and burning. Local effects from the 
nasal cream have included minor nose bleeding, runny nose, brief changes in taste, dry mouth, sore 
throat, burning
, and cough.  Stomach side effects may include nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 
Nervous system si
de effects associated with intranasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19177]. Dizziness has 
been reported with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19178]. Ocular side effects associated with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396414] a possible inflammation in the eye.

Chlorhexidine gluconate Oral Rinse Possible Adverse Effects :  
Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been reported as side effects associated with use of 
Chlorhexidi
ne gluconate rinse. The following oral side effects were reported during adult clinical trails: 
painful ulcers, infection of the gums, trauma, redness, peeling of skin in your mouth, coated tongue, 
chang
es in tongue texture. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1%  (1 out of 100). Among post 
marketing
 reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with Chlorhexidine 
gluconate oral rinse are swelling and possible pain/inflammation in tongue and gums, ulcer, dry mouth, 
swelling of tongue, and numbness of mouth. Minor irritation and superficial peeling of skin of the oral 
mucosa have b
een noted in patients using Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.   
 
Chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibiclens) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_396415] :  
The soap may cause burning and dryness of the skin.   It may cause burning of the eyes. Skin erythema 
and roug
hness, dryness, sensitization, allergic reactions are possible, but rare. 
 
Interviews/Questionnaires :  
You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions or when you are completing 
questionnaire
s. You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.  To protect the 
privacy of 
each individual family member, all interviews and questionnaires of the family will be 
conducted privately.   
 
Home Visit: 
If, as part of the study, we visit your home, Maryland law requires us to tell the local or state authorities 
if we suspect abuse or neglect of a child or dependent adult. If you tell us that you plan to harm 
someone, we are required to contact [CONTACT_396423]. We may also warn the person who is at risk. 
 
5. Are there risks related to pregnancy?  
Pregnant women are not eligible to participate in this study.  Please tell us if you are pregnant or believe 
you may be pregnant.  Please inform us if you become pregnant while participating in this study.  While 
it is not expected, this research may hurt an embryo or fetus in ways we do not currently know.   
 
6. Are there benefits to being in the study? 
There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study.  If you take part in this study, you may help 
others in the future and will improve our understanding of how to prevent MRSA transmission in 
families.  
 
7. What are your options if you do not want to be in the study? 
If you decide not to join this study, other options are available.  You do not have to join this study to get 
treatment.  You can speak with your medical provider to discuss each of the options available to you in 
this study.   
 
You do not have to join this study.  If you do not join, your care at Johns Hopkins will not be affected. 
 
8. Will i
t cost you anything to be in this study?    
You will receive a separate Insurance and Research Participant Financial Responsibility Information 
Sheet.  
 
This Sheet will give you the following information: 
 The procedures, tests, drugs or devices that are part of this research and that will be paid for by 
[CONTACT_1758] (no 
cost to you).

2. Why is this research being done? 
This research is being done to learn more about an approach to remove Methicillin resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in patients who are carriers of the bacteria in outpatient settings and 
among their household members and sexual partners. 
 
MRSA is a type of bacteria or germ that can cause bad infections of the skin that can make people very 
sick.  The bac
teria have been seen in a high number of persons in the Baltimore area and in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396405] c
ountry.   MRSA can be spread from person to person, particularly in homes and among 
family members and sexual partners.   
 
There are three things we hope to learn from this research study:  
1) First, we want to find a way to prevent MRSA infections in outpatient settings.  By [CONTACT_396421], 
we want to look at the thi
ngs that may increase the risk of having this type of bacteria in you and 
your family members.   
2) Second, we have soaps and oral rinses (Chlorhexidine) and medications (antibiotics; Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_396406]) that ha
ve been shown to be effective at removing MRSA.  We want to determine if these 
antibiotics and soaps are best used for everyone in the household or only the individual with known 
MRSA.   
3) Third, we want to learn more about the bacteria by [CONTACT_396422].  We will do laboratory 
tests on samples we collect, to learn how MRSA bacteria grow, reproduce and how it develops to 
behave differently than other types of MRSA bacteria. 
 
How many people will be in this study?  
About 520 men, women and children could take part in this study in Baltimore City.  About 50 
participants will be assigned to the individual group and we anticipate screening about 4 members of the 
household/sex partner in this group.  About 50 people will be enrolled in the household/sex partner 
group and we anticipate screening and treating 4 members of the household in this group.  We believe 
500 individuals in total will be enrolled in this study.  Each person will be in this study for 
approximately 6 months. 
 
3. What will happen if you join this study? 
If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things: 
 
1) Complete a brief survey.  This questionnaire will ask you for some demographic information and 
questions about your health history. 
2) Allow us to look at the electronic
 or paper medical chart, if part of the Johns Hopkins Medical 
Institutions.  This will include evaluating your medication, prior laboratory studies and past clinician 
visits.  
3) Allow us to collect:   
 If you are an adult over 18, a cotton swab of your nose, throat, groin (area between genitals and 
rectum
), the rectum, and the vagina (for women).  A single new swab is placed in each location 
and rotated in a circle to pi[INVESTIGATOR_396407].

 Male and female children, under the age of 18 will receive a swab of their nose, throat and 
rectum 
only.  
 All participants, regardless of age will receive a cotton swab of any open or draining skin bump 
or wound. 
 
Cotton swabs wil
l be processed at the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396419]. 
We will notif
y each member of your household individually and will inform the adult participant about 
the status of children during the scheduled phone call after the enrollment visit.  Once you have been 
screened, it usually takes about [ADDRESS_498674] the result.   
 
If a wound is cultured and determined to be infected by [CONTACT_115962], you and your primary medical provider 
will be notified of the result.  If your family member has a wound, we will notify the person (or 
parent/legally authorized representative for a child).  If the family member does not have a primary 
medical provider, we will provide details about clinic locations that would offer treatment for this 
infection.   
 
 You have been assigned to the intervention part of this study.  This includes use of antibiotics for the 
nose, if nee
ded, and special soap for everyone who agrees to participate in your home.   
 If you have an infection caused by [CONTACT_115962], the study team will notify you and/or your treatment team 
or your healthcare provider who will determine the need for treatment of the infection.  
 
How long will you be in the study? 
You will be in this study for just over 6 months.  This will include your baseline screening visit, baseline 
follow-up, your treatment period of 7 days, visit 1 (post treatment) followed by a follow up period of 6 
months.

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019   Page 6 of 95 
  Trial Design: This is a master protocol, intended to evaluate multiple immune modulation strategies in 
combination with HS-110; subsequent treatment arms  will be added by [CONTACT_790375][INVESTIGATOR_790355].  Patients will be assigned  to treatment arms based on the fit to eligibility criteria .  
As of Amendment 4, the Phase 1b portion of the trial  (consisting of the first 15 patients to receive HS -110 in 
combination with nivo lumab)  is complete . Subsequent patients and cohorts will be considered  Phase 2. Treatment 
Arm 1 (HS -110 plus oxygen , n=1 patient ) has been discontinued . Patients in previously designated Arms 2, 3, and 
4 all received HS -110 + nivolumab but had different TI L status. Patients from these arms have now been 
reclassified as Arm 5, and further enrollment into this arm is ongoing.    
As of Amendment 5, the patient population under study was expanded to include front l ine patients who have 
received immunotherapy (wi th or without chemotherapy), who have not progressed clinically or radiographically 
(per RECIST 1.1)  at the most recent imaging assessment , and who will begin maintenance immunotherapy with 
SOC pembrolizumab  ± pemetrexed . HS-[ADDRESS_1089251] 
be initiated on or before maintenance cycle 3 (after completion of platinum chemotherapy ), or no later than week 
19 (if receiving front line pembrolizumab monotherapy).  
Patients who meet a ll eligibility criteria will be enrolled to the below treatment arm s and cohorts , until the total 
sample size for Phase 2 is met ( n=105) in addition to the Phase 1b sample size (n=15) for a total study sample size 
of approximately 120 evaluable patients:   
Arm 5: HS-110 plus SOC  nivolumab  (n=100, to include 15 phase 1b patients and 85 phase 2 patients )   
Arm 6:  HS-110 plus SOC pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed  (n=up to 20 phase 2 patients ).  
Arm 5 p atients will receive  a combin ation of weekly HS-110 administered as 5 intradermal 0.1  mL injections at a 
dose of 1 × 107 viable cells/ 0.[ADDRESS_1089252] . After the completion of 18 weeks of combination therapy, patients 
may receive either nivolumab dosing schedule listed in the current approved  package insert (every 2 weeks o r every 
4 weeks)  per Investigator  discretion .  
Arm 5 patients will be scanned radiographically at Screening, Week 9, Week 18, and every 8 weeks thereafter until 
confirmed d isease progression.  
Arm 6 patients will receive a combination of weekly HS-110 administered a s 5 intradermal 0.1  mL injections at a 
dose of 1  107 viable cells/0.5  mL for 1 3 weeks in combination with SOC pembrolizumab  ± pemetrexed every [ADDRESS_1089253] ing every 3 weeks 
in combination with SOC pembrolizumab  ± pemetrexed until confirmed disease prog ression  or unacceptable 
toxicity, whichever occurs first.  
Arm [ADDRESS_1089254], patients with unconfirmed disease progression  
(iUPD ) should continue on study treatment until confirmed progression  (iCPD) unless clinical progression 
necessitates otherwise . 
For all study patients, screening t umor samples (archival or fresh) and on -treatment biopsy tumor samples may be 
screened  for expression of immune active cell subsets and  molecules, expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells,  and 
Heat Biologics, Inc.   Viagenpumatucel -L 
Protocol HS110 -[ADDRESS_1089255] -treatment TIL and PD -L1 levels with be correlated with clinical 
outcomes.  
Peripheral b lood samples will be taken to evaluate tumor mutation burden and immune cell subsets  for correlation 
with clinical ou tcomes .  
Safety  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_790376] s (AEs), evaluation of cl inical laboratory parameters 
(hematology, liver function, electrolytes, troponin, and renal function) , vital signs, electrocardiogram ( ECG ), and 
physical exams  (PEs) . 
Efficacy will be assess ed by [CONTACT_790377] , DOR , DCR, DRR  and PFS by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 .

Safety Parameters:  
Primary Endpoint : 
Phase  1b: Safety and Tolerability:  Measured by [CONTACT_790379] 
(TEAEs)/serious adverse events (SAE s), including clinically significant (CS) abnormal laboratory parameters, 
ECGs, PEs, and vital signs in patients receiving at least 1 dose of HS-110.  
Effica cy Parameters:  
Primary Endpoint s: 
Phase  2: Arm 5 - Objective Response Rate: Defined as the number of patients achieving a best overall response 
of complete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 , divided by [CONTACT_790380].  This will be calculated for each cohort.  Note that ORR will be a secondary endpoint for Arm 6.  
Phase 2: Arm 6 - Progression -Free Survival:  Calculated as the time between the  date of first dose of HS -[ADDRESS_1089266] evaluable tumor assessment.  This will be calculated for each 
cohort.  Note that PFS will be a secondary endpoint for Arm 5.  
Secondary Endpoint s:

Duration of Response  (DOR) : Calculated from the time of first response (CR or PR) until radiographic  PD (per 
RECIST 1.1) or clinical deterioration requ iring a change of treatment.  
Disease Control Rate (DCR):  Defined as the p roportion of evaluable patients  whose best overall response is PR, 
CR, or SD by [CONTACT_393]  1.1.  
Durable Response Rate  (DRR /): Defined as the % of responders  (CR or PR)  with durable responses lasting at 
least 6 months from time of initial response.  DRR will be calculated at 6 and 12 months.  
OS Rate : Defined as the p roportion of patients who are alive at [ADDRESS_1089268] dose of HS -
110.PFS Rate:  Define d as the p roportion of patients who have not progressed  at [ADDRESS_1089269]

Per-Protocol (PP) Population: all patients who have received at l east [ADDRESS_1089271]-treatment tumor  assessment.  
Adenocarcinoma Population:  all patie nts in the PP who have adenocarcinoma histology  
The Phase 1b portion is an exploratory substudy with safety as a primary endpoint. In Phase 2, t he results from  
each cohort in Arm 5  and Arm 6 will be tabulated separately . 
Arm 5 will include 2 cohorts , with a primary endpoint of ORR for each cohort:  
- Cohort A: CPI  [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve patients   (n=40)  
- Cohort B: CPI  [INVESTIGATOR_790356]  (n=60) . Note that this Cohort will be permitted to over -enroll based on 
patient availability.  
 
Arm 6 is an exploratory arm that will include up to 20 patients in 2 cohorts  pending patient availability . The 
primary endpoint for each cohort will be PFS. The distribution of patients between these cohorts will not be 
control led:   
 
- Cohort C: Maintenance pembrolizumab  
- Cohort D: Maintenance pembrolizumab + pemetrexed  
 
Each  cohort (A, B, C and D) will be analyzed including patients  of all histology types , and then again including 
only adenocarcinoma patients.  
Analyses will be performed within each of the cohorts to identify differences in strata for each of the following 
factors , provided sufficient data exists : 
• Histology: a denocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma  
• PD-L1 status : negative ( <1% ) and positive  (≥1% ) based on tumor  cell expression

  • TIL status : high (> 10%) and low (≤ 10%)  
• Tumor Mutation Burden : high  (10 or more mutations) and low (less than 10 mutations)  
Additional factors , such as line of treatment or presence of injection site reactions,  may be added to statistical 
models used for analyse s; the method of pooling and testing for interaction among the different factors  for the 
different cohorts  will be described in detail in the SAP.   
With a total enrollment into this hypothesis -generating clinical trial of up to [ADDRESS_1089272] a clinically meaningful benefit over SOC alone . No formal hypothesis testing wil l be performed.  
Baseline demographic and clinical data (safety and efficacy) as well as all exploratory endpoints will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics  (means, median s, proportions, standard deviations, minima, and maxima). 
Time -to-event endpoint s (PFS /iPFS , OS) will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier methodology.  All summaries of  
binary efficacy  endpoints such as immune response, DCR /iDCR  and ORR will be presented with exact 95% CI for 
each cohort.

  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  
The annual incidence of non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the [LOCATION_002] is estimated at 
~222,[ADDRESS_1089282] local or distal metastatic le sions upon diagnosis (stage IV) and the disease has a poor  5-year 
survival rate of 5.2%.[ADDRESS_1089283]-line and subsequent therapy for advanced NSCLC remains sub -optimal.  
Treatment strateg ies include consideration regarding tumor histology, molecular pathology, age, 
and comorbidities. In patients without mutations  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR ), 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK ) or c-ros oncogene 1 ( ROS1 ) rearrangements , first-line therapy 
generally includes platinum -based doublet chemotherapy, with or without the anti -vascular 
endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antibody, bevacizumab . Patients with mutations can 
significantly delay disease progression by [CONTACT_790381], therefore 
treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor s (TKIs ) should be considered a first line treatment in this 
patient population2.  The programmed death -1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab  (KEYTRUDA) 
has recently been approved by [CONTACT_4760] a first line single agent therapy in patients with  
programmed cell death ligand -1 (PD-L1) expression more than 50% with negative or unknown 
results for EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, and ROS1 rearrangements. In addition, 
pembrolizumab is now used in combination with carboplatin/pemetrexed (PARAPLATIN® among 
others /ALIMTA®) as first -line therapy for patients with advanced non -squamous NSCLC or 
NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS) based  on the Keynote -[ADDRESS_1089284] of care (SOC) for second line therapy of NSCLC includes treatment with  
monoclonal antibody (mAB)  immune check point inhibitors (CPI) such as nivolumab  (OPDIVO®), 
pembrolizumab and atezolizumab . These checkpoint inhibitors have delivered objective responses 
of ~20% in an unselected NSCLC population, with impressive clinical results in a subset of 
programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) positive patients . Specific subgroup analysis of single agent 
nivolu mab found response rates in previously treated (second line) non -squamous patients to be 
17 to 20%, and in squamous patients to be 14.5 to 20%4,5. PD-L1 expression is often associated 
with T -cell activation and patients with a low level of existing tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TIL) appear to be less likely to respond to checkpoint inhibition.  In fact, 60 -70% of NCSLC  
patients are TIL -negative, whi ch may be a contributing factor in the low overall response rate to 
checkpoint therapy in this unselected patient population.  
These observations support the hypothesis that  tumor -specific T -cell activation enhances the 
clinical activity of checkpoint ther apy. HS-[ADDRESS_1089285] to stimulate a CD8+ T -cell 
response toward tumor associated antigens to enhance checkpoint therapy in treating NSCLC.  This 
trial will include both CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve and CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790358].  The relatively poor responses seen  
with second -line and subsequent treatments are due to a combination of progressive biological 
resistance of the underlying tumor arising from successive regimens of chemotherapy and a decline 
in the performance status of patients, due to treatment - and di sease -related morbidities.   
The large and increasing population of patients being delivered  checkpoint inhibitor therapy  to the 
post-first-line setting , open s an opportunity to combine an immunostimulatory vaccine, HS-110, 
Heat Biologics, Inc.   Viagenpumatucel -L 
Protocol HS110 -[ADDRESS_1089286] t reatment. Since the historical  objective response rate ( ORR ) for 
nivolumab as second line agent in NSCLC is 20%, this is a population that could derive benefit 
from the immunostimulating ability of HS-[ADDRESS_1089287] an unknown response rate to nivolumab as a s ingle agent in the second -
line setting. It is currently recommended for second -line therapy per National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network  (NCCN ) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology™ , but there is an insufficient 
quantity of data stating the exact ORR of n ivolumab after a patient has progressed on first-line 
pembrolizumab. It can be understood logically to be a lower response, as the patient previously 
progressed while on the CPI [CONTACT_409520] -line setting.  
HS-[ADDRESS_1089288] the potential to trigger a durable antitumor response with minimal toxicity, thus 
presenting an attractive alternative for NSCLC treatments. Vaccine -based therapy utilizing an 
autologous or allogeneic antigenic stimulus to promote endogenous a ntitumor immun e activation 
is currently being heavily investigated in the clinic. Melanoma -associated antigen 3 (MAGE -A3) 
and mucin 1 glycoprotein (MUC1)  are antigen s specifically associated with various solid tumors, 
including NSCLC . 6,[ADDRESS_1089289] experienced clinical benefit.8,9 
The L-BLP25  vaccine  administered in  combination with cyclophosphamide , failed to show an 
overal l survival (OS) advantage against placebo  in unresectable stage IIIB NSCLC after definitive 
chemoradiation.7,10  
Although up to 50% of patient tumors may exp ress either MAGE -A3 and/or MUC1, the expression 
of these antigens within an individual tumor is rarely uniform , reflecti ng the  underlying genetic 
heterogeneity of tumors , and suggests that patients who may be positive for a particular molecular 
signature [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or antigen may also have a significant tumor burden that is neg ative for those same 
molecular targets, thus leading to ineffective treatment for single -agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Following 
treatment with a single -antigen vaccine, even in the presence of  a robust immune response, 
MAGE -A3 or MUC1 negative tumor cells may be resis tant to a tumor -specific immune response. 
Furthermore, these trials did not enrich their patient population through selection for specific 
biomarkers that may exist in certain patients who may have benefitted from either of these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
5.3. Vaccine Combi nation Approaches to NSCLC  
Tumor heterogeneity, as evidenced by [CONTACT_790382] -agent 
chemotherapeutic interventions, strongly suggests that a multi -targeted approach may be more 
successful; however, combinations with traditional chem otherapeutic agents alone remains 
difficult due to the overt toxicity caused by [CONTACT_790383]. Due to the lack of such toxicity with 
vaccine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], this is an attractive therapeutic option being investigated.

  Recent phase 3 results of tumor cell vaccine, belagenpuma tucel -L, showed that  while the vaccine 
failed to improve OS across the entire study population, an additional subset analysis suggested 
that there was a survival benefit for belagenpumatucel -L treated patients who had recently 
complet ed front -line chemotherapy and in those who received front -line combination radiation 
chemotherapy .11,12 Additionally, TG4010  (a recombinant viral vector genetically modified to 
express MUC1 and interleukin -2 [IL -2]), added to first-line chemotherapy , resulted in  an increase 
in OS in NSCLC patients.13 Furthermore, a better clinical outcome was observed in 
TG4010 -treated  patients with a normal percentage of triple positive activated lymphocytes 
(CD1 6 + CD56 + CD69+ [TrPAL]) when compared to patients with a high percentage of TrPAL .  
The vaccine combination approaches of the current trial are predicated on an assumption that 
significant localized immunosuppression exists within the tumor microenvironment, mediate d 
mainly by [CONTACT_30962] T -cells (T-regs), predominately driven by [CONTACT_790384], 
intra-tumor hypoxia, and extracellular adenosine.  The consequent dow n-regulation of the 
CD4 + CD8 + T-cell population results in a formidable degree of tumor  immunodefense against 
tumor -directed vaccine strategies.  A number of studies have consistently suggested elevated T -reg 
levels in NSCLC  and a direct association with both an adverse prognostic outcome  and response 
to therapy, findings of direct relevance to the currently proposed therapeutic strategy, predicated 
as it is on T-cell targeting.14,15 T-regs in NSCLC also appear to exhibit  particularly high levels of 
PD-L1 and CTLA -4, supporting their pi[INVESTIGATOR_790359] c ontrol of the neoplastic immune milieu 
and further implicating them as suitable targets for therapeutic immuno -intervention.15,16 
5.4. Description of Investi gational Agent,  HS-110 
HS-110 (v iagenpumatucel -L) is an allogeneic, cell -based immunotherapy containing a broad range 
of NSCLC tumor antigens (up to 66 known cancer testis antigens) combined with a specific 
mechanism for the transport of these antigens to patient a ntigen -presenting cells that results in  a 
specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell response.  
Gp96 is a member of the heat -shock protein family and has evolved specific characteristics that 
are advantageous for a therapeutic cancer vaccine.  Similar to other heat sho ck proteins, gp96 is an 
intracellular protein that functions as a protein chaperone to facilitate the proper folding of other 
cellular proteins.  In contrast to other heat -shock proteins, endogenous gp96 is restricted to the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via  expression of a KDEL  (target peptide sequence) ER retention 
sequence on its C -terminus.  Within the ER, gp96 is exposed to a majority of proteins and antigens 
that eventually are displayed on MHC I.  This property is likely to have influenced the evolution 
of a secondary role for gp96 as a molecular warning system for necrotic cell death.[ADDRESS_1089290] with a series of 
receptors, including Toll -like receptors  (TLR)  -2 and TLR -4 on the surface of antigen presenti ng 
cells, and engagement of TLR -2 and -4 provides an adjuvant signal.  Simultaneously, gp96 is able 
to bind to the endocytic scavenger  receptor  (CD91 ) to facilitate internalization of gp96 together 
with whatever protein cargo it bound within the dying cell.  Any antigens brought into an antigen 
presenting cell by [CONTACT_312620]96 are then transferred to MHC I, through the cross -presentation pathway, fo r 
induction of a CD 8 + T-cell-mediated cytotoxic T-cell response.18

  Heat Biologics’ ImPACT  techn ology seeks to replicate this natural mechanism by [CONTACT_790385]96 to become a secretable molecule through the replacement of the KDEL retention signal with 
a secretory sequence from an immunoglobulin molecule.  The resulting gp96 -Ig fusion protein can 
then be transfected into a tumor cell line that contains a profile of antigens that are specific for a 
given tumor type and used to stimulate a CD8 + T-cell response toward those antigens.  In the case 
of HS-110, Heat Biologics has screened a series of NSCLC cell lines to prioritize antigens that are 
known to be shared amongst a high proportion of patients with NSCLC (including MAGE -A3, 
NY-ESO -1, etc.) and selected the AD100 cell line based on these shared antigen expression 
characteristics.  Figure  1 illustrates th at structure of HS-110.

5.5. Prior Human Experience with HS-[ADDRESS_1089291] chemotherapy.  The primary objective of th is study 
was to evaluate the safety o f HS-110 vaccine in patients with advanced NSCLC , and secondary 
objectives were to study the immune response to vaccination, monitor clinical responses, and 
recommend a dose-schedule ( DS) combination for further testing in an initial clinical trial of 
vaccine efficacy.   
A total of 36 patients were to be assig ned to receive HS-110 administered as an intradermal 
injection following one of 3 DS regimens, designed to deliver equivalent numbers of cell s for up 
to 18 weeks . Patients were treated with one of 3 dose-schedule (DS) combinations,    
• DS-1: > 4 × 107 cells every other week for 6 weeks with up to 3 courses and 
9 vaccinations . 
• DS-2: > 2 × 107 cells weekly for 6 weeks with up to 3 courses and 18 vaccinations . 
• DS-3: > 1 × 107 cells twice -weekly for 6 weeks with up to 3 courses and 36 
vaccinations . 
Nineteen  (19) of the planned 36  patients enrolled  in the study ; 1 patient withdrew prior to receiving 
treatment and 18 received study treatment (n=11 patients in DS -1, n=4 patients in DS -2, and n=3 
patients in DS -3). The first 7 patients were enrolled  in th e DS -1 cohort , and those enrolled 
subsequent were assign ed to each of the  DS cohorts in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1089292] point following a strategic decision to focus on further development 
under a commercial Investigational New Drug ( IND) application . Data from this study have been 
published.19 
Four patients died due to  disease progression , and 4 patients reported a total of 6 serious adverse 
events (SAEs), none of which were considered by [CONTACT_300338] -related. Five 
SAEs  were reported by 3 (16.7%) treated patients, which included  rectal hemorrhage, dyspnea, 
chest pain, and lun g infection (pneumonia) , all of which were severe  (Grade 3)  in nature. One of 
these patients also reported a Grade 3 event of  fatigue. The patient who did not receive treatment 
experienced a  SAE  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447] , which resulted in study discontinuat ion.  
The majority of  adverse events ( AEs) were Grade [ADDRESS_1089293] frequent of which were 
induration (n=18, 100%), rash (n=16, 88.9%), pruritus and pain  (n=5 each, 28%).  
Overall,  a total of [ADDRESS_1089294]  been followed for a median 
of 10.6 months (range 2.6 to 16.6).  The Kaplan -Meier estimate of median survival was 8.0 months 
(95% confidence interval [ CI]: 6.7 to 18.2), and the 6, 12, and 24 -month OS rates  were 77.8% 
(95% CI: 51.1 to  91.0%), 41.9% (95% CI: 19.1 to 63.3%), and 11.2% (95% CI: 0.8 to 37.3%), 
respectively.  Although comparison is limited due to incomplete accrual, 2 (0.5%)  patients who 
received weekly vaccines  (DS-2) and 2 (66.7%) of those  receiving vaccine 2 times per wee k (DS-
3) have survived longer than the median survival time of 7.1 months for the 11 patients  who were 
vaccinated every other week (DS -1). Time to progression for DS -2 and DS -3 patients also appears 
to compare favorably with the median progression -free sur vival (PFS) of 1.3 months for DS -1 
patients.  Although there were no objective responses by [CONTACT_119549] (RECIST ) 1.1, 7 of 15 evaluable  patients exhibited stable disease (SD) after a single course 
of therapy; [ADDRESS_1089295] 2 samples (baseline and either week 6, 12 and/or 
18) were available for  15 of the 18 patients on the trial. Peripheral blood samples were collected 
from each patient prior to  treatment and at 6 -, 12-, and 18 -week  time points . Immune response  was 
characterized by [CONTACT_790387] -gamma ( IFNγ ) by [CONTACT_790388]8 + T-cells and assayed by 
[CONTACT_301907] -Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT ). Of the 15 evaluable patients, 11 (73.3%) demonstrated 
a doubling or greater (in some cases upwards of 100 -fold increases) of a CD8 + T-cell-mediated, 
vaccine -specific immune response.  Furthermore, th ere was no increase in CD 4 + T-cell-mediated 
immunity by [CONTACT_15236], confirming preclinical findings that the effect of the gp96 -Ig approach  is 
limited to CD8 + cytotoxic T -cell responses.  When the survival of the immune responders (11/15 
patients , 73.3% ) was  compared to that of the non -responders (4/15 , 26.7% ), it was observed that 
the immune responder OS was 16.[ADDRESS_1089296] s hown that the combination of PD -1 blockade and gp96 -Ig vaccination  results 
in a potent increase in the number of CD 8 + cytotoxic T-cells.20  Emerging data f rom the ongoing 
DURGA trial show s increased TIL after HS-110 vaccine. Th us, combining HS-110 with anti -PD-1 
agents may enhance the vaccine’s anti -tumor activity while prolonging or increasing the efficacy 
of the checkpoint inhibitor.  
HS-[ADDRESS_1089297] range of NSCLC tumor antigens 
combined with a specific mechanism for the transport of these antigens to patient 
antigen -presenting cells for the generation of a specific CD8 + cytotoxic T-cell response. It is, 
therefo re, likely that HS-110 will represent a more effective antigenic stimulus than many other 
existing vaccine constructs.  
HS-110 is based on Heat Biologic s’ ImPACT™ technology, a gp96 -Ig fusion protein expression 
construct, which when expressed, leads to the secretion of gp96 -bound cellular specific antigens. 
The backbon e cell line for HS-110, AD100, was selected based on its antigenic profile which 
overlap s with the antigenic profiles in a large  proportion of NSCLC patient tumor samples. 
Extracellular gp96 activates a CD8 + T-cell mediated immune response in [ADDRESS_1089298] manners: 1) 
by [CONTACT_790389] (DC) via  TLR -2 and TLR -4 and 2) by 
[CONTACT_790390]8 + T-Cells via the endocytic 
scavenger receptor, CD91. These characteristics make gp96 unique because it can both activate 
and deliver chaperoned antigens by [CONTACT_790391] ( APC ) to MHC I in order to elicit a 
CD8 + T-cell mediated immune response. A comparison of our ImPACT  approach to other vaccine

Thus , the rationale for the evaluation of HS-110 in combination with multiple immune modulating 
strategies is as follows:  
• Recent and paradigm -changing clinical data support the feasibility of effective NSCLC 
immunotherapy when  NSCLC cells become susceptible to attack by [CONTACT_28746] T 
lymphocytes (CTL).  
• Secret ed gp96 -Ig from HS-110 combines immune adjuvant activity with polyvalent 
peptide specificity , activat ing DC, NK cel ls, and CTL s, and result ing in death of tumor 
cells by [CONTACT_790392] -specific mechanisms and by [CONTACT_145155] -restricted CD8  + CTL activity.  The 
activation of DC and NK cells by [CONTACT_156889]-[ADDRESS_1089300] the generation of 
immunosuppressive T -regs.  
• This master protocol design facilitates t he testing of novel combinations of 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a small number of patients in order to characterize the safety  
profile and immune response to advanc e promising new combination regimens into 
larger  expansion cohorts . 
• The combination of HS-[ADDRESS_1089301]  further  activation and clonal expansion of antigen -specific and 
activated CD8  + T-cells, leading to a higher quality immune response of TIL. 
6.2. Justification of HS-110 Dose Selection  
As indicated in the initial phase 1 investigator -sponsored trial ( IST), the weekly (2 × 107 cells) and 
twice weekly (1 × 107 cells) dosing schedules were determined to produce the most desirable 
immune response (at least a doubling of CD8 + numbers from baseline).  The weekly dosing 
regimen  was selected for this trial as a starting point, as it represents the schedule with greatest 
patient acceptability for frequency of treatment visits.  Further, the choice of the  lower dose is 
prudent from a safety perspective as this trial is th e first test ing HS-[ADDRESS_1089302] that lower doses may produce sufficient immune response with possibly  
superior clinical effects.21 Speci fically, the murine dose -ranging studies indicated that production 
Heat Biologics, Inc.   Viagenpumatucel -L 
Protocol HS110 -102  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 
Amendment 6, 24 May 2019   Page 31 of 95 
  of approximately 400 ng gp96 -Ig per million cells (15-20 micrograms [mcg] per kg on a weight 
basis ) provided the optimal dose.  Production of approximately 5 -10 mcg gp96 -Ig per million cells  
(1-2.5 mcg per kg on a weight basis ) in a macaque dose -ranging study provided the optimal dose.  
Thus, there is not an expectation of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_107382] -escalation in larger mammals as is anticipated 
for most antibodies or small molecules where receptor satura tion is predictive of efficacy.  In the 
case of HS-110, no significant difference in immune response was detected between the [ADDRESS_1089303]  appropriate for this  phase 1b combinati on study.  
The selection of the multi -injection intradermal route of administration for HS-110 is based on the 
hypothesis that split doses stimulate stronger immune responses by [CONTACT_790393] (where immune resp onses are generated).  The vaccine will be 
administered intradermally to enhance stimulation of cellular immune responses as compared to 
subcutaneous or intramuscular immunization.  
6.3. Rationale for Obtaining Archival Tissue and Performing Tumor 
Biopsies  
In ord er for an allogeneic cell -based vaccine to elicit  to a clinical response, it must not only 
stimulate a tumor -antigen -specific immune response as detected by [CONTACT_790394], but those lymphocytes must also infiltrate the tumor microenvironment.  A 
respon se to HS-110 is expected in patients  whose tumors express antigens that overlap with the  
antigens contained within the AD100 cell backbone of HS-110. In addition, the response of 
patients with tumors that express numerous  antigens shared with HS-110 is expected to  surpass 
the response of those with tumors that only share 1 or 2 antigens with HS-110. Furthermore, 
clinical response to HS-110 may be predicted by [CONTACT_790395]8 + T-cells. Thus, a rchival or fresh biopsy tissue will be obtained  for pre -treatment tumor 
analysis , and a fresh biopsy sample should  be collected  for post -treatment analysis  when feasible  
(unless written authorization from the Sponsor is obtained) .  
6.4. Rationale for Inclusion of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients  
While the AD 100 line selected for HS -110 was deriv ed from adenocarcinoma, an example of 
evaluating upregulated gene expression between NSCLC a deno carcinoma and s quamous cell 
carcinoma  has been depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393]  (Figure 2) showing overlap of 14 antigens between 
adenocarcinoma tumor bank data and HS -110, and an overlap of 10 antigens between squamous 
cell carcinoma  tumor bank antigen expression  and HS -110. Thus, m ultiple shared antigens 
between HS -110 and squamous cell carc inoma support the rationale for inclusion of squamous cell 
carcinoma patients in this clinical trial.

Figure 2 : HS-110 was derived from AD100 cell line from adenocarcinoma; HS -[ADDRESS_1089304] -line treatment in 
NSCLC in patients with ≥ 50% PD -L1 expression. It has shown an improvement in ORR, but there 
are still patients that have PD. This is an area of unmet need and response rates to additional 
check point inhibitors  in the second and third line , specifically monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such 
as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab  are unknown .  
Combining HS-110 with anti -PD-1 agents may enhance the vaccine’s anti -tumor activity while 
prolonging or increasing the efficacy of the checkpoint  inhibitor. The combination of HS-[ADDRESS_1089305] s hown 
that the combination of PD -1 blockade and gp96 -Ig vaccination results in a potent increase in the 
number of CD 8 + cytotoxic T-cells.[ADDRESS_1089306] line maintenance phase run the risk of disease progression, some of which can be 
attributed to the continuous generation of exhausted and inadequate numbers of tumor specific 
effector T cells. The goal of adding HS-110 along with PD -1/L1 blockade in the maintenance 
phase is to ensure a higher probability that tumor growth will be controlled by [CONTACT_790396]8 + T cells, and rescue of this activated CD8 + T cells from 
exhaustion. Many patients fail to receive  second -line therapy due to rapid progression of disease, 
decrease in their performance status, or increase cancer -related symptoms. By [CONTACT_790397]-[ADDRESS_1089307] line therapy, the window 
of opp ortunity for immune driven treatment benefit may be augmented and extended. Exhausted 
tumor specific T cells maybe refractory or resistant to complete rescue by [CONTACT_4002] -1 blockade therapy 
alone and require additional activation and expansion of new tumor specif ic sets of CD8 + T cells. 
It can therefore be surmised that concomitant dosage of HS-[ADDRESS_1089308] line maintenance phase until progression can ensure an ongoing and expanded adaptive 
immune response as opposed to CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790362].

  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study  Design  
This is a master protocol, intended to evaluate multiple immune modulation strategies in 
combination with HS-110; subsequent treatment arms will be added by [CONTACT_790398][INVESTIGATOR_790355]. Patients will be assigned to treatment arms based on 
the fit to eligibility criteria.  
As of Amendment 4, the Phase 1b portion of the trial (consisting of the first 15 patients to receive 
HS-110 in combination with nivolumab) is com plete . Subsequent patients and cohorts will be 
considered Phase 2.  Treatment Arm 1 (HS -110 plus oxygen, n=1 patient) has been discontinued. 
Patients in previously designated Arms 2, 3, and 4 all received HS -110 + nivolumab but had 
different TIL status.  Pa tients from these arms have now been reclassified as Arm 5, and further 
enrollment into this arm is ongoing.   
As of Amendment 5, the patient population under study will be expanded to include front  line 
patients who have received immunotherapy (with or wi thout chemotherapy), who have not 
progressed clinically or radiographically (per RECIST 1.1)  at the most recent imaging assessment , 
and who will begin maintenance immunotherapy with SOC pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed.  HS-
[ADDRESS_1089309] be initiated on or before 
maintenance cycle 3 (after completion of platinum chemotherapy ), or no later than week 19 (if 
receiving front line pembrolizumab monotherapy).  
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled to the below treatment arm s and cohorts 
(n=120) :  
Arm 5  HS-110 plus SOC nivolumab  (n=100, to include 15 phase 1b patients and 85 phase 2 
patients).   
Arm 6  HS-110 plus SOC pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed (n=up to 20 phase 2 patients).  
Arm 5 p atients will receive a combination of weekly HS-110 administered as 5  intradermal 0.1  mL 
injections at a dose of 1 × 1 07 viable cells/ 0.[ADDRESS_1089310]. After completion of 18 weeks of combination therapy, patie nts may receive either nivolumab 
dosing schedule listed in the package insert  (every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks)  per Investigator 
discretion .  
Arm 5 patients will be scanned radiographically at Screening, Week 9, Week 18, and every 8 
weeks thereafter until c onfirmed disease progression . 
Arm 6 patients will receive a combination of weekly HS-110 administered as 5  intradermal 0.1  mL 
injections at a dose of 1 × 107 viable cells/ 0.5 mL for 1 3 weeks in combination with SOC 
pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed every [ADDRESS_1089311] ing every 3 weeks in combination with SOC 
pembrolizumab or SOC pembrolizumab/pemetrexed until con firmed disease progression  or 
unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first .

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019   Page 35 of 95 
  Arm 6 patients will be scanned radiographically at Screening and every 9 weeks thereafter until 
confirmed disease progression . 
For all study patients , the scan schedule will continue until  confirmed disease progression  (iCPD) 
as defined by [CONTACT_19393] , after which they will be followed for OS. Using the principles of iRECIST, 
patients with unconfirmed disease progression (iUPD) should continue on study treatment until 
confirmed pr ogression (iCPD) unless clinical progression necessitates otherwise.  
For all study patients, screening tumor samples (archival or fresh) and on -treatment biopsy tumor 
samples  (when feasible to obtain)  will be screened for expression of immune active cell subsets 
and molecules, expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells  and evaluation for the presence of TILs . Pre- 
and post -treatment TIL  and PD-L1 levels with be correlated with clinical outcomes.  
Peripheral b lood samples will be taken to evaluate tumor mutatio n burden and immune cell subsets  
for correlation with clinical outcomes.  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_790399] (AEs), evaluation of clinical laboratory 
parameters (hematology, liver function, electrolytes, troponin, and renal function), vi tal signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical exams (PEs).  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_790400], ORR,  DOR , DCR, DRR  and PFS by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 . 
The overall study design is summarized below in Figure  3.

  complete, after which nivolumab may be administered either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks (per 
Investigator’s discretion) in accordance with the current approved nivolumab  Package Insert .  
Patients enrolled in Arm 6  will receive HS-110 plus SOC pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed. HS-110 
will be administered concomitantly with maintenance pembrolizumab +/ - pemetrexed. HS-110 0.5 
mL will be administered intradermally as weekly injection s for 13 weeks , followed by 0.5 mL 
intradermal injections every 3 weeks . Treatment with HS-110 and pembrolizumab +/ - pemetrexed 
will continue  until confirmed disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first . 
Patients’ participation in this study may continue 2 years or longer . The duration of the nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab, and pembrolizumab/pemetrexed  treatments are standard of care (SOC) and will 
continue along with radiology scans until confirmed disease progr ession or unacceptable toxicity. 
Following confirmed disease progression , patients will be followed by [CONTACT_790401] 3 months .

Protocol HS110 -102  CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 56 of 95  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_790365].  Other than protocol -defined agents, n o concomitant 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, immunosuppressive or other anticancer therapy will be permitted 
while receiving study treatme nts. 
Administration of other concomitant investigational agents, for any indication, is not permitted 
while on this study.  
During survival  follow -up there are no prohibited medications, and patients may enroll in any 
investigational study for which they ar e eligible.  
 Supportive Care  
Patients should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of blood and 
blood products; treatment with antibiotics, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and analgesics; and other 
care as deemed appropriate and  in accordance with their institutional guidelines.  
11.4. Treatment of Investigational Product Overdose  
There have been no cases o f overdose with HS-110. Treatment of any suspected or confirme d 
overdose with HS-110 should be symptomatic, and supportive care is r ecommended in cases where 
overdose is suspected.  As described in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for HS-110, the Sponsor 
does not recommend specific treatment for overdose or toxicity; however, the  Investigator should 
use appropriate clinical judgment in treating the overdose.  For the purposes of this study,  an 
overdose of HS-110 is defined as any dose 50% greater than the intended dose for that patient.  
Appropriate supportive care measures may need to be provided to address these potential toxicities 
in the event of an overdose.  
11.5. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Any Grade 3  or higher AE determined to be treatment -related (HS-110 and/or nivolumab  and/or 
pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed ) will be discussed with the Medical Monitor before continuing with 
dosing, with the following exceptions:  
• Local injection site reactions lasting <72 hours, including pain, redness, swelling, 
induration, or pruritus  
• Systemic injection reactions lasting < 72 hours of fever, myalgia, headache, or fatigue  
• For patients in Treatment Arm 5: known and manageable reactions considered 
“expected” with nivolumab per the package insert  
• For patients in Treatment Arm 6: known and manageable reactions considered 
“expected”  with pembrolizumab and/or  pemetrexed per the package inserts.  
Where judged appropriate by [CONTACT_737] (after discussion with the Medical Monitor) a dose 
delay may be necessary for ≥ Grade 3 AEs until resolution of the toxicity ( to Grade 1 or less).  
HS-110: No dose m odifications of HS-110 will be permitted.  
Nivolumab , pembrolizumab  and pemetrexed : Dose modifications are permitted according to 
their package insert s. If nivolumab , pemb rolizumab  and/or pemetrexed  is discontinued due to 
toxicity, patients may continue to receive HS-110. This approach is consistent with results showing

Safety data will be collected  throughout the study by a qualified physician, physician assistant, or 
nursing staff.  Measurements used to evaluate safety will include medical history, physical 
examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and evaluation of  AEs.  AEs will be  graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03) .22 
Clinically significant abnorma l laboratory parameters  (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) may be 
repeated.  If warranted, additional or more frequent testing than is specified in the protocol if 
warranted by [CONTACT_790410].  
13.1. Physical Examination  
PEs must be performed by a qualified physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant and 
should include a thoro ugh review of all body systems at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1) and at the 
EOT  Visit . Body systems to be evaluated include Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat (HEENT), 
Pulmonary, Cardiovascular, Musculoskeletal, Abdominal/Gastrointestinal, Lymphatic, 
Neurolo gical, Dermatologic, and Genito -urinary systems . In addition, the full PE will include

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 60 of 95  13.3. Injection Site Reactions  
The grading scale for injection site reactions ( ISRs ) used in this trial can be found in Appendix 2 . 
Grade 1 ISRs consisting of mild redness, erythema, and swelling around the injection site are 
anticipated.  Grade 1 reactio ns should dissipate over several days to a week with no special 
treatment.  All ISRs , regardless of grade,  should be recorded on the Injection Site Reaction CRF 
page , including a photograph of each reaction where feasible . If an unusual , Grade 3 , or Grade 4 
ISR occurs, attempts to obtain photographs at initial report  and at follow -up visits, which show 
resolution over time, are encouraged.  A ruler should be in the field of view to allow measurement 
of the size of the reaction.  De-identified photograph( s) should be appended to the CRF.  
13.4. Cardiac Monitoring  
Troponin I or T and ECGs will be used in the first month of the study to monitor for signs of 
immune -related cardiotoxicity  as per Table  2. The following actions should be taken in the event 
of changes in cardiac monitoring tests:  
- Isolated  Troponin I or T elevation:   
o Delay HS -110 and additional study drug treatment  (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or 
pembrolizumab /pemetrexed) . 
o Assess patient for new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea (shortness 
of breath when lying down) , or syncope . 
o Perform ECG and ECHO to  evaluate for new evidence of heart block , reduction in 
LVEF , pericardial effusion, or other abnormalities.   
o Repeat Troponin I or T in 2-[ADDRESS_1089361] developed and/or repeat troponin remains elevated (above 
upper limit of normal per institution), consider discontinuation of therapy and 
cardiology cons ultation.  In this event contact [CONTACT_790411] . 
o If Troponin decreases with no other clinically significant findings, treatment can be 
restarted  after discussion and approval by M edical Monitor.  
- ECG evidence of heart block:  
o Delay HS -110 and additional study drug treatment  (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or 
pembrolizumab /pemetrexed) .  
o Assess patient for new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea (shortness 
of breath when lying down), and syncope.  
o Perform ECHO to evaluate for reduction  (> 10% reduction from baseline or below 
lower limit of normal per institution)  in LVEF, pericardial effusion, or other 
abnormalities.   
o Repeat ECG in [ADDRESS_1089362] developed and/or repeat ECG remains abnormal consider 
discontinuation of therapy and cardiology consultation.  In this event contact [CONTACT_790412].

Protocol HS110 -[ADDRESS_1089363] performed 
at the Screening and Baseline  Visits. 
Female patients who become pregnant during the study should discontinue study medication 
immediately.  The patient will receive counseling from the Investigator or designee regarding the 
nature of the study medication and the potential risk on fetal development.   
 Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information  
All pregnancy information should be collected  from the time of Screening Visit (up to Day -28 
prior to study drug a dministration ) to [ADDRESS_1089364] dose of study medication.  Patients with  
pregnancies identified during screening will be recorded as screen failures.  
 Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor, or designee, within 24 hours  of learning of a patient’s 
pregnancy.  The patient will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Information on the status of the mother and child wil l be forwarded to the Sponsor, or designee.  
Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  
Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or  SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons w ill be recorded a s an AE or SAE (see AE 
and SAE Section 15.1). 
A spont aneous abortion after the first trimester will be reported as an SAE.  Furthermore, any SAE 
occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy and that is considered reasonably related to the 
study drug by [CONTACT_78795].  Whil e the Investigator is not 
obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an 
SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
 Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs in a Female Partner of a Male Study 
Subject  
The Investig ator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male study patient’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while participating in this study.  The Investigator will record 
pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor, o r designee, within 
24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  The partner will also be followed to determine the 
outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor or designee.  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the 
estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.

14.1. Tumor Assessments  
Tumor response assessments will incorporate results from radiographic tumor assessment (CT 
scans or MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as physical examination, where 
appropriate, and will follow RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_1089365] or MRI  will be documented at Screening , 
and repeat scans will be performed at Week 9, Week 18 and then every 8 weeks thereafter (Arm 
5), or at Screening and every  9 weeks (Arm 6) until confirmed iCPD per iRECIST , unless clinical 
signs of progression necessitate earlier scanning.  
The same method used at Screening must be used throughout the study  whenever possible . Bone 
scans are NOT acceptable for determination of disease status, and suspected bone lesions must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI.  PET scanning is strongly discouraged for the purposes of disease 
evaluation, and any proposed use should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to baseline 
scanning.  
 RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1089366]  for Tumor Assessment  
At the baseline tumor assessment, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable 
or non -measurable with measurable tumor lesions recorded according to the longest diameter in 
the p lane of measurement (except for pathological lymph nodes, which are measured in the shortest 
axis).  When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representat ive of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions.  For the purposes of this study, a maximum of 2 lymph nodes are 
permitted as target lesions, irrespective of the organ systems from which they originate.  Target 
lesions should be selected on  the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter).  A sum of 
the diameters for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.   
Radiographic assessment (CT scan or MRI) will be performed as follows:  
Arm 5:  Screen ing, W eek 9, Week 18, and every 8 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease 
progression;  
Arm 6:  Screening and e very 9 weeks until confirmed disease progression  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified  as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present ,’ ‘absent ,’ or ‘unequivocal progression .’  
Disease response  via RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_1089367] 1.1 
progression is followed at the next assessment by [CONTACT_54079] . This approach allows atypi[INVESTIGATOR_648901], such as delayed responses that occur after pseudoprogression, to be identified, further 
understood, and better characterized.  Refer to Appendix  3 for further details.

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 63 of 95  The disease response measures will allow for the calculation of the ORR, PFS, and DCR. T he 
ORR includes CR /iCR, and PR/iPR. PFS is the time between treatment  assignment and the date 
of PD /iPD or death, whichever comes first. The DCR  includes responses of  PR/iPR, CR/iCR or 
SD/iSD.  
14.2. Immunologic Response  (IR) 
Peripheral blood samples  (50 mL) will be collected at Screening ,Week 7, Week 13, and EOT . All 
samples will be shipped to and processed by [CONTACT_790413], Inc . or its designee.  
Forty (40) mL heparinized blood and 10 mL of non -heparinized blood will be drawn at each of the 
above time point s and used for analysis as outlined  below . PBMCs will be isolated from 
heparinized blood samples by [CONTACT_790414].  Isolated PBMCs will be utilized for 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_790367] (FACS) and 
ELISPOT  assays  as described below.  A subset of isolated PBMCs will by [CONTACT_790415]. Serum collected from 
non-heparinized blood samples will be stored for batch analysis of antibody titers to HLA -A1, in 
non-HLA -A1 positive patients and serum cytokines/chemokines.  
In addition to the analyses specified below, subsequent exploratory mechanistic analyses, the 
nature of which will be determined by [CONTACT_790416] - and post -study treatment, may also be performed.  
14.3. Production of Interferon -gamma and Granzyme B from PBMCs  
(ELISPOT)  
The immune response will be evaluated by [CONTACT_488] -specific ELISPOT analysis for IFNγ and 
Granzyme B production by  [CONTACT_790417]. These ELISPOT  assays will be conducted in our research 
facility .  
Previously cryopreserved and thawed PBMCs will be challenged or restimulated with specific 
tumor vaccine antigens as follows:  
• PBMC s + PMA + Ionomycin (positive control) . 
• PBMC s + HS-110 whole cell lysates  
• PBMC s + a n overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_790368], which may include 
Survivin, TTK, NY -ESO -1, CEP55, MAGEA1, MAGEA3, MAGEA6, MAGEA 12, 
MAGEB1, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, CXORF61, GAGE1, BAGE1, CTCFL, DDX43, 
SSX1, SSX4, and HORMAD  1. 
For the ELISPOT assay, the frozen PBMCs will be thawed, antigen challenged, and plated for 
analysis of IFNγ  and GzB production by [CONTACT_790418] y and analyzed in 
duplicate  per time point  for each patient.  Following incubation, samples  will be quantitated in an 
automated ELISPOT reader.  
The frequency of IFN  producing PBMC  is thought to mirror the fr equency of cytotoxic CD8 + 
cells; h owever, cytotoxicity is primarily mediated by [CONTACT_790419].  In some instances , IFNγ secretion and granule exocytosis are uncoupled.  Therefore, 
the direct measurement of gzB secretion by [CONTACT_790420] a more direct readout for

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 64 of 95  antigen -specific granule exocytosis and cytotoxicity.  Antigen specificit y of the ELISPOT  response 
will be evalua ted by [CONTACT_790421].  This will also enable separation of the 
‘allo-antigen’ specific response with the po tential parent cell line tumor antigen -specific response.  
Positive responses will be defined as a greater than two -fold increase in the number of 
IFNγ -positive PBMC  compared to baseline.  
14.4. Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_790369] (CD4 5 +), B-cells (CD4 5 +, CD3 -, CD19 +), helper T -cells 
(CD4 5 +, CD3 +, CD4 +), T-cells (CD4 5 +, CD3 +, CD8 +), regulatory T -cells (CD 3 +, CD4+, CD25+, 
FoxP3 +), and NK cells (CD4 5 +, CD56 +, CD3 -) at baseline and over the course of therapy. In 
addition, a NK/T-cell activation panel (Ki67,  CD137, CD27, CD28 ), memory panel (CD27, Cd28, 
CD45 RA, CD197, CD57) and exhaustion panel (CTLA4, PD -1, Tim3, TIGIT)  will be performed.  
14.5. Analysis of Infiltrating T -Cells (Post -Treatment Tumor Biopsy)  
Post-treatment biopsies will be collected at week 10, when feasible , and the tissue will be examined 
for the presence of TILs.  Multicolor  fluorescence immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be used for 
quantification of infiltrating CD3+, CD4+  and FOXP3+  T-cells and measurement o f their 
activation status , Ki67  and PD -1 expression , and cytotoxic activity ( gzB expression) in situ.  These 
data will be correlated with clinical response.  
14.6. Tumor Mutation Burden Analysis  
Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB ) is the number of coding somatic base substitution and indel 
mutations occurring in a tumor specimen, per megabase (Mb) of coding genome assessed.

15.1. Adverse and S erious Adverse Events  
All patients will be assessed for pre -existing symptoms during screening (from the date of 
signature [CONTACT_790442]).  Symptoms will be documented 
as AEs from the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_1089371] dose of study drug  (EOT ) or 
until death, whichever occurs first.  Any AEs occurring after this time period will also be reported, 
if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the event is deemed related to study drug.  All AEs will be 
followed until the event has resolved  or, in the case of permanent impairment, until the condi tion 
stabilizes.  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol.  During the study when there is a 
safety evaluation, the Investigator or site s taff will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting AEs and SAEs . 
 Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a medicinal product in 
humans, whether or not considered related to the medicinal produc t (Code of Federal Regulati ons 
(CFR) Title 21 part 312.32 [a] ). Note: an AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.  For marketed medicinal products, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. , lack of efficacy), abuse, or misuse.  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is defined as any AE for which there is reasonable possibility 
that t he dru g caused the AE (21 CFR 312.32 [a] ). 
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the curre nt application (21 CFR 312.32 [a] ). 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
The CFR Title 21 part 312.32 and ICH Guideline for Industry: Clini cal Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH -E2a March 1995, as implemented by [CONTACT_206870], defines a SAE or serious adverse drug experience as any untoward medical occurrence 
that at any dose:  
• Results in death (i.e., t he AE actually causes or leads to death) . 
• Is life -threatening (with regards to determining if an AE is serious, “life -threatening” 
is defined as an AE for which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  
It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.  If either the investigator or the  Sponsor believes  that an AE meets the 
definition of life -threatening, it will be considered life -threatening) . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
Heat Biologics, Inc.    Viagenpumatucel -L 
Protocol HS110 -102  CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 66 of 95  • Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Results in any “other” important medical event.  Medical or scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as 
important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospit alization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronc hospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 Disease -Related Events or Outcomes not Qualifying as SAEs  
An event that is part of the natural course of the disease under stu dy (i.e. , disease progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE.  Death due to disease progression is to be recorded on the 
“Death ” CRF page and not as a SAE; h owever, if the progression of the underlying disease is 
greater than what would normally be expec ted for the patient, or if the Investigator considers that 
there was a causal relationship between treatment with study drug or protocol design/procedures 
and the disease progression, then it must be reported as an SAE.  Any new primary cancer must be 
repor ted as an SAE.  
 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as AEs 
and SAEs  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry and hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g., vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_152391]  (CS) will 
be recorded as AEs and SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE.  CS abnormal laboratory 
findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline 
and significantly worsen f ollowing the start of the study will be reported as A Es or SAEs;  however, 
abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease 
being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_54766]’s 
condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be 
reported as AEs or SAEs.  
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory find ing or other abnormal assessment is CS. 
15.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator , or other qualified physician designee,  will assess the possible relationship 
between the AE/SAE and any of the study medications, as well as any concomitant medications 
according to the following criteria:  
• Related: AE and administration of one or more study products are related in time, and 
AE is explained by [CONTACT_790422].  
• Not related: AE is explained by [CONTACT_790423].

15.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will record all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_790424].  In addition, each study patient will be questioned about any AEs they have 
experienced during each study visit . 
Each AE should be described in detail in the patient’s medical record and on the “Adverse Event ”

Any oral report of SAEs must be followed within [ADDRESS_1089373] be submitted as soon as reasonably possible . The 
Sponsor will promptly report SAEs related to HS-110 or additional study drug to the FDA and 
other applicable regulator y agencies in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 and local regulatory 
requirements.  The Investigator should also comply with any applicable requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the IRB/EC.  
The Medical Monitor will review each SAE report and evaluate  the relationship of the SAE to 
study treatment and to underlying disease.  Based on the Investigator’s and Medical Monitor ’s 
(Sponsor’s ) assessment of the SAE, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action.  
The primary consideration govern ing further action is whether new findings affect the safety of 
patients participating in the clinical study.  If the discovery of a new  SAE related to HS-110 and/or 
additional study drug raises concern over the safety of continued administration of study d rug to 
patients, the Sponsor will take immediate steps to notify the FDA and all Investigators participating 
in clin ical studies of HS-110. 
Further action that may be required includes the following:  
• Modification of the protocol . 
• Discontinuation or suspens ion of the study . 
• Modification of the existing consent form and informing current study participants of 
new findings . 
• Addition of any n ewly identified HS-[ADDRESS_1089374] of expected AEs to 
the Investigator’s Brochure . 
15.5. Study Review Committee and  Data Monitoring Committee  
In the phase 1b portion of the study, a Study Review Committee provided ongoing safety 
evaluations and recommendation for advancement into phase 2. Moving forward,  a fully 
constituted and independent  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review ongoing safety and  
efficacy  of phase 2 patients . A full description of the membership, roles, and responsibilities of the 
DMC will be outlined in a separate charter.  
Ad-hoc meetings will also occur if the S ponso r, Medical Monitor, or Investigator believes a safety 
issue has arisen during the course of the trial that may warrant further review or trial alteration.

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 69 of 95  16. STATISTICS  
16.1. General Statistical Considerations  
Patients will be analyzed according to the following cohorts for Arm 5:  
• Cohort A, composed of all CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve patients  (n=40 , including 15 phase 1b patients ).   
• Cohort B, composed of all CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790356] (n=60). Note that this cohort will be 
permitted to over -enroll.  
Patients will be analyzed according the following cohorts for Arm 6. Distribution will not be 
controlled  within the two cohorts  (n=up to 20  based on patient availability ): 
• Cohort C, composed of all patients receiving maintenance p embrolizumab  
• Cohort D, composed of all patients receiving maintenance pembrolizumab + pemetrexed  
Each cohort (A, B, C and D) will be analyzed including patients  of all histolog y types , and then 
again including only adenocarcinoma patients.  
Analyses will be  performed within each of the cohorts to identify differences in strata for each of 
the following factors  if sufficient data exists : 
• Histology: a denocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma  
• PD-L1 status : negative ( <1% ) and positive (≥1%) based on tumor cell expression  
• TIL status : high (> 10%) and low (≤ 10%)  
• Tumor Mutation Burden : high (10 or more mutations) and low (less than 10 mutations)  
Additional factors, such as line of treatment or presence of injection site reactions, may be added 
to statistical model s used for analyses;  the method of pooling and testing for interaction among the 
different factors will be described in detail in the SAP.   
The intent of this clinical investigation is to establish the ORR and quantify the duration of PFS 
across the various subsets in NSCLC patients who receive HS -110.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentage of 
patients) , while  continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_790425] (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum). All binary clinical endpoints such as immune 
response, DCR and ORR will be presented as point estimates with 95% CI for each cohort. Time -
to-event endpoints (PFS, OS) will be calculat ed using Kaplan -Meier methodology.  
TEAEs will be summarized in an overall summary of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) , 
as well as tables summarized all TEAEs (by [CONTACT_3592]), TEAEs related to HS-110, TEAEs 
related to the combination therapy (nivo lumab, pembro lizumab , or pembrolizumab /pem etrexed , 
serious TEAEs, serious TEAEs related to the combination therapy, and grade 3+ TEAEs.  Listings 
of all TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation will also be presented.  
16.2. Sample Size  
Within Arm 5, Cohorts A and B are planned to enroll 40 and 60 patients , respectively . Note that 
Cohort B will be permitted to over -enroll based on patient availability. The phase 1b patients

Protocol HS110 -102  CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 70 of 95  (n=15) will be included in the sample size for Cohort A. The distributio n of patients, relative to 
enrollment, will not be controlled  within Arm 6 (Cohorts C and D) but is planned to be up to 20 
total based on patient availability . Response will be summarized for various combinations of 
factors in an exploratory manner.   With a total enrollment into this clinical investigation of up to 
120 patients, this study should provide sufficient precision to provide a characterization of the 
likely efficacy subsets to be used in a larger study.  
16.3. Analysis Populations  
Study populations are defined as follows:   
Safety Population :  defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of HS -110.

18.1. Study M onitoring  
In accordance with applicable regulations and GCP, the S ponsor will perform quality control and 
assurance checks.  Before enrolling any patient into this study, the S ponsor (or designees) will 
review the protocol, the IB, draft  CRFs and instructio ns for their completion, and significant 
protocol sections  (i.e. reporting AEs and SAEs ) with  the Investigator . A qualified designee of the 
Sponsor will monitor the conduct of the study at reasonable intervals by [CONTACT_414374] /or by 
[CONTACT_790431] e -mail. 
The Investigator agrees that qualified representatives of the Sponsor and regulatory agencies will 
have, both during and after this study, direct access to review medical records pertinent to the 
clinical study as specified  by [CONTACT_19124].  Patients will not be identified by [CONTACT_790432], and confidentiality of information in both study and medical records will be 
preserved to the extent that  is required by [CONTACT_19124].  
The Sponsor will monitor the  study consistent with the demands of the study and site activity to 
ensure  that the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate, and complete;  
• Safety and rights of patients are being protected;  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol , any other 
study agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
18.2. Protocol Deviations  
In general, a protocol deviation is an inadvertent excursion from  or non -compliance with the 
IRB/EC -approved protocol.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in 
accordance with the protocol and should not implement any changes to the protocol unless it is 
required to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patient.  
If the deviation affects the safety or the rights of the patient, th e Sponsor must be notified 
immediately.  Other deviations outside of these categories will be reported to the IRB/EC in 
accordance with local requirements, as applicable.  Deviations that fall into the following 
categories will be captured on the CRFs  for in clusion in the CSR : 
• Entered into the study without meeting eligibility criteria . 
• Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn . 
• Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose . 
• Received excluded concomitant treatment . 
• Failed to collect data essential  to the interpret ation of  primary endpoints  for the study .

TUMORS (RECIST  1.1) GUIDELINES  AND GUIDLELINES FOR  
RESPONSE CRITERIA FO R USE IN TRIALS TEST ING 
IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS ( IRECIST)  
 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1089393] 1.1 is derived from time -point response assessments 
based on tumor burden as follows below.  
Evaluation of target lesions:  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of  target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of 1 or 
more new lesions is also considered progression).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient sh rinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
Evaluation of non -target lesions:  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor  marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size ( < 10mm short 
axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. 
(Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression).

CR = C omplete Response, P R = Partial Response, S D = Stable Disease, P D = Progressive Disease, N E = Not Evaluable  
When target lesions show SD/PR and some subset of non -target lesions are considered not 
evaluable , a careful decision must be made whether to call the overall response at this time point 
SD/PR or NE.  This is based on whether the lesions that are not evaluable , if they showed growth, 
could cause an overall response of PD in the context of the other lesion responses seen. If the 
non-target lesions  that are not eva luable  comprise a significant proportion of the overall disease 
burden, the appropriate time point response is NE.  
 
* Please refer to the complete New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST 
guidelines – version 1.[ADDRESS_1089394] defines unconfirmed progress (iUPD) on the basis of RECIST 1.1 principles; however, 
iUPD requires confirmation  on repeat imaging no less than 4  weeks later , which is done on the 
basis of observing either a further increase in size (or in the number of new lesions) in the lesion 
category in which progression was first identified in ( i.e., target or non -target disease), or 
progression (defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) in lesion categories that had not previously met RECIST 1.1 
progression criteria. However, if progression is not confirmed, but instead tumor shrinkage occurs 
(compared with baseline), which meets the criteria of iCR, iPR, or iSD, then the bar is reset so that 
iUPD needs  to occur again (compared with nadir values) and then be confirmed (by [CONTACT_648940]) 
at the next assessment for iCPD to be assigned. If no change in tumor size or extent from iUPD 
occurs, then the time point response would again be iUPD. This approach allows atypi[INVESTIGATOR_648901], such as delayed resp onses that occur after pseudoprogression, to be identified, further 
understood, and better characterized.  
 
Heat Biologics, Inc.    Viagenpumatucel -L 
Protocol HS110 -[ADDRESS_1089395]. If a new lesion is 
identified (thus meeting the criteria for iUPD) and the pati ent is clinically stable, treatment should 
be continued. New lesions should be assessed and categorized as measurable or non -measurable 
using RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1089396] time point  response, the next time point  response is dependent on the status of all 
lesions, including target, non -target, new lesion target, and new lesion non -target; on whether any 
increase in size has occurred (either a further i ncrease in size or a sufficient increase to assign a 
new iUPD if the criteria were not previously met); or the appearance of additional new lesions.

Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 88 of 95  APPENDIX 4: AMENDMENT  JUSTIFICATION  AND  CHANGE  LOG 
Amendment 6 Justification  
Amendment 6 is designed to provide clarification and improve ease of operationalization of 
Amendment 5 across multiple sites with differing practices of front -line patient management. In 
general, the timing to initiate additive HS -110 to front line maintenance will be restricted by [CONTACT_790435]/or cycles  rather than  be tethered to the timing of imaging scans. Amendment 6 also clarifies 
that the primary endpoint of PFS added in Amendment 5 only applies to the newly added Arm 6 
cohorts in front -line maintenance; original Arm 5 patients (Cohorts A & B) will retain the same 
primary endpoint (ORR) which has been in place since the inception of the trial. Additionally, 
Amendment [ADDRESS_1089398] to eligibility criteria , allows for retro -
active collection of TMB samples  for Cohort B patients enrolled prior to Amendment 5 , as well as 
modifies the Arm 6 PE schedule to better align with physician visits.   
Amendment 5 Justification : 
Amendment 5 expands the patient population to include patient s receiving front line 
pembrolizumab ± pemetrexed , as well as relaxes the eligibility criteria for CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790370]. Per 
Investigator feedback, the minimum CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790371] 5 CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790372] 6 months to 4 months. Additionally, the term CPI [INVESTIGATOR_790373], which is more clinically relev ant.  
To enhance compliance with protocol procedures, the Week 10 tumor biopsy may be waived with 
written authorization from the Sponsor.  
To further characterize the patient population, Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) testing will be 
performed for exploratory analysis. TMB is a biomarker which has been associated with response 
to immunotherapy in multiple disease types. TMB measures the number of mutations within a 
tumor genome, and tumors which harbor more mutations have been shown to have a greater 
likelihood  of response to immunotherapy.  
Amendment 4 Justification : 
Amendment [ADDRESS_1089399] evaluation criteria was added. Visit windows were 
expanded to allow for weekends and holidays, and the text throughout has been streamlined and 
rearranged for compliance with  the ICH E6 guidelines  and NIH -FDA protocol temp late. 
Amendment 3 Justification : 
Heat Biologics, Inc.    Viagenpumatucel -L 
Protocol HS110 -102  CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 6, 24 May 2019  Page 89 of 95  Amendment 3 addresses the exclusion criteria and safety monitoring secondary to the recent 
publication of myocarditis with combination immunotherapy treatment.25 It also realigns the 
physical exam schedule for consistency with nivolumab dosing days.  
Amendment 2 Justification : 
Amendment 2 changes address the issue of  biopsies  that are not evaluable  in the on going cohorts. 
Recent e xperience suggests 25-40% of biopsies will not be evaluable. Patients without an 
evaluable pre-treatment biopsy are currently being balanced between the two arms  in a “next man 
up” fashion without knowing their TIL status. Arm 4 will  allow these patients to continue to 
receive  while  maintain ing the appropriate sample size of Arms 2 and 3. This Arm also acts as an 
overflow for patients who  consent to study participation and meet the eligibility criteria  for a cohort 
that is filled. Fin ally, Amendment 2 will allow prospective revision of the expansion cohort 
selection criteria based on emerging response data from the trial.  
Amendment 1 Justification:  
In the period since the HS110 -102 protocol was initiated, the treatment paradigm for thi s 
population has undergone a substantial change with the approval of checkpoint inhibitors for 
treatment of NSCLC.  The main change in Amendment 1 is in response to that changing landscape: 
addition of study arms to assess the combination of viagenpumatucel with nivolumab 
(administered per current, approved labeling).  Because nivolumab is an approved therapy for this 
indication and theophylline is not, the option for combination with theophylline is being 
discontinued (no patients were enrolle d in the theophylline arm of the study.)  Amendment 1 also 
introduces mandatory biopsies for the study arms prescribing the 2-drug combination of 
viagenpumatucel with nivolumab; this requirement is implemented to define the characteristics of 
the enrolled p opulation and to allow comparison to emerging literature on patients who typi[INVESTIGATOR_790374] (see  Section 2.3  for more information).  Finally, Amendment 1 
allows for expansion (of up to 30 patients) for any combination treatments that  show efficacy 
signals.

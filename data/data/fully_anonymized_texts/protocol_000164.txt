DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
ProTmune is a donor -sourced, patient -specific, allogeneic cell therapy product consisting of the 
cells contained within a human mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) colle ction that have been 
programmed through an ex vivo  programming process using a combination of 2 small molecules, 
16,16 -dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (FT1050) and dexamethasone (FT4145). The cell populations 
include hematopoietic cells and other cell types. The  final ProTmune product is formulated in 
Plasmalyte -A (or equivalent) and human serum albumin (HSA) . 
Mobilized peripheral blood cells will be obtained from a matched -unrelated donor for a given 
subject. An 8/[ADDRESS_829350] that consenting donors be mobilized with filgrastim to achieve a 
target collected CD34+ dose of ≥7 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg in Phase  1 and ≥5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
in Phase 2. However, if the donor mPB unit collected for a subject in Phase 1 is not 
≥5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593], and in Phase 2 is not ≥3 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_293641], the mPB unit will not be processed for ProTmune manufacturing and the subject will be 
considered a screen failure.

The Cell Processing Facility (CPF) at each participating site will be qu alified and trained by [CONTACT_622836] a single 
ProTmune qualification run. Additionally, Fate technical representative(s) will be on site for the 
manufacture of each CPF’s firs t or second  subject treatments and subsequent subjec t treatments 
as necessary by [CONTACT_622837].  
ProTmune or Control cells will be released immediately by [CONTACT_622838], 
including filtration, final packaging, rapid release testing, and labeling.  
SAFETY ENDPOINTS:  
The safety endpoints for both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts of the study include the assessment of 
adverse events as defined in the NCI CTCAE version 4.0, vital signs, physical examination 
findings, engraftment, graft failure, chimerism, clinical laboratory assessments, and 
electrocardiographic data through a 12 -lead ECG.  
EFFICACY ENDPOINTS:  
The primary efficacy endpoint for both the Phase 1 and Phase 2  parts of the study is the following:  
• Cumulative incidence of CIBMTR Gr ades II -IV aGvHD through Visit Day +100 based on 
investigator  results . Death and relapse without CIBMTR Grades II -IV aGvHD will be 
considered competing risks.  
o Each study site will determine the presence or absence of aGvHD by [CONTACT_622839], liver, and gut along with assigning an overall grade 
according to the CIBMTR aGvHD Grading Scale ( Appendix E ).

follow -up will be conducted upon completion of the Day +[ADDRESS_829357] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values as descriptive 
statistics. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_622840]. Time -to-event variables will be 
summarized using Kaplan -Meier method s; competing risk methods will be used in t he presence 
of competing risk factors (e.g., death or relapse without aGvHD for evaluating aGvHD) .  
Efficacy analyses will be performed based on the mITT Population. Additional sensitivity 
analyses will be performed based on the PP Population for the prima ry and key secondary efficacy 
endpoint for Phase 2 . Efficacy data from the Phase 1 part of the study and Phase 2 part of the study 
will be summarized separately. Summary tables will present results for each phase by [CONTACT_6490]. The safety profile will  be based on adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations,

Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  16 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
The background cumula tive incidence rate of International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry 
(IBMTR) Grades B -D aGvHD in this population is assumed to be between 40% and 60% as 
reported in the literature ( Jagasia et al. 2012 ).   
Phase 1:  Allowing for a dropout rate of approximately 15%, approximately 8- 12 subjects will be 
enrolled to include 6 -10 evaluable.   
Phase 2:  When accounting for competing risk factors (death or relapse without aGvHD), a sample 
size of 80 subjects ( 40 subjects in each treatment group) allows for approximate ly 85% power to 
detect a reduction in the cumulative incidence rate of CIBMTR Grades II -IV aGvHD through Day 
+100 from 55% to 25% (i.e., a hazard ratio of 0.3464) in the Control versus ProTmune treatment 
arms using a two -sided log -rank test at a 0.0 5 signi ficance level. This calculation assumes the 
cumulative incidence rate for competing risk factors is 10% through Visit Day +100. Allowing 
for a dropout rate of approximately 15%, approximately 90 subjects will be randomized to include 
approximately 80 treated  subjects  in the mITT Population. The sample size was calculated using 
PASS Sample Size Software ( PASS 16 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software, 2018). 
SITES:  Approximately 5 to 10 sites in the [LOCATION_002] for the Phase 1 part of the study, and 
approximately 14 to 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002] for the Phase 2 part of the study.

Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  26 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Background 
Hematologic malignancies encompass a wide range of cancers that  involve the bone marrow (BM) 
and lymph nodes. Rich in growth factors and cytokines, the BM provides an ideal 
microenvironment for hematologic malignancies that lends itself to progression of leukemogenesis and cancer progression ( Raimondo et al. 2015). Ma lignancies of the BM, such as acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), affect all ages ( Smith et al. 2011).  
Recent advances in survival and treatment options using chemotherapy, transplantation, and radiation have resulted in survival rates around 90% for some hematologic malignancies (McLaughlin 2015). However, patients still incur numerous adverse reactions and systemic 
toxicities due to such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For patients who do not obtain remission or who relapse, allogeneic hemato poietic cell transplantation (HCT) may be the only remaining treatment option 
(McLaughlin 2015).  
Before receiving allogeneic HCT, a patient must undergo 1 of 2 types of preparative treatment regimens: myeloablative conditioning (MAC) or non- MAC, such as reduced intensity 
conditioning. The goal of such conditioning regimens is to suppress the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s immune system sufficiently to allow adequate engraftment of the donor cells, to reduce the presence of neoplastic cells.  
1.[ADDRESS_829371] is often the only therapeutic option that offers the potential to prolong lifespan or even a curative outcome. While BM has historically been the pr incipal source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in allogeneic 
HCT, the majority of recent procedures have been conducted with mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) as a cell source, including mPB collected from matched related donors or matched unrelated donor s (National Marrow Donor Program [NMDP]  2015). In the [LOCATION_002], approximately 
20,[ADDRESS_829372] each year ( Majhail et al. 2015 ). Only 
one-third of all patients eligible for allogeneic HCT have a human leukocyte antig en 
(HLA) -matched related donor in their family and in those cases, transplant from a matched related 
donor becomes the optimal treatment.  
Patients who do not have an HLA -matched relative rely on alternative stem cell sources, which 
include: matched unrelated donors, haploidentical donors, and umbilical cord blood ( Ballen et al. 
2012). Approximately 50% to 60% of allogeneic HCTs reported to the Center for International 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) use unrelated donors (Majhail et al. 2015).  
Additionally, over the past decade, the number of peripheral blood cell grafts facilitated by [CONTACT_622841], such that currently around 75% of unrelated grafts are peripheral blood cells ( Woolfrey et al.  2011).  
This shift toward the use of mPB over BM was enabled by [CONTACT_622842], obviating the need to harvest T -cells from a donor through surgical aspi[INVESTIGATOR_622797]. In addition, mPB 
results in quicker engraftment kinetics and potentially decreased early morbidity re lative to BM 
(Schmitz et al. 2006; Nagler et al. 2012; Eapen et al. 2007). Specifically, several large, multicenter, 
randomized studies have collectively demonstrated that time to engraftment/reconstitution is faster

Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_829373] with mPB than with BM, which may be associated with decreased rates of relapse 
and infections ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_622798]. 2009).  
Numerous complications may arise from HCT, whether using BM, mPB, or umbilical cord blood. 
The primary complication that may arise from HCT is graft- versus -host di sease (GvHD). The use 
of mPB is associated with higher rates of GvHD compared to BM, which has limited the universal adoption of this otherwise convenient and highly effective cell source for HCT. 
Infections are a second important contributor of morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing 
HCT. Transplant -related infections are a universal issue that span across the HCT spectrum of 
stem cell sources, donor graft types and conditioning regimens ( Wingard et al. 2010).  
For patients undergoing HCT, there is  a clear need for new approaches to reduce rates of GvHD 
without compromising the anti- leukemia and anti -infective properties of the T -cells in the graft.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_829374] 
that differ from those of the donor cells. This initial antigen recognition results in T -cell ac tivation 
and proliferation, which leads to the production and secretion of a variety of cytokines, which are 
responsible for the inflammatory effects and tissue damage associated with GvHD (Ferrar a and 
Deeg 1991).  
C
onventionally, GvHD was divided into acute and chronic variants based upon the time of onset, 
usi
ng an arbitrary cutoff of 100 days for acute GvHD (aGvHD). Risk factors for the development 
of GvHD include degree of HLA disparity (HLA mismatch), donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622799], 
increasing age of the host, CMV status of donor and host, intensity of the transplant conditioning 
regimen, GvHD prophylactic regimen used, source of cell graft, greater pre -transplant 
comorbidities, and specific HLA haplotypes ( Sorror et al. 2014; Hahn et al. 2008).  
Betw
een 35% and 60% of patients who undergo al loge nic HCT are likely to develop aGvHD 
(Jacobson and Vogelsang 2007, Choi a nd Reddy 2014). In 1974, Glucksberg published the first 
aGV
HD
 classification (Glucksberg et al. 1974), modified by [CONTACT_622843] 1975. The Glucksberg 
sys
tem remains the most commonly us ed system. Although this classification has prognostic value, 
it is complex. In fact, there are 125 possible combinations of organ involvement and severity, 
whe
re
 each of 3 organs is staged from 0 to 4, which are then combined to calculate an overall 
grade . However, in the overall grading system, 62 of the possible 125 combinations  are not defined 
(Cahn et al. 2005). In recognition of the systems limitations, a consensus workshop was held in 
1995 
and a modified Glucks berg  grading system was proposed ( Przepi [INVESTIGATOR_622800]. 1995) and a 
severity index published a year later (Rowlings et al. 1997). This modified grading scale is referred 
to as the CIBMTR grading scale. A revised CIBMTR scale was published in 2012 ( CIB MT R 
Forms Manual 2012) and will be the scale by w hich aGvHD will be graded in this study. 
Acute GvHD is classified based on the degree of severity of the affected organs, skin, liver, and 
gastrointestinal tract, with involvement of each organ ranging 
from mild to severe based on the 
International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Index (Majhail et al. 2015; Rowlings et al.

understood. The development of predictive biomarkers to better assess the balance between GvHD 
and graft -versus- leukemia (GvL), as well as response to therapy, may provide better insights into 
disease progno sis and treatment optimization. A number of biomarkers have been previously 
proposed and summarized ( Rozmus and Shultz 2011). Human leukocyte antigen disparity between 
donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622802] (cGvHD), however while HLA -A/-B disparity increases risk of cGvHD, HLA -DR or -DQ does not. The role of minor 
histocompatibility antigens in promoting GvHD has been debated as has the role of non- HLA 
polymorphisms. Non- HLA polymorphisms associated with susceptibility  or severity of GvHD 
include heparinase, poly -ADP -ribose polymerase 1, madCAM -1, haptoglobin, HMGB -1 CCR9, 
and a range of classical Th1 and Th2 cytokines, including interleukin (IL) -10, tumor necrosis 
factor -α, IL-6, IL -1α, and interferon (IFN) -ɣ. Increased numbers of CD8/CD4 T -cells, TH -17 
T-cells, and monocytes can be observed in tissues affected by [CONTACT_622844]. Where practical, 
investigating the expression and distribution of putative biomarkers may provide additi onal 
insights into the safety and efficacy of novel approaches to treat or prevent GvHD. 
1.2.2 Current Strategies to Prevent and/or Treat Graft- versus -Host Disease  
In the mid -1980s, calcineurin-inhibitor- based regimens were first used for GvHD prevention and 
treatment ( Choi and Reddy 2014). While there have been several new insights regarding the 
pathophysiology of GvHD, there has been little progress in GvHD prevention and treatment. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_622803] -matching between donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622804], 
aGvHD. Graft -versus- host disease still develops in approximately 40% to 60% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(Choi and Reddy 2014). Additional preventative and therapeutic measures used for GvHD include non-specific immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids and methotrexate, as well as more 
specific T -cell immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine  and tacrolimus  (FK506). 
Corticosteroids remain the most widely used "front -line" therapy for the treatment of clinical 
GvHD, commonly administered in combination with therapeutic doses of cyclosporine  or 
tacrolimus . Long -term use of corticosteroids may result in numerous adverse reactions, including 
Cushingoid features, hyperglycemia, psychosis, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], myopathy, osteoporosis, cataract formation, osteonecrosis, and immunosuppression ( Liu et al. 2013) . In addition, corticosteroids 
have been linked with a variety of drug- drug interactions, including those that share critical 
metabolic steps mediated by [CONTACT_9058] P450 enzymes, resulting in clearance of concomitantly administered corticosteroids ( Feldweg  and Leddy 1999). Given the number and severity of the 
side effects associated with existing treatment options, there is a clear need for new approaches to treat GvHD.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_829376] patients and modifications to the 
guidelines for infection prevention, infections remain the primary cause of death for 17% to 20% of patients who undergo allogeneic HCT ( Tomblyn et al. 2009). As such, there remains an unmet 
medical need for the prevention and pre- emptive therapy of infections in the HCT setting.  
Cytomegalovirus is an important pathogen in patients who undergo an allogeneic HCT, since CMV can affect almost any organ, and can result in pneumonia, gastrointestinal ulcers, and

Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_829377] affects approximately 80% of 
CMV -seropositive patients ( Ljungman et al. 2011 ). Although current strategies have resulted in 
the decreased incidence of CMV disease, CMV prophylaxis and pre -emptive therapy are not 
without risk. Ganciclovir, a synthetic guanine derivative active against CMV, is one of several drugs utilized for both prophylaxis and pre -emptive therapy in patients receiving allogeneic HCT 
(Tomblyn et al. 2009). Th ose patients who do not tolerate standard doses of ganciclovir typi[INVESTIGATOR_622805], with lower doses in those with renal impairment ( Tomblyn et al. 2009).  
The use of ganciclovir has an important toxicity profile as noted by [CONTACT_622845] w arning 
for granulocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia diaphoresis ( Ganciclovir [Systemic]: Drug 
Information 2015). In animal studies, ganciclovir was found to be carcinogenic, teratogenic, and caused aspermatogenesis ( Ganciclovir [Systemic]: Drug Infor mation 2015). Significant adverse 
reactions (>10%) of fever, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, cytopenias, retinal detachment, increased serum creatinine, sepsis, and diaphoresis are associated with ganciclovir ( Ganciclovir [Systemic]: 
Drug Information 2015). When given at engraftment, ganciclovir can be deleterious to the graft 
due to prolonged neutropenia, and can result in more invasive bacterial and fungal infections (Boeckh et al. 1996; Goodrich et al. 1993; Salzberger et al. 1997).  
As use of pre -emptive anti-CMV therapy has increased, late CMV infection and disease (after 
Day +100) has become more significant following allogeneic HCT and is associated with 
non-relapse mortality (NRM) ( Ozdemir et al. 2007). To minimize the toxicity from antiviral 
agents, m ost prefer a pre -emptive approach for CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622806]. 
The drawback of pre- emptive therapy, in addition to drug toxicity, is that the outcome is limited 
by [CONTACT_622846] (Tomblyn et al. 2009). The outcome of pre -emptive 
therapy is largely dependent on timely detection of CMV in the blood before the onset of disease and the early detection of CMV. Disease may occur due to missed surveillance tests or tests that are spaced too far apart. If a patient progresses to disease, treatment is not always effective; CMV pneumonia is the most detrimental complication of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622807], despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391] ( Reed et al. 1988 ). 
The opportunistic bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens that occur in allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622808], including, but not limited to CNS and ocular manifestations, sinusitis and mucositis, pneumonia, esophagitis, diarrhea and colitis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis , nephritis, skin lesions, bone marrow suppression, blood stream infection, 
shock (including septic shock) and fever (Tomblyn et al. 2009). Among the current strategies for prophylaxis or pre -emptive therapy are fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin) and im mune globulin 
intravenous (IV) for bacterial infections; acyclovir for HSV infections; fluconazole for fungal diseases; and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole for parasitic infections ( Tomblyn et al. 2009 ). The 
adverse reactions and toxicities from such drugs include, but are not limited to, anaphylaxis, QT prolongation; hepatoxicity and hematologic toxicity; central nervous system and dermatologic 
adverse reactions; pulmonary edema (e.g., transfusion- related acute lung injury); tendinitis and 
tendon rupture; ex acerbation of muscle weakness; fatal reactions to agranulocytosis, aplastic 
anemia, and other blood dyscrasias; fatal renal failure; and fatal reactions to Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] ( Acyclovir [Systemic]: Drug Information 2015;

programmed through an ex vivo  programming process using a combination of 2 small molecules, 
16,16- dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (FT1050) and dexamethasone (FT4145). The cell populations 
include hematopoietic cells and other cell types.  
The objective of ProTmune is to prevent aGvHD and CMV infection. ProTmune products are 
manufactured by [CONTACT_622847] a combination of 
16, 16- dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2, also referred to as FT1050) and a glucocorticoid 
(dexamethasone, also referred to as FT4145). ProTmune is intended for adults who will undergo HCT with cells  contained in donor mPB units. Based on nonclinical data, ProTmune has the 
potential to reduce aGvHD while retaining GvL activity through programming a number of key biological pathways in both HSC and T -cells contained in mPB. Three processes are thought to be 
responsible for the development of aGvHD: cytokine storm following tissue injury caused by [CONTACT_622848], alloactivation of donor T -cells (activation, proliferation, 
and differentiation), and organ damage caused by [CONTACT_150781] t cytotoxic activity or through the 
production of inflammatory cytokines ( Hill and Ferrara 2000; Bouchlaka et al. 2010).

to reduced rates of aGvHD without compromising the GvL response. Nonclinical studies are

FT1050 specifically interacts with HSC by [CONTACT_129203] G protein- coupled prostaglandin receptors, 
EP2 and EP4, which activates adenylate cyclase and increases the intracellular levels of the 
secondary messenger molecule, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in 
intracellular cAMP initiates a signaling cascade that activates cAMP response element -binding 
protein and other transcription factors in the nucleus inducing a number of gene expression

HSC function ( North et al. 2007 and Hoggatt et al. 2009). Glucocorticoids were identified in a 
combinatorial small molecule screen performed at Fate. Dexamethasone (FT4145) was found to 
synergize with FT1050 to further enhance the homing and engraftment properties of HSC.  
1.3.3 Role of FT1050 and FT4145 in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Biology  
Approximately 30% of patients receive a suboptimal dose of HSC due to poor mobilization and 
collection, which can result in delayed neutrophil recovery and increased susceptibility to life-threatening infections ( To et al. 2011). Approaches t o improve HSC engraftment have 
previously focused on increasing numbers of donor HSCs using multi -week expansion strategies 
(Wagner et al. 2015); however, more recent approaches involve simple ex vivo  programming 
strategies designed to enhance the homing efficiencies of HSCs to the BM niche ( Hogatt et al. 
2009; Greim et al. 2014 ).  
Several factors play a role in the engraftment of HSC into BM. Bone marrow niche sites represent specific microenvironments that promote the proliferation and differentiation of HSC into mature blood cells. An important phase of engraftment of HSC involves the homing of these cells to the appropriate sites within the BM. A key component of this homing mechanism is the interaction between stromal derived factor -1 (SDF -1), which is displayed on cells within the BM niche, and 
C-X- C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), which is expressed on the cell surface of HSC. The 
ligand -receptor interaction between SDF -1 and CXCR4 promotes the localization and retention of 
HSC in the BM niche. Ex vivo  programming of mPB derived HSCs with FT1050 and FT4145 
leads to significant upregulation of CXCR4 and enhanced migration in vitro  to gradients of SDF -1 
in transwell assays; see ProTmune Investigator’s Brochure (IB). The mechanism of action for the 
2 modulators, FT1050 and FT4145 is derived by a “cross -talk” that occurs via downstream 
intracellular signaling events which directly leads to the synergistic increase in CXCR4 gene and protein expression. 
1.4 Risk/Benefit  
1.4.1 Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS] In vitro  characterization studies of hematopoietic stem cells  
Homing is an important first step in the engraftment process in which circulating HSC actively 
cross the blood/BM endothelium barrier and lodge in BM niches. These niche sites represent specific microenvi ronments that promote the expansion and differentiation of HSC into 
progenitors and mature lineages. The receptor CXCR4 is one of the key surface receptors involved in stem cell homing, activation of this receptor by [CONTACT_622849] o f these 
stem cells towards the high levels of SDF -1α. Additionally, SDF-1α is the natural ligand for 
CXCR4 found in high levels in post -cytoablated BM ( Hogatt et al. 2009). FT1050 and 
FT4145- programmed HSC exhibited dramatic upregulation of CXCR4 at both t he messenger 
ribonucleic acid level (~60 -fold, p≤ 0.0001; paired t -test; see ProTmune IB ) and the surface protein 
level (p≤0.0005; paired t -test; see ProTmune IB ). Hematopoietic stem cells programmed with 
FT1050 and FT4145 also displayed increased migration rates to a gradient of SDF -1 in an in vitro  
transwell migration assay relative to vehicle controls (p=0.0001; paired t -test). This increased 
directional migration demonstrates an increased SDF-1α homing ability in the programmed cells.

Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  32 [IP_ADDRESS] In vivo  repopulating ability (engraftment) 
Increased CXCR4 levels on HSC may lead to an increased ability of these cells to migrate in vivo  
into BM stem cell niches and accelerate engraftment, thereby [CONTACT_622850]. 
Using an immunodeficient mouse model, Fate evaluated the ability of ex vivo  programmi ng of 
mPB CD34+ cells with FT1050 and FT4145 to improve engraftment. Compared to untreated 
control cells, significantly enhanced engraftment (engraftment defined >0.5% human CD45 in the 
marrow, p=0.01; unpaired t -test) of human CD34+ treated with FT1050 and FT4145 was observed 
in several independent experiments with 3 different donors, with an average overall human 
hematopoietic cell engraftment of 8% at [ADDRESS_829380] infusion compared to 2.9% in the control group; see ProTmune IB . 
Human chimerism was tracked in the peripheral blood of human mPB CD34+ treated with vehicle, FT1050, or FT1050 and FT4145 for all 3 donors over time. This study demonstrated that ex vivo  
programming significantly improved long -term engraftment outcomes of human mPB CD34+ 
cells.  
Using ex vivo  programming to enhance immune reconstitution minimizes the risks of infections 
and relapse. In multiple in vitro  assays and in vivo  models, HSC modulated with FT1050 and 
FT4145 demonstrated improved homing, migration and enhanced long- term engraftment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] T-cell characterization studies  
As highlighted earlier, one of the major complications associated with allogenic HCT is aGvHD mediated by [CONTACT_622851] T -cells. Fate has conducted several nonclinical studies to 
characterize how the T -cell compartment of mPB is affected by [CONTACT_622852]1050 
and FT4145. T -cells programmed with FT1050 and FT4145 were characterized using both in vitro 
assays (e.g., mixed lymphocyte reactions) and in vivo  models (e.g., GvHD and GvL). Programmed 
T-cells (both CD4 and CD8) had lower proliferation rates relative to vehicle -treated cells in a 5 -day 
co-culture with mismatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a different donor. In the 
mouse GvHD model, T -cells programmed with FT1050 and FT4145 had reduced levels of 
inflammatory cytokines, reduced GvHD scores and enhanced survival relative to the vehicle treated cells; see ProTmune IB . Lastly, in mouse GvL models, T -cells programmed with FT1050 
and FT4145 retained GvL activity against the A20 lymphoma cells; see ProTmune IB.  
ProTmune utilizes a small molecular modulator, referred to as FT4145, which synergizes with FT1050 to promote the supra -physiologic activation of genes implicated in the cell cycle, immune 
tolerance, and anti -viral properties of T -cells. Nonclinical in vitro  and animal studies have 
demonstrated that mPB treated with FT1050 and FT4145 result in reduced allogeneic GvHD while maintaining GvL response, suggesting that ProTmune may provide a clinical benefit in terms of GvHD reductio n. These data also suggest that programmed cell populations in mPB treated with 
FT1050 and FT4145 have further potential to prevent viral (CMV) reactivation though the same modulation of T- cells.  
Combined, these studies demonstrated that pharmacologic prog ramming mPB cells with FT1050 
+ FT4145 prior to allogenic HCT may offer an innovative therapeutic approach to reduce rates of GvHD without compromising the GvL response.

Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  33 [IP_ADDRESS] Summary of nonclinical findings 
Predictive in vitro  assays and in vivo  models have dem onstrated the potential safety and efficacy 
of ProTmune. Results of the currently available in vitro  and in vivo  nonclinical studies have 
demonstrated that ex vivo  programming of mPB cells with FT1050 and FT4145 can enhance 
engraftment of HSC and reduce Gv HD through programming a number of key biological pathways 
in mPB T -cells. Reduced expression levels of phenotypic markers of activation is suggestive of a 
reduced activation capacity in the programmed T -cells that could, in concert with the cytokine 
data,  lead to a lower potential for transplanted cells to promote GvHD in patients. Furthermore, 
mouse models demonstrated that treatment with FT1050 and FT4145 led to reduced GvHD scores, 
enhanced survival, reduced levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines without compromising the GvL 
activity of the T -cells. Taken together, these nonclinical studies demonstrate the safety and 
potential efficacy of ProTmune.

1.5 Rationale  
1.5.1 Proof-of- Concept Clinical Data  
Recent results from Fate’s Phase 2 PUMA clinical trial of ProHema (FT1050 -programm ed 
umbilical cord blood) provide compelling proof -of-concept data that ex vivo  programming of 
donor grafts can enhance the therapeutic properties of donor -derived T -cells in the setting of HCT. 
Interim data from the PUMA study showed that subjects administ ered ProHema experienced a 
46% reduction in severe viral infection- related adverse events following HCT. Specifically, 9 of 
28 subjects administered ProHema, or 32%, experienced 1 or more severe viral infection- related 
adverse events (Grades 3 through 5) following HCT, as compared to 9 of 15 control subjects, or 
60%. Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_622809] -HCT (30, 60, 100, and 180 days) showed that, in subjects administered 
ProHema, T -cells had improved persistence compared to T -cells of control subjects. These 
observations are consistent with a 2014 publication by [CONTACT_622831]’s collaborators that investigated the T-cell compartment of subjects administered ProHema in Fate’s Phase 1b clinical tria l of ProHema 
(Li et al. 2014). The collaborator’s immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_622810] T -cell 
compartment of subjects administered ProHema exhibited a higher percentage of T -cells with a 
stem/memory phenotype compared to samples from historical contr ol subjects (N = 53). The data 
from the PUMA study, including both the reduction in severe viral infection -related adverse events 
and the phenotypic changes to the T -cell compartment, provides supporting evidence for the ability 
to efficiently program donor immune cells.  
Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing HCT procedures. During the first [ADDRESS_829382] of T -cells comes from de novo 
Fate Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol PT -001 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_829383]- transplant period, where it has been reported that over 90% of CMV infections occur within 
the first [ADDRESS_829384] ( Jain et al. 2014).  
The protection afforded by [CONTACT_389721] -derived T -cells is limited during the initial period following 
HCT for several reasons. One of t he factors that limits the effectiveness of the donor -derived 
T-cells in fighting viral infections results directly from the HCT conditioning regimen. In the days 
following HCT, high levels of inflammatory cytokines are present in patients’ blood, which ca n 
drive the rapid expansion and exhaustion of the adoptively -transferred CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells. 
This response results in a depleted and functionally -impaired T -cell compartment, limiting the 
ability of these cells to provide immune protection. 
1.5.2 Nonclinical Data Supporting ProTmune’s Ability to Reduce Viral Infections 
Fate has been advancing the nonclinical development of ProTmune, an mPB unit programmed 
with 2 small molecules, FT1050, which is the small molecule Fate uses for the production of ProHema, and F T4145. This development effort has been driven by [CONTACT_622831]’s specific intent of 
enhancing the therapeutic properties of donor T -cells in in the setting of HCT. Nonclinical studies 
demonstrate that ex vivo  programming mPB with the combination of FT1050 and FT4145 renders 
the immune cells in mPB less responsive to the high levels of activating cytokines, which reduces the expansion and exhaustion of donor T -cells. In vitro  assays designed to mimic the high levels 
of inflammatory cytokines found in patients follow ing HCT show that programmed T -cells have 
reduced proliferation rates and reduced expression levels of key T -cell activation markers 
compared to vehicle treated cells; see ProTmune IB . Importantly, these assays show that the 
viability of the programmed T -cells is not negatively impacted; see ProTmune IB . Preliminary 
data suggests that preventing the rapid expansion and exhaustion of T -cells during the first week 
post- HCT has the potential to preserve a diverse T -cell repertoire over the first critical weeks  and 
months following HCT, and that the programming of donor -derived T -cells has the potential to 
reduce the incidence of life- threatening viral infections.  
1.[ADDRESS_829385] becomes 
the only remaining therapeutic option that offers the potential to prolong lifespan or even a curative outcome. Approximately 50% to 60% of allogeneic HCTs reported to the CIBMTR use unrelated donors (Majhail et al. 2015 ). Over the past decade, the number of peripheral blood cell grafts 
facilitated by [CONTACT_622853], such that currently around 75% of HCT procedures that utilize unrelated grafts employ peripheral blood cells ( Woolfr ey et al.  2011).  
Several large, multicenter, randomized studies have collectively demonstrated that time to engraftment/reconstitution is faster and more robust with mPB than with BM ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_622798]. 2009 ). 
However, mPB is also associated with higher rates of both acute and cGvHD (as compared to the use of BM or umbilical cord blood), which has limited the universal adoption of this otherwise convenient and highly effective cell source for HCT. This is attributed in part to the large number of T-cells infused  with mPB as compared to other cell sources ( Anasetti et al. 2012). Since no 
therapy has yet been approved for the prevention of GvHD, current treatments for GvHD include drugs prescribed off -label and can thus be ineffective. For patients undergoing HCT, there is a 
Fate Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol PT -001 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  35 clear need for new approaches to reduce rates of GvHD without compromising the anti -leukemia 
and anti-infective properties of the T- cells in the graft.  
ProTmune has the potential to reduce aGvHD while retaining GvL activity through programming 
a number of key biological pathways in both HSC and T -cells in mPB. Additionally, previous 
clinical experience with one of the ProTmune programming agents (FT1050) suggests the potential of ProTmune to reduce viral infections following HCT. The nonclinical studies summarized 
previously demonstrate the safety and potential efficacy of ProTmune. 
Taken together, patients undergoing HCT who receive mPB that has been programmed using 
FT1050 and FT4145 are expected to have improved outcomes. The primary goal of this Phase 1/[ADDRESS_829386]

This is a Phase 1, non- randomized, open- label/Phase 2, randomized, blinded, multi -center study 
of ProTmune ex vivo  programmed mPB ver sus non- programmed mPB cells for allogeneic HCT in 
adult subjects with hematologic malignancies in the [LOCATION_002]. All subjects in Phases 1 and 2 
will receive a conditioning regimen  comprising 1 of the following 5 preparative regimens: 
fludarabine and busulfan (FluBu4); busulfan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy); Cy and ≥12 Gy 
total body irraditiation (TBI); TBI and etoposide; or fludarabine and melpha lan (FluMel 140) . 
Refer to Section 3.4 for a detailed description of the regimens required per the protocol. 
It is anticipated that the majority of subjects will be recruited from referrals for transplantation at the study sites. Potential study subjects can be pre -screened for study eligibility (evaluation of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria) based on the standard of care assessments that were completed prior to obtaining an informed consent, only with previously obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approval of such pre -screening procedures . Data 
will be requested from study centers in order to track screening and recruitment activity.  
Both the Phase 1 part of the study and Phase 2 part of the study will include a Screening Period (Day -53 through Day -11), Subject Conditioning Period (Day -10 through Day -1), Study 
Treatment Administration Day (Day 0; Day of HCT), Post- Transplant Follow -up Period (Day  +1 
through Day +730, consisting of Post -Transplant Assessment Days and Post -Transplant Weekly 
Assessments, then intermittent assessments), and  an Early Withdrawal Visit (if applicable). Refer

of increased platelet consumption; 
o A threshold of >50 ×109/L if an invasive procedure is planned; 
o Single donor platelets should be used in preference to random donor platelets, if feasible; 
and 
o HLA -matched platelets should be used in subjects with allo- immunization;  
• Red blood cell transfusion guidelines:  
o An attempt should be made to maintain the hematocrit ≥24% and hemoglobin >8 g/dL, or 
higher in cases of symptomatic management of anemia or other medically indicated 
indications; and 
• Filgrastim (granulocyte -colony stimulating factor) can be administered at 5 µg/kg/day 
beginning on Day +12, if engraftment has not occurred, until the ANC is >500 cells/ µL. At 
Investigator discretion, filgrastim can be administered longer to support the white blood cells. Similarly, per Investigator discretion, filgrastim may be started before Day +12 if subsequent

requirements during screening and whose donor cells are not pr ocessed as ProTmune or Control. 
This may occur for many reasons, such as:  
• The donor unit does not meet requirements for ProTmune (or Control) processing, such as  
CD34+ count of the mPB unit is lower than specified in the protocol or cannot be processed 
prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_622815],

5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
According to the American Society of Blood & Marrow Transplant, the absolute cell threshold to 
guarantee engraftment is not specifically known. The minimally accepted cells dose is 2 × 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg. The literature reports successful engraftment can occur at doses as low as 
0.75 × 106 CD34+ cel ls/kg. However, higher doses are associated with faster engraftment, reduced 
rates of infection, and NRM. Therefore, the Sponsor has selected a target minimum treatment dose 
of ≥2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  
5.[ADDRESS_829438] an available 8/8  HLA -A, -B, 
-C, and -DRB1 -matched unrelated peripheral blood cell donor will be randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to result in approximately 80 treated subjects  (40 subjects per treatment  group) to receive 
either unmanipulated mPB cells (control arm) or ProTmune ex vivo  programmed mPB cells 
(experimental arm) and stratified by [CONTACT_748]' CMV status. Randomization will be performed during the Subject Conditioning Period once the central lab CMV results are known and must occur no later than Day -7.  
Treatment assignment in Phase [ADDRESS_829439]  and Sponsor, but not Cell 
Processing Facility (CPF) staff. To blind the Investigator and subject, ProTmune and control mPB 
units will be prepared by [CONTACT_622859]. Infusion of the control unit will be held until the afternoon of the subject’s Day 0 to mimic the processing time of ProTmune. The ProTmune unit and Control unit will look similar . Both ProTmune and Control will be placed  
in 400 mL blood transfer bags. The volume of each unit may be reduced or increased to achieve a final volume of 250 mL; volume increases will be achieved by [CONTACT_622860] -A (or 
equivalent) with 4.2% - 5% HSA according to the Batch Production record and site protocol.  The

will be sent to the study Sponsor and CRO.  
Note: The Investigator must print and file the unblinding notification within the subject’s source documentation along with a written rationale for the necessity to unblind the subject. A new sealed envelope with a 6- digit unblinding authorization code will be sent to the site for use with future 
subjects.

include hematopoietic cells and other cell types. The final ProTmune product is formulated in Plasmalyte- A (or equivalent) and HSA. Refer to the ProTmune IB  for specific detai ls regarding 
the manufacture and release testing of the investigational product. 
Control cells will be comprised of an unmanipulated mPB unit that is visually indistinguishable 
from ProTmune.  Both ProTmune and Control will be placed in  400 mL blood transf er bags. The 
volume of each unit may be reduced or increased to achieve a final volume of 250 mL; volume 
increases will be achieved by [CONTACT_622860] -A (or equivalent) with 4.2% - 5% HSA

Visit, if applicable.  
7.6 Relapse of Malignancy 
The definition of  relapse is based on the disease under study and should be sourced from the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. For AML and ALL, relapse following CR is defined as reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or the finding of >5% blasts 
in the BM, not attributable to another cause or extramedullary relapse. 
Evidence of minimal residual disease will not be sufficient to meet the definition of disease 
recurrence in the context of this study.

The safety endpoints for both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts of the study include the assessment of 
adverse events, vital signs, physical examination findings, engraftment, graft failure, chimerism, 
clinical laboratory assessments, and electrocardiographic data through a 12 -lead ECG.  
8.1 Adverse Events  
Any adverse event experienced between signing the ICF an d prior to administration of the study 
conditioning regimen will be recorded in the medical history. 
Adverse events will be collected during Phase 1 and 2, as follows: 
• All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from Day -10 through Day +365, and only 
SAEs related to the infused cells ( ProTmune ex vivo  programmed mPB cells or Control mPB 
cells) from Day +366 through Day +730; 
• Start of conditioning regimen (Day -10) through Day +100: Adverse events associated with 
infusion reactions, GvHD, infe ctions, or engraftment failure (Grades 1 through 5). All other 
adverse events (Grades 2 through 5). Laboratory abnormalities will only be recorded as adverse 
events if deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737];  
• From Day +100 through Day + 365: Only adverse  events associated with GvHD, infections, or 
secondary engraftment failure (Grades 1 through 5);  
The details of each event will be recorded in the appropriate eCRF.   
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dis ease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
Adverse events, which include clinically significant laboratory test results, will be monitored and documented. Subjects should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Investigators should make an assessment for adverse events at each visit and record 
the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
The following information about each adverse event should be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF: 
• Onset and cessation dates of adverse events or SAEs,  
• Severity,  
• SAE (yes or no), 
• Relationship to the cell product , (ProTmune ex vivo  programmed mPB cells or Control mPB 
cells) . For SAEs only, relationship to conditioning regimen medications , and GvHD 
prophylaxis medications (tacrolimus  and methotrexate)  is also required. 
• Action taken in response to the event. 
Fate Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol PT -001 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  72 The Investigator will make assessments of adverse event or SAE severity and of the possible 
relationship to study medication (s). 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome r ather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at screening or randomization should not be reported as an 
adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings that are detected during the study or are present at screening or randomization and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as adverse events. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding meets the definition of an adverse event, a 
diagnosis or any clinical signs and symptoms rather than the abnormal laboratory finding should be recorded if possible.  
All adverse events must be followed u ntil resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event 
is otherwise explained or is judged by [CONTACT_39982], or 
until the subject is lost to follow -up. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up 
includes any supplemental investigations necessary to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or causality of the adverse event. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consulta tion with other health care 
professionals. 
The Sponsor may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations of an adverse event. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a  recognized follow -up period, then Sponsor should be provided with a copy of 
any post-mortem findings, including histopathology, as required. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to the study medication (s) should be considered an adverse 
drug reaction. “Responses” to the infused cells means that a causal relationship between the study 
medication(s)  and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot 
be ruled out.

Clinical Study Protocol PT -001 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_829474] information. 
Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_248128] (inte nsity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to the infused cells using the categories of yes or no. 
The severity of all adverse events should be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
These criteria can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. For those adverse events 
not listed in the NCI CTCAE, the following grading system should be used: 
• Mild (CTCAE Grade 1): Transient symptoms, awareness of sign/symptom, but easily tolerated 
and no interference with subject’s daily activities; 
• Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with subject’s usual 
activities, but still acceptable; 
• Severe (CTCAE Grade 3): Incapacitating signs/symptoms that cause considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable;  
• Life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4): Life threatening or disabling adverse event; and  
• Death (CTCAE Grade 5): Death -related adverse event.  
AEs of infections will use both the CTCAE and the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN, Appendix G ) criteria . 
Causality Assessment:  
For this study, the Investigator should evaluate the relatedness of all adverse event s to 
investigational study medications (ProT mune ex vivo  programmed mPB cells  or Control mPB 
cells). Relatedness to non -investigational study medications ( conditioning medications  and GvHD 
prophylaxis medications) is only required for SAEs . Safety monitoring for adverse events for this 
study begins as of the start of the conditioning regimen and will be reported as per the requirements outlined in Section 8.1. 
The relationship of an adverse event to the study medication (s) is (are) to be assessed according to 
the following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of the study 
medication (s) and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of the study medication (s) and the 
occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study medication (s). This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
Fate Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol PT -001 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  74 • The temporal sequence from the study medication (s) administration:  
The event should occur during or after the study medication (s) is administered. The length of 
time from the administration of the study medication (s) to the ev ent should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject ma y have.  
• Concomitant drug: 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
• Known response pattern for study medication (s) adm inistration : 
Clinical and/or nonclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses:  
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical  and 
better explanation for the event. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event; 
NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889]; 
NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnight stay will be considered an in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room visit without hospi [INVESTIGATOR_256267] a 
SAE under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622819] e lective surgery should be recorded as adverse events and 
assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186223] (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will not be considered in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124052].  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• An important medical event.

Version 6.0, 29 March 2019  75 NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in  death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
8.3 Serious Adve rse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the start of the conditioning regimen (Day -10) until Day + 365, and only 
SAEs related to infused cells ( ProTmune ex vivo  programmed mPB cells or Control mPB cells )

8.6 Engraftment, Graft Failure, and Chimerism  
8.6.1 Neut rophil and platelet engraftment per CIBMTR 
ANC and platelets from the clinical laboratory assessments will be used to evaluate engraftment.  
• Neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first date of 3 consecutive laboratory values of an 
ANC ≥ 0.5 x 10
9/L obtained on different days. 
• Platelet engraftment is defined as the first date of 3 consecutive laboratory values of platelets ≥ 20 × 10
9/L obtained on different days without platelet transfusions within the 
preceding [ADDRESS_829480]  (in Phase 1). If donor engraftment 
is not present through Visit Day +[ADDRESS_829481]’s disease is not present, the subject is also considered as a primary graft failure (in the absence of relapsed disease).

Chimerism studies will be performed by [CONTACT_622881]/or flow cytometry according to local laboratory practices. When feasible, fractional chimerism (total, myeloid, lymphoid) will be performed from peripheral blood samples. If there is no evidence fo r donor engraftment by [CONTACT_2006] +21, then the subject will undergo 
BM and peripheral blood chimerism studies. If donor engraftment is not present by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_829483]’s disease is not present, the subject should be considered a primary graft failure (in the absence of relapsed disease).  
8.7 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Safety laboratory tests will include hematology and serum chemistry panels. Peripheral blood samples will be collected and forwarded to either local laboratories or central laboratories for testing as described in Appendix A .  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed (the analyses of which are the minimum): 
• Hematology (CBC and when possible per Institutional practice to include a differential  
(automated or manu al)): RBCs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, total white blood cell, 
neutrophils, bands, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes. Manual differential will include 
blasts if present and ANC calculation; and  
• Serum chemistry: includes creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, 
lactate dehydrogenase, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, chloride, CO
2, albumin, 
bilirubin (total and direct), and magnesium.  
Clinical laboratory test results should be within normal limits or for certain clinical laboratory tests, within an “acceptable” range based on disease characteristics.  
The results will be forwarded to the Investigator for review. Any abnormalities deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_622882] d recorded in the subject’s 
eCRF if they meet adverse event reporting criteria (refer to Section 8.1). Any clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory values that persist should be followed by [CONTACT_737]. Such events shoul d

The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population will include all subjects in the ITT Population 
who receive IP  (defined as either ProTmune or Control mBP units ). Subjects who are randomized 
and do not rec eive IP because the incoming donor mPB unit did not meet criteria  for

Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® (Version 9.3, or higher). 
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy  
Based on the timing from randomization to infusion of IP (defined as ProTmune or Control mP B 
units), a post -randomization screen failure may occur if the mPB donor collection unit fails to meet 
the requirements for ProTmune or Control processing (see Section 4.4). As such, the ITT 
population will only be used to summarize subject disposition.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed based on the mITT Population. Additional sensitivity analyses 
will be performed based on the PP Population for the  primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint 
for Phase 2. Efficacy data from the Phase 1 par t of the study and Phase 2 part of the study will be 
summarized separately. Summary tables will present results for each phase by [CONTACT_1570].  The primary efficacy endpoint is the cumulative incidence of CIBMTR Grades II through IV 
aGvHD through Visit Day +100 based on investigator results ; death and relapse without Grades 
II-IV aGvHD will be considered competing risks. Subjects who are alive with no occurrence of 
Grade II -IV aGvHD through Visit Day +[ADDRESS_829494] assessment for aG vHD 
on or prior to Visit Day +100.  Phase 1:  Cumulative incidence curves will be constructed for the primary efficacy endpoint along 
with curves for death and relapse without CIBMTR Grades II -IV aGvHD as competing risks. The 
first day of Grades II -IV aGvHD will be used to calculate the cumulative incidence curve. The 
estimate of the cumulative incidence rate of Grades II -IV aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +1 00 and the associated 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be estimated based on the cumulative incidence function 
with variance estimated using the Delta metho d. 
Phase 2:   The cumulative incidence curves and estimates of the cumulative incidence rate alon g 
with the associated 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be presented in the same manner 
described in Phase 1. The cumulative incidence functions for CIBMTR Grades II -IV aGvHD by 
[CONTACT_2006] +100 between the two treatment groups will be compared using Gray’s test ( Gray 1988) at a 
two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_829495] along 
with the 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the Fine and Gray’s sub- distribution 
hazard model ( Fine and Gray 1999) with tre atment and age as a covariate . Other covariates may 
be considered for model inclusion.   
The key secondary efficacy endpoi nt is the proportion of subjects alive without relapse and without 
moderate or severe cGvHD per NIH Consensus Criteria for the global severity score at Visit Day 
+365 using observed cases. Subjects meeting these criteria will be considered a responder.   Phase 1:  The number of subjects that are alive without relapse and without moderate or severe 
cGvHD at Visit Day +365  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Summaries will also 
include the number of subjects that are considered non-responders.

Statistical comparisons between treatment groups will be performed using a logistic regression  
with treatment and age as a covariate. Other covariates may be considered f or model inclusion.   
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be repeated 
using the PP population. For the responder/non- responder endpoint, analyses using non-responder 
imputation  cases will also be performed ; other methods may be explored to account for missing 
data such as  multiple imputation method s.    
All exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_622887], unless otherwise noted. For Phase 2, nominal 2- sided p- values 
(without adjustment for multiple comparisons) will be reported as a measure of the strength of association between the endpoint and the treatment effect rather than formal tests of hypotheses.  
Exploratory time -to-event endpoints in the presence of competing risks (e.g., aGvHD and cGvHD) 
will be performed using the cumulative incidence function in the same manner as the primary 
efficacy endpoint.  
Exploratory t ime-to-event endpoints will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estima tes and a two-
sided log -rank test to compare treatment groups. In addition, the hazard ratio along with the 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated using  a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment and 
age as covariates . Other covariates may be con sidered for model inclusion. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety  
The safety profile will be based on adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, engraftment, 
graft failure, chimerism, clinical laboratory assessments, and ECGs. All safety analysis will be 
based on the Safety Population. Safety analyses in general will be descriptive and will be presented by [CONTACT_622888]. Categorical endpoints will be summarized using number and percentage of 
subjects within each category. Continuous endpoints will be summarized descriptively with 
summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum).  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with a start date and 
time on or after the administration of investigational product. AEs that are designated as Gv HD-
related events per the investigator as indicated on the eCRF are considered signs and symptoms of 
GvHD. GvHD -specific details are also collected on separate eCRFs to assess  efficacy . As such, 
non-serious GvHD -related adverse events will not be included in the AE analyses and will be 
summar ized separately; GvHD -related AEs  that meet the criteria of SAEs will be included in the 
summaries of AEs and SAEs . The number and percent age of subjects with TEAEs will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_622889]. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study  and serious 
adverse events will be summariz ed by [CONTACT_1570]. By -subject listings will also be provided 
for any deaths, SAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study.

Descriptive statistics will be provided for ECG interval data and presented as both actual values and changes from baseline. Details of any abnormalities will be included in subject listings.  
9.2.3 Interi m Analysis  
During Phase 1, the IDMC  will convene to assess safety data as outlined in the IDMC Charter. At 
that time, the Sponsor, in consultation with and based on recommendations from the IDMC, will decide whether the study should stop or whether the Phase 2 study can begin. If the IDMC and Sponsor determine that there are no safety concerns based on Phase 1 safety data, Phase 2 study enrollment will begin.  
During Phase 2, the IDMC will convene according to the guidelines outlined in the IDMC Charter. There are no formal interim analyses  for efficacy  planned.

through Visit Day +100 between the ProTmune and Control groups. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoint 
H0 (null hypothesis): There is no difference in the proportion of subjects alive without relapse and 
without moderate or severe cGvHD per NIH Consensus Criteria at Visit Day +365 between the 
ProTmune and Control groups.    
H1 (alternative hypothesis): There is a difference in the proportion of subjects alive without relapse 
and without moderate or severe cGvHD per NIH Consensus Criteria at Visit Day +365 between 
the ProTmune and Control groups.    
Hypothesis testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.2.5 Sample Size Determination  
The background cumulati ve incidence rate of International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry 
(IBMTR) Grades B -D aGvHD in this population is assumed to be between 40% and 60% as 
reported in the literature ( Jagasia et al. 2012 ). 
Phase 1:  Allowing for a dropout rate of approximately 15%, approximately 8- 12 subjects will be 
enrolled to include 6-10 evaluable subjects.  Phase 2:  When accounting for competing risk factors (death or relapse without aGvHD), a sample 
size of 80 subjects ( 40 subjects in each treatment group) allows for approx imately 85% power to 
detect a reduction in the cumulative incidence rate of CIBMTR Grades II -IV aGvHD through Visit 
Day +100 from 55% to 25% (i.e., a hazard ratio of 0.3464) in the Control versus ProTmune 
treatment arms using a two -sided log -rank test at a 0.05 significance level. This calculation 
assumes the cumulative incidence rate for competing risk factors is 10% through Visit Day +100. 
Allowing for a dropout rate of approximately 10%, approximately 90 subjects will be randomized 
to include approximate ly 80 treated  subjects in the mITT Population. The sample size was 
calculated using PASS Sample Size Software ( PASS 1 6 Power Ana lysis and Sample Size 
Software, 2018).

Global Severity Scoring of Chronic GvHD   
Elements included in the proposed global scoring system include both the number of organs or 
sites involved and the severity within each affected organ (note that performance status scoring is not incorporated into the global scoring system). The global descriptions of mild, moderate, and severe were chosen to reflect the degree of organ impact and functional impairment due to chronic GVHD. Although scoring is often used at the time of initial diagnosis, evaluating the clinical score periodically during the course of chronic GVHD may revise prognostic expectations and better describe the current severity of chronic GVHD.  
Note that the global scoring system can be applied only after the diagnosis of chr onic GVHD is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_5640] (1) the presence of a diagnostic feature or, if a diagnostic feature is not present, (2) at least 1 distinctive manifestation of chronic GVHD with the diagnosis supported by [CONTACT_622894], radiologic, or laboratory evidence of GVHD from any site . 
Mild chronic GVHD  involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung: see below), with no 
clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs or sites).  
Moderate chronic GVHD  involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no 
major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more organs or sites with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.  
Severe chronic GVHD  indicates major disability caused by [CONTACT_190963] (score of 3 in any 
organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.

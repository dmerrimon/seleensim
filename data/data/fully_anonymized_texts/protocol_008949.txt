Safety Assessments : • Adverse E vents  (both spontaneous  and a solicited  subset of AEs )  
• Standard 12- lead ECG  
• Safety Laboratory Tests   
• Vital Signs  and pulse oximetry  
•  Physical Examination   
• Surgical site  e
xamination for bruising, bleeding  or drai
nage from

ence, infection and healing  
Trial Design:  C803 -028 is a randomized, parallel -group, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled ( Part 1) and active -controlled (Part 2) multi-
center  trial evaluating the safety  and efficacy of SABER®-
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL in patients undergoing elective outpatient 
laparoscopic cholecystec tomy.  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_4321] (See Sections 7.1, 11.3).  
For Part [ADDRESS_322822] 90% pow er (See Section 11.2) to meet  the prima
ry 
efficacy endpoint.  Approximately 274 eligible patients will be 
randomize d (See Section 5.3) in a  1:1 ratio to receive one of two  
treatments: 5 mL of SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265389] 15 mL of 0.5% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265390]. 
Five postoperative outpatient clinic visits will be scheduled  for 
assessment of safety parameters including AEs and surgical site 
examinations and for collection of rescue medication usage data.  All AEs , of whatever etiology and location , occurring after 
informed consent wil l be recorded on the eCRF .  All AEs  will be 
followed until resolution unless the patient is lost to follow up.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 126 Pain intensity 
Measurements:  During the first [ADDRESS_322823] drug administration (i.e., 
through S tudy Day 4/Postoperative Day [P OD] 3; See Table 1 ) 
pain intensity ,  on movement (defined as sitting 
up, or attempting to do so, from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]), will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_102].   Patients will use  an 11-point (0 -10) 
numerical pain rating scale (NPRS)  displayed by [CONTACT_265507] (LogPad®) to record their pain scores at specified times after 
administration of the test drug ( see Table 2: Patient LogPad 
Schedule of Events ).  Pain  intensity  on movement will 
also be recorded (1) prior to each IV fentanyl administration requested by [CONTACT_265508], and (2) at home before the 
patient self -administer s either one of two poss
ible rescue 
medication s (acetaminophen or oxycodone).   
  Patients should then record their pain -on-movement 
score by [CONTACT_265509], or attempting to do so, from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_265391]. If the 
patient is unable to sit up completely  due to severe pain, 
weakness, or lack of recovery from anesthesia, the patient should 
be instructed to make his or her best attempt, and that pain score 
will be recorded . 
Trial Population:  The trial population will consist of adult patients (males and 
females, 18  years of age and older) undergoing elective  outpatient 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy under ge neral anesthesia.  For 
Part 1, approximately 90 patients will be randomized.  For Part  2, 
approximately 274 eligible patients will be randomized  in order to 
obtain 264 evaluable patients (i.e., patients who receive d any test 
drug). It has been estimated that 4% of randomized patients may 
not receive any test drug due to unforeseeable intra- operative 
exclusion  (see Section 5.3). 
Test drug, dosage  
and mode of administration:  SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  5 mL (660 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196412]) will be 
instilled  with a blunt-tipped applicator directly into the four 
laparoscopic ports just prior to closure. The [ADDRESS_322824] Corporation Protocol # C803-028, Amendment 05 
 Protocol Amendment Date:  08 March 2017   
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 126 Comparator, dosage 
and mode of 
administration: 
 
 For Part 1  of the study, 5 mL of 0.9% s terile n ormal saline  will be 
instilled into the four laparoscopic ports in exactly the same way 
as SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. For Part 2 of the study, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40482], 15 mL of 0.5% solution (75 mg) without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], will 
be infiltrated into the four laparoscopic ports using a sterile 10 cc syringe and a 22 G x 1½ inch  hypodermic needle.  The dose 
should be divided between the four ports according to incision 
size in the same distribution proportion as for SABER
®-
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Refer to Section  7.3.[ADDRESS_322825] to describe the steps taken to ensure the bli nd is maintained as well 
as indicating which study staff will be blinded or un-blinded. 
Power Calculations:  For Part 2 of the study, 132  subjects enrolled in each treatment 
group of the study will result in 90% power (assuming 
type 1 error  rate of 5%) to detect a difference between 5 mL of 
SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 15mL of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265392]
 (the average 
pain on movement score during 48-hours post-dose). The sample-
size estimate was based on an estimated effect size of
 
 
see Section 11.2).

5.4 Trial Design  
C803-028 is a  randomized, parallel -group, double-blind, placebo-controlled (Part 1) and 
active -
controlled (Part 2), multi- center trial evaluating the safety  and efficacy of 
SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL in patients undergoing elective outpatient laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy.    
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_4321] (See Section 11.3) . For Part 1, it was planned to 
enroll approximately  320 eligible patients  (See Section 
5.3) in a 1:1 ratio  to receive one of two 
treatments: SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL;  or sterile normal saline  5 mL  (placebo ) instilled  
directly into the laparoscopic ports at the close of surgery.  The [ADDRESS_322844] drug is  divided 
between the multiple ports to provide coverage of all surgical incisions (see  Section 7.3.1) .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 126 patients, a pproximately 274 eligible patients (assuming 4% of patients may not be dosed due to 
unforeseeable intra-operative exclusion) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two 
treatments: 5 mL of SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265401] 15 mL 
of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265390]. 
Five postoperative outpatient clinic visits will be scheduled  for assessment of safety parameters 
including AEs  and surgical site examinations and for collection of rescue medication usage data. 
All AEs, of whatever etiology and location, occurring after informed consent will be recorded on 
the eCRF. All AEs will be followed until resolution unless the patient is lost to follow up . 
Resolution means no further changes in the event would be expected , i.e., the point at which a 
subject experiencing such an AE is appropriately treated and stabilized even though they may 
continue to experience lingering sequelae that may never resolve.

The primary e ffi
cacy endpoint is:  
• Pain intensity on movement measured at scheduled time points from  0-[ADDRESS_322848] ANOVA model of repeated measures  (MMRM) .  
To account for the impact of rescue medication use on the scheduled pain scores, the half- life 
substitution method will be used. Specifically, if the scheduled pain score has been assessed within one plasma half -lif
e after the use of rescue medication (IV or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_265402]),  and if the pre-rescue medication pain score is higher than the scheduled one, 
then the pain score recorded at the time of rescue medication administ ration will be 
substituted for the scheduled pain score (FDA, 2014) .  If a rescue medication pain score is 
missing, then the worst pain score up to that point will be substituted instead. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is: 
Pain intensity on movement measured at scheduled time points from 0-[ADDRESS_322849] 
ANOVA model of repeated measures  (MMRM). Additional secondary endpoints are:

should therefore observe the following anesthesia requirements, the obj ectives of which are 
threefold: (1) to reduce variability in the baseline (pre -dose) sta
te of the trial patients, (2) to limit 
the obscuring effect of excessive intra-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_265406], and (3) to ensure that potential confounders, such as the use of local or regional anesthesia, can be avoided.  
The anesthesia requirements are:  
• General endotracheal anesthesia 
• Midazolam, up to 2 mg, may be given pre- operatively  
• Propofol induction   
•
 Maintenance with inhalation al anesthesia (
sevoflurane or desflurane)  and an oxygen/air  
mixture.

o No total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) 
• Intra -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_265407], with a maximum dose of 
2.5 mcg/kg (including the induction dose) during the first hour the patient is anesthetized. 
If necessary, additional fentanyl may be given starting in the second hour, with a maximum dose of 1.0 mcg/kg during each subsequent [ADDRESS_322854] drug, even if 
previously randomized. 
 
o Any fentany
l given per patient complaint of pain after emergence from anesthesia 
will be considered rescue medication and will be limited to doses of 12.5 mcg or 25 mcg at minimum 5 minute intervals, as describ

In the PACU, pain may be treated with rescue analgesia (IV fentanyl in 12.5 or 25 mcg doses 
given at no less than 5-minute intervals).  IV fentanyl should be given only as necessary to 
control pain, only at the patient’s request, and not as a scheduled or prophylactic dose.  The 
patient’s pain score  on movement ( defined as sitting u p, or attempting to do so, f rom a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) should be assessed immediately before giving each rescue dose of IV fentanyl.  If the patient is  unable to sit up all the way due to severe pain, weakness,  or lack of recovery 
from anesthesia, the patient should be instructed to make his or her best attempt, and that pain  
score will be recorded.   The dose and time of administration of IV fentanyl and associated pain 
scores must be recorded on the patient’s chart and on the eCRF.  No IV acetaminophen, IV NSAIDs, or any analgesic drug (including Toradol

administration requested by [CONTACT_265508], and (2) at home before the patient self -

sters either rescue medication.   
  Patients should then record their pain -on-movement 
score by [CONTACT_265509], or attempting to do so, from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_265414]. If the patient is unable to sit up all the way due to severe pain, 
weakness, or lack of recovery from anesthesia, the patient should be instructed to make his or her 
best attempt, and that score will be recorded . 
If a patient is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_265415], pain assessments and 
rescue medication should follow the same instructions as for home use, to the extent possible.   
7.1 Patient Ran
domization 
It was planned that approximately 320 eligible patients would be randomized, in order to obtain 306 evaluable patients (i.e., patients who receive d any test 
 drug  and have at least one post -
surgical pain intensity score).  It had been estimated that 4% of randomized patients may not 
receive any test drug due to unforeseeable intra-operative exclusion.  P atients would be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments  based on a computer- generated 
randomization schedule prepared before the study :  Part 1  
• Treatment Group 1: SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL (POSIMIR®)(132 mg/mL, 660 m g 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196412])  
• Treatment Group 2: Sterile normal saline 5 mL  (0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP) 
(placebo ) 
Due to the early administrative stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], only approximately [ADDRESS_322873] Corporation Protocol # C803-028, Amendment 05

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 126 Approximately 274 e ligible patients will be randomized,  in order to obtain 264 evaluable patients 
(i.e., patients who received any  t
est drug).  It has been estimated that 4% of randomized patients 
may not rec eive any test drug due to unforeseeable intra-operative exclusion such as conversion 
to open cholecystectomy or need for a fifth port.  P atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive one of two treatments  based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared 
before the study :  Part 2  
• Treatment Group 3: SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL (POSIMIR®)(132 mg/mL, 660 mg 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196412])  
• Treatment Group 4: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265416], 15 mL of 0.5% solution (75 mg)  
 
 
 
 
 
Following scr
eening and confirmation  of eligibility, an interactive web response system (IW RS) 
will be used to assign patients to a treatment group .  The IWRS will confirm randomization via 
automatic notification to  the investigative s
ite.  
If all Screening (i.e. pre-operative) Inclusion/Exclusion criteria have been met , randomization 
can be done up to [ADDRESS_322874] the surgical proc
edure for unforeseen circumstances  (see Section 5.3.3)  or does not receive 
any test drug , replacement of the patient has been  planned. The IWRS system will be

balance of treatment as planned. Precise details on the IWRS algorithm have been  descr ibed in

instilled into the incision via the syringe -tip applicator. The applicator should be gradually 
withdrawn while instilling test drug to ensure even distribution throughout the wound, and mild upward tension on the suture ends should be maintained to ensure the test drug remains entirely within the wound.  The final knot will then be tied to complete closure of the incision. The patient number, drug vial number, date and time of drug administration (defined as the time of completion of administration), and the volume of test drug administered into each laparoscopic port will be recorded.    
The [ADDRESS_322881] drug should be
  distributed  according 
to the length of the port incisions and the function of the port.  The 10-12 mm ports—and especially the port used for extraction of the gall bladder —should receive proportionally more of

 Patients shoul
d then record 
their pain -on-movement score by [CONTACT_265509], or attempting to do so, from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_265445].  
Patients will assess their pain intensity using an 11 -point Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS) 
(Breivik et al. 2008; Hjermstad et al 2011 ; Cook et al 2013),  with numeric
al 
rating scale (NRS) scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 ( worst pain imag
inable ).  Each patient 
completes the N PRS by [CONTACT_265533] i n Table 2: Patient LogPad Schedule of Events  and prior 
to taking an oral rescue medication  through Study Day 4 ( POD 3 ). Prior to receiving  each dose 
of IV rescue
 medication  in the PACU, the patient’s pain score s  on movement (defined 
as sitting up , or attempting to do so, from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) should be assessed and site 
personnel will record it on the appropriate source document and eCRF.

9.3 Adverse Events  
9.3.1 Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject adm
inistered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign or symptom, including clinically significant labo ratory values and test results, concomitant 
illness, accident, or worsening of an existing medical condition. Adverse Event

• A pre -existing condition found as a result of screening procedures 
Any wor sening in severity or frequency of a baseline concomitant illness or any new illness

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 126 An adverse reaction (AR) is any untoward and unintended response to a test drug that has been 
considered to have a causal relationship with the treatment.  Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an adverse reaction that is serious 
and where the nature or severity of which is not consistent with information in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
An abnormal laboratory value (i.e. any clinical laboratory abnormality or change that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management [i.e. change of test drug dose, discontinuation of test drug , medical treatm ent, more frequent follow-up or 
diagnostic investigation]), will be regarded as an AE.  If clinical sequelae have been  associated 
with a laboratory abnormality the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (e.g. renal failure, hematuria) to replace the laboratory abnormality (e.g. elevated creatinine, urine RBC increased).   Abnormal Laboratory Value as an AE  
[IP_ADDRESS] Classifications  
A blinded Investigator will evaluate the severity of each adverse event using the following definitions: Severity  
Mild  – Transient symptoms, no interference with the patient’s daily activities  
Moderate – Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the patient’s daily activities  
Severe – Considerable interference with the patient’s daily activities  
An AE that has been  assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Sever ity is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An event should be  described as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes 
as described in  Section 9.3.1. 
A blinded Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between test drug and the occurrence of each AE/SAE.  The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the pharmacological action of the test drug  was
 responsible for the 
AE/SAE being reported.  Alternative causes such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the test drug  
will be considered and investigated.  The Investigator will also consult the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure an d/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her 
assessment.  Causality  
DURECT Corporation Protocol # C803-028, Amendment 05 
 Protocol Amendment Date:  [ADDRESS_322917] drug  applying the  
following definitions: 
Probabl y Related  – Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship 
Possibl y related  – A causal r elationship is conceivable  
Unlikely  related  – The eve nt is most likely related to etiology  other than the test drug    
Not Related  – Good reasons and sufficient documentation to exclude a causal relationship. 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is very important that the Investiga tor always make 
an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE Report Form to the Sponsor (or 
designee).  
9.3.2 Adverse Event Rep orting  
All events that meet the definition of an AE that occur in the period from when the patient has signed the infor
med consent form (ICF)  through trial completion  (final visit),  or early 
termination , must be recorded on the adverse event eCRF. All SAEs will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF and on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form from the time writ ten 
informed consent has been  obtained through trial completion ( final visit), or early termination . 
At each contact [CONTACT_265541] (visit or phone), after the pa tient 
has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator should inquire about the occurrence of AEs.  The following are examples of open-ended questions that may be used to obtain this information:  
“How are you feeling?”  
“Have you had any medical problems since your last visit/assessment?”  
“Have you taken any new medicines, other than those given to you in this study, since your last 
visit/assessment?”   
All AEs and SAEs will be documented in source records at each assessment time or  when 
otherwise volunteered by [CONTACT_265542] e CRF. Information to be 
collected includes the nature, date and time of onset, severity , durat 
ion, relationship to test drug, 
and outcome of the event.  Even if the Investigator ass esses the AE as not reasonably attributable 
to the test drug, its occurrence must be recorded in the source documents and reported on the 
eCRF  along with the assessment of association . 
The Investigator will treat the patient as medically required , and this may extend beyond the 
duration of the trial.  The Investigator will record treatment and medications required to treat AEs on the appropriate e CRF(s). All AEs  will be fol
lowed until resolution (no further changes in

 Protocol Amendment Date:  [ADDRESS_322918] experiencing such an AE is appropriatel y  
treated and stabilized even though they may continue to experience lingering sequelae that may 
never resolve ) unless the patient is lost to follow up .   
DURECT will evaluate all AEs with respect to seriousness, causality and expectedness in 
accordance with Directi
ve 2001/20/EC  (3) and FDA Guidelines.  The expectedness of an AE 
will be determined according to the current version of the Investigators Brochure.

The Investigator must indicate  the SA
E’s relationship to t est drug and sign the SAE form.  When 
additional relevant information (final diagnosis, outcome, results of specific investigations, etc.) 
becomes available, the investigator must record that follow-up information in the eCRF .  Follow-
up information should be recorded according to the process used for reporting the initial event as described above.  The in vestigator will follow all reportable events  (i.e., SAEs) until resolution . 
Resolution means no further changes in the event would be expected, i.e., the point at which a subject experiencing such an AE is appropriately treated and stabilized even though t hey may 
continue to experience lingering non-serious sequelae that may never resolve.    
Safety Surveillance will follow all SAEs until resolution ( no further changes in the event are 
expected, i.e., the point at which a subject experiencing such an AE is appropriatel
y treated and 
stabilized even though they may continue to experience lingering sequelae that may neve r 
resolve).  Safety Surveillance will report all SAEs to DURECT within 1 business day of receipt.    
All serious adverse events will also be reported on the AE CRF and concomitant medications 
administered in association with the serious AE will be documented on the CM CRF. 
If a serious adverse event occurs and comes to the attention of the Investigator after trial 
completion/termination within [ADDRESS_322920] trial visit 
(whichever occurs later), it must be reported immediately to Safety Surveillance in the same 
manner  as the serious adverse events occurring during the trial.  Investigators are not obligated to 
actively seek AEs from former study participants.  
The Investigator must report SAEs to the IRB/IEC (per the IRB/IEC guidelines/SOPs), including all SAEs that have occurred at the investigative site  and a 
ll trial related SAEs that have resulted 
in an expedited safety report to a regulatory agency.  Concurrently, the Investigator must send DURECT documentation of such IRB/IEC notification or if reporting is not required

11.3 Patient Ran
domization  
It was planned that a pproximately  320 eligible patients would be randomize d, in order to obtain 
306 evaluable patients (i.e., patients who receive d any test drug  and have at least one post -
surgical pain intensity score).  It had been estimated that 5% of randomized patients may not 
receive any test drug due to  unforeseeable intra-operative exclusion.  P atients would be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments  based on a computer- generated 
randomization schedule prepared before the study :  Part 1  
• Treatment Group 1: SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL (132 mg/mL, 660 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196412]) 
• Treatment Group 2: Sterile normal saline 5 mL  (0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP) 
(placebo ) 
Due to the early administrative stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], only approximately 90 s
ubjects will be enrolled and 
randomized in Part 1 . 
Approximately 274 eligible patients will be randomized,  in order to obtain 264 evaluable patients 
(i.e., patients who are randomized and  
receive d any test drug).  It has been estimated that 4% of 
randomized patients may not receive any test drug due to unforeseeable int ra-operative 
exclusion.  P atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two treatments  based on a 
computer- generated randomization schedule prepared before the study :  Part 2  
• Treatment Group 3: SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5 mL (132 mg/mL, 660 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196412])  
• Treatment Group 4: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861], 15 mL of 0.5% solution 
(75 mg) 
For both Part 1  and 2, the randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_265545]

 trial, the Sponsor will assess the appropriateness of allowing the 
center to continue randomizing additional subjects into the trial based upon factors such as monitored site performance including documentation and protocol compliance. An IWRS system will be used to assign subjects to a treatment group.  
If all Screening (i.e. pre-operative) Inclusion/Exclusion criter ia are met , randomization can be 
done up to [ADDRESS_322930] the surg
ical procedure for unforeseen circumstances  (such as conversion to open surgery, or the 
need to use more than 4 laparoscopic ports) or does not receive any test drug, replacement of the patient has been  planned. IWRS system will be algorithmically instructed to issue the appropriate 
randomization replacement and to ensure the balance of treatment as planned. Precise detai ls on 
the IWRS algorithm will be described in the IWRS specifications.   
11.4 Definition of Analysis Population  
ITT Population : The ITT population will cons
 ist of  all randomized patients  in both Part [ADDRESS_322931] drug or completion  of surgery.  However, t he primary 
efficacy analysis will include only Part 2 data.  
Safety Population:  The Safety population will consist of all subjects  in bot h Part [ADDRESS_322932] drug.  The Safety population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT)  
 Population:  All randomized patients in both Part [ADDRESS_322933] drug.  However, t he primary efficacy analysis will include only 
Part 2 data.  
All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the mITT set.  
11.5 General Statistical A nalysis Considerations  
The primary efficacy analysis will include only Part 2 data.  Due to the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265472] 1  
enroll
ment, for secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, the efficacy data from the 
SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265473] 1  will be integrated with the same treatment arm from Part 
2 and be compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (75 mg) over 72 hours.  Inferential statistics will be 
derived from the comparison. Due to lack of f ull enrollment of subjects from Part 1 , the efficacy 
will be descriptive, presented as either mean or ratio and its 95% confidence interval as 
appropriately applied. 
Continuous variables will be generally summarized using descriptive statistics such as mea n, 
median, standa
rd deviation, standard error and ranges.  Categorical variables will be summarized 
using frequencies and percentages. 95% confidence intervals will also be provided when 
appropriate. Inferential tests for the analysis of continuous variabl es will be primarily based on 
parametric general linear models and will be 2 -sided and conducted at the overall 
5% significance level unless otherwise stated.

 violated, nonparametric methods of analysis such as the Wilcoxon Rank- Sum test 
will be used.  A data transformation will also be made in an attempt to achieve a successful normalization of non- normal data. Inferential tests for categorical variables will be based on 
logistic regression models and categorical data analysi
s models.  In cases where the cell counts 
(i.e. percentages) are too small for asymptotic methods to be valid, exact tests such as Fisher’s exact test will be used.  
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests will be conducted employing a  two-sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
11.6 Methodology f
or Dropouts and/ or Missing Data 
For the primary efficacy endpoint (scheduled pain on movement, adjusted for prior re
scue 
medication use ) the repeated measures ANOVA will handle data missing at random.  However, 
detailed tabulation of the amount, percentage of subjects, and pattern of missing data by [CONTACT_265547].  Two approaches will be used to impute a missing  
pain scor
e. For any dropout prior to [ADDRESS_322935] (WOCF ; Imputation for Missing Pain Score  
FDA, 2014 ) will be used. For dropouts due 
to other reasons or intermittent missin g values, a multiple imputation algorithm (Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo method [MCMC] ) will
 be used ( Yuan, 2010) .  The detailed implementation  of these 
analyses  will be desc
ribed in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
If it is indicate d on the LogPad that no rescue medica tion was used , a dose of zero milligrams 
will be imputed.   The lack of rescue medication use will be verified using data from the site 
rescue medication reconciliation/pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].   If there is a discrepancy between the rescue 
medication entered in the LogPad and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_265474], the LogPad results will be 
used for analysis.  Rescue  Medication Use  
 
For any time to event variable ( e.g., time to the first use of  a rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_265475]), the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to analyze it by [CONTACT_265548] a 
subject has the first event or the entire follow -up time when a subject does not have the event. 
For the latter , the variable will be censored at the time of last follow -up.  No imputation will be 
made.  Time -to-Event Variables

cal Analyses of Efficacy Endpoints  
The principal analyses of the  primary efficacy endpoint will be carried out based on the modified 
Intention- to-Treat ( mITT)
 set comprising all randomized patients who receive trial drug  in 
Part 2. 
11.8.1 Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
The pri
mary efficacy endpoint is:  Part 2  
• Pain intensity on movement measured at scheduled time points from  0-[ADDRESS_322938] ANOVA model of repeated measures (MMRM)  
To account for the impact of rescue medication use on the scheduled pain scores, the following substitution method will be used. If the scheduled pain on movement score has been  assessed 
withi
n one plasma  half-life after  the use of rescue medication (IV or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], or 
acetaminophen) , and if the pre-rescue medication pain score is higher than the scheduled one, the 
pain score will be censored and the rescue medication  pain score will substitute  for it (FDA, 
2014) .  If any of the rescue pain scores are missing, then the worst pain score up to that point will 
be used instead.   
Data derived from the assessment of pain intensity on movement will be used 
to test the 
hypothese s as described 
below: 
Null hypothesis : 
There is no difference in analgesic e
ffect between subject s treated with SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265476], as measured by [CONTACT_265549] 
0-[ADDRESS_322939] and imputation for 
missing pain scores. 
Alternate hypothesis: 
There is a difference in analgesic effect  between subjects treated with SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265477], as measured by [CONTACT_265549] 
0-[ADDRESS_322940] ANOVA model of repeated measures  
(MMRM).  The model includes the following f
ixed effect s: sex stratum, treatment, sex by

nsitivity analysis of the primary e ndpoint  
In addit ion to the primary analysis , several sensitivity analyses will als o be employed  as below:  
• Pain intensity on movement measured at scheduled time points from  0-[ADDRESS_322942] drug administration, adjusted for rescue medication use. The adjustment 
algorithm will be as such: If the scheduled pain on movement score has been  assesse
d 
within one plasma  half-life after  the use of rescue medication (IV or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], or 
acetaminophen), the worst pain score from all observed ones prior to using rescue 
medication, if this score is higher than the pre-rescue pain score, will be used to substitute the scheduled pain score. 
• Pain intensity on movement measured at scheduled time p oints from  0-[ADDRESS_322943] ANOVA model of 
repeated measures (MMRM)  (i.e. no adjustments for rescue medication use) 
• Analyze the observed cases without imputation for missing pain scores 
• Analyz e completers over 0-[ADDRESS_322944] drug administration only 
• Treat all missing
 pain as “failures” using WOCF imputation.  
11.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For all secondary efficacy endpoints, data from SABER®-Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265478] 1  will be 
combined with the same treatment arm in Part 2. The integrated data will be compared to 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. 
• Pain intensity on movement measured at scheduled time points from 0-[ADDRESS_322945] ANOVA model of repeated measures (MMRM).  The key secondary efficacy endpoint:  
The adjustment algorithm for rescue medication use is the same as described for the primary endpoint in  Section 11.8.1. 
• Total IV morphine-equivalent dose of rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_265386] 0-[ADDRESS_322946] drug administration (standard conversion factors will be  used to convert di

There is no planned interim analysis. An  interim analy sis will only be implemented if the Safety 
Assessment Committee ( SAC ) stops the trial (see  11.9.1) for safety .  Safety data will be 
monitored in a blinded manner t
hroughout the study  in accordance with the Safety Monitoring 
Plan.  Unblinded review of SAEs will be conducted by [CONTACT_265554], in accordance 
with the SAC Charter and as described below in Section 11.9.1.  The Safety Assessment 
Committee comprises three members that are independent of the
 study (medical professionals 
and a statistician ).

 Part 2 of the trial.    
[IP_ADDRESS] General 
Provisions  
• The Sponsor medi
cal monitor will c arefully and routinely monitor the blinded 
safety data for any occurrence of SAEs, will promptly provide all SAE data to the 
SAC and will convene 
an SAC meeting if any safety  events require an immediate 
review by [CONTACT_942] . 
• The period of observation will be based on safety data reported during the 60- day 
post-treatment period.   
• The SAC will
 be responsible for determining whether SAEs provided to them 
meet the requirements for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356], as set forth in SAC Charter
 sections 
4.2 and 4.3. To make this determination, the SAC at its discretion, may choose to 
un-blind the case for detailed examination.  
• The bupi[INVESTIGATOR_265489]- risk 
surgical procedure and will be at no greater risk than those undergoing 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy outside of the PERSIST clinical trial.  For that 
reason, SAEs occurring in the control group will not constitute trial-stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265490], although they could prompt revision of the trial protocol if deemed appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265491]- treatment fatality has been reported. The 
reported fatality will be un -blinded and all available clinical data will be investigated and

Superficial incisio nal SSI 
Must m eet the following criteria: 
Infection occurs within 30 days after any NH SN operative procedure 
(where d ay 1 = the procedure date), inclu ding those c oded as 'OTH ' * 
AND 
involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision 
AND 
patient has at least Q!!£ of the following: 
a. purul ent drainage from the superficial incision. 
b. organisms i solated from an aseptically-obtained culture 
from the superficial incision or subc utaneous tissue. 
C. superficial incision that is de liberately opened by a s urgeon, 
attendin g physician ** or other designee and is culnir e positive 
or not cul tured 
AND 
patient has at least Q!!£ of the following signs or symptoms: pain 
or tenderness; localized swelling; er ythema; or h eat. A cul ture 
negative findin g does not m eet this criterion.

Comments Ther e are two specific types of superficial incisional SSis: 
1. Superficial Incisional Prim ary (SIP) - a s uperficial incisional SSI 
that is identified in the primmy incision in a patient that has had an 
operation w ith one or more incisions (e.g., C-section incision or 
chest incision for CBGB ) 
2. Superficial Incisional Seco ndary (SIS) - a s uperficial incisional 
SSI that is identified in the secondary incision in a patient that has 
had an op eration w ith more than one incision (e.g., donor s ite 
incision for CBGB)

defin ition of superficia l SSI: 
• Diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis (r edness/warmth/swe lling), by i tself, 
does not meet criterion d for superficia l incisional SSI. An incision 
that is d raining or c ultur e(+) is not considered a celluliti s. 
• A s titch abscess alone (minim al in flammation and discharge confined 
to the po ints of suture penetration) 
• A l ocalized stab wound or pin site infection. W hile it would be 
consi dered e ither a skin (SKIN) or soft tissue (ST) infection , 
dependin g on i ts depth, it is not repo rtable under this module. 
Note: a laparosco pic trocar site for an NH SN operative procedure is 
not considered a stab wound. 
• Ci rcumcision is n ot an NHS op erative proced ure. An infected 
circumci sion s ite in newborn s is classified as CIRC and is not 
reportable under this mo dule. 
• An infecte d bum wound is classified as BURN and is not reportab le
